FEATURES OF QUANTITATIVE PROCESSES ACCORDING TO MARTING PROCESSES Introduction Quantile processes corresponding to martingale processes are observed in the work.
  In particular, martingale processes with equal distribution with respect to point 0 are considered.
It is shown that the quantiles of martingales are increasing from time to time.
A similar result can easily be obtained for finite-bearing martingale processes (i.e., for martingales whose carrier represents a compact domain at any given time).
  Additional restrictions are required to solve this problem for endless carrier martingales.
The initial additional constraint is the symmetry of the distributions with respect to point 0 և monomodality (having one mode).
For quantum processes corresponding to martingale processes, such a property is particularly interesting in the case of quantum regressions, quantum autoregressions, as in the case of quantile correlation models (see [1]).
 The latter attempt to explain (mostly linearly) the conditional quantities of a conditionally random quantity (see [2], [3]).
  As a slope coefficient in these cases they often get time-dependent increasing coefficients for the same level of quantiles (see [2]).
In a sense, there is not enough data to make such regressions for martingale processes.
  For some processes, the significance of such regressions will lead to the linearity of the data process over time.
  However, in the case of martingale processes, there is not even a functional dependence.
Main result Only martingale processes with continuous distribution will be observed.
 That is, if the process {𝑋𝑡} 0 [0, 𝑇] is a matrix, then each կունենա will have a continuous distribution.
  For quantum processes corresponding to such processes, the designation 𝑄𝛼, է is used, where α is the level of the quantum and s is the moment of time.
 The process 𝑄𝛼, բ satisfies the condition 𝑃 (𝑋𝑠 ≤ 𝑄𝛼, 𝑠) =։.
Insist.
  Suppose we have a finite time interval [0, T] որոշակի a certain martingale defined on that interval according to the flow of natural σ-algebras (ie 𝐸 (𝑋𝑡 | 𝑋𝑠) ​​= 𝑋𝑠, any 𝑡 𝑠 𝑠).
  Suppose that 𝑋𝑡s for all 𝑡 ∈ [0, 𝑇] have symmetric distributions with respect to point 0.
 Suppose, in addition, that the representation takes place where ℎ ′ ′ (𝑢) <𝑓 ′ ′ (𝑢) (here 𝑓𝑡 | 𝑠 (𝑢 | 𝑥) is the conditional distribution density).
  In that case there is 𝛼>
  such that 𝑄𝛼, 𝑡> 𝑄𝛼, 𝑠 for all 0 ≤ 𝑠 <𝑡 ≤։.
Remark.
 First of all, it should be noted that the martial process that meets the above condition always exists.
  For example, the Laplace distribution school.
 One can be sure that the above statement is correct for that process.
  The assertion is true for natural martingales, only "between quantum signs".
Proof.
  For proof, let us first state that 𝑄1
  .
  Here it is necessary to use the fact that for even distribution with a dot punctuation, math. expect the median to be the same.
  On the other hand, the average of the martingale process is the same for any given moment.
Rethinking all this, one can write.
On the other hand, using monomodality, it can be argued that when, 𝑡 և 𝑋𝑠 ≥ 𝑄1
, 𝑠, 𝑓𝑡 (𝑥), 𝑓𝑠 (𝑥) are decreasing.
If 𝑓𝑡 (𝑄1:
, 𝑠), then there exists 𝑦> 𝑄1
,։ such that 𝑓𝑡 (𝑦) = 𝑓𝑠 (𝑦) (otherwise 𝑓𝑡 (𝑥) <𝑓𝑠 (𝑥) will always be large ը the above will not happen).
 It is obvious that, 𝑠 ≤ 𝑋𝑠 ≤ 𝑦).
It remains to show that 𝑓𝑡 (𝑄1
, 𝑠).
 For that we use the condition of martial arts.
Note that 𝑃 (𝑋𝑡 ≤ 𝑦) <𝑃 (𝑋𝑠 ≤ 𝑦).
 That is, if we take y as, կետ) then the first point where 𝑦 (=) = 𝑓𝑠 (𝑦) is 𝑄1
  from (𝑄1:
it will suffice to show that և ∈ [𝑄1:
for 𝑦] 𝑓𝑡 (𝑥) <𝑓𝑠 (𝑥).
It follows from the condition of ինգ 𝑋𝑡 մարտ martingale that.
This condition can also be written as follows:
In fact, this condition occurs in any range.
  Note that = 𝑥.
In particular, the above integral operator may have a finite number of cores (𝑓𝑡 | 𝑠 (𝑢 | 𝑥)).
  However, using the assumption, we can get from where, denoting, we have: 𝑔𝑡, 𝑠 (𝑥) = 𝑎𝑡, 𝑠𝑥 ∶ Using the condition, we get Now remember that հիշ (𝑢) is decreasing when 𝑢> 𝑄1
 .
 Therefore, so և, 𝑠 (𝑢).
Moreover: 𝑓𝑡 (𝑢) = ℎ𝑡, 𝑠 (𝑢).
 Taking advantage of the fact that h (u) decreases more slowly than 𝑓𝑠 (𝑢), the assertion was proved.
