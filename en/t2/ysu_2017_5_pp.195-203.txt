ABOUT THE SUPPLEMENTATION OF THE SUPERCOMES DETERMINED BY THE GROUP Arbitrary "defined for the subgroup" determined for the group.
 The nucleus of ոմ → ոմ homomorphism is (with isomorphic accuracy) in the corresponding exact product է is the normal subset of the subgroup.
As a consequence, the "hypergroup" assigned to the group is complemented only if the normal subset of the subgroup is trivial in the corresponding exact product.
1. Introduction և Preliminary information about group-oriented hypergroups The concept of group-defined hypergroup has been introduced in [1], then improved in [4] և [5].
  This concept generalizes և unites the concepts of group space, field նկատմամբ field to field.
  The grouped hypergroups have a number of applications: generalization of Schreier's theorem on group extensions [5], results on group cohomologies, and so on.
In [5], the concept of a (right) hypergroup defined by a group is defined as follows.
  Let's be an arbitrary group.
  The (right) hypergroup assigned to a group is called 𝑀 the set 𝛺 = (𝛷, 𝛹, 𝛯, 𝛬) together with the system of structural representations, where: • (𝛷) 𝛷.
 𝑀 × 𝐻 → 𝑀, 𝛷 (𝑎, 𝛼) ∶ = 𝑎𝛼, • (𝛹) 𝛹.
 𝑀 × 𝐻 → 𝐻, 𝛹 (𝑎, 𝛼) ∶ = 𝛼 • (𝛯) 𝛯.
 𝑀 × 𝐻 → 𝑀, 𝛯 (𝑎, 𝑏) ∶ = [𝑎, 𝑏], • (𝛬) 𝛬.
 Արտ × 𝐻 → 𝐻, 𝛬 (𝑎, 𝑏) ∶ = (𝑎, 𝑏) the expressions satisfy the following conditions: P1) է is a double operation 𝑀 on a set such that (i) for an arbitrary 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝑀 elements in the equation [𝑥, 𝑎] = ում in a unique solution 𝑀, (ii) (𝑀, 𝛯) has left neutral element, that is, there exists 𝑜 ∈ 𝑀 elemental such that [𝑜, 𝑎] = 𝑎 for an arbitrary 𝑎 ∈ 𝑀 element.
P2) 𝛷 mapping 𝐻 is a group operation 𝑀 on a set, ie (i) (𝑎𝛼) 𝛽 = 𝑎𝛼 ∙ 𝛽 for arbitrary 𝛼, 𝛽 ∈ և 𝑎 ∈ 𝑀; elements; (ii) 𝑎𝜀 = 𝑎 for arbitrary ∈ ∈, element; where ը is the neutral of the 𝐻 group.
P3) For the arbitrary element 𝛽𝑜 ∈ գոյ there exists an element 𝛽 ∈ պիս such that 𝛼 = 𝛽𝑜.
P4) The following identities occur: This subgroup assigned to a group is denoted by։.
 When considering the 𝑀𝐻 hyper group determined by grouping, let us assume that 𝛺 =
(𝛷, 𝛹, 𝛯, 𝛬) is its system of structural representations, 𝐻 𝐻 is the neutral element of the group, and 𝛯 ձախ is the left neutral element of the double action.
 We will use the designation և 𝜃 = 𝛬 (𝑜, 𝑜) −1.
(Note that in algebra the term "hypergroup" is used for another object.
  This notion of a hypergroup was introduced independently by F. Martin ([6]) և H. Ս. Wall ([9]) (see also [3]).
 The notion of this hypergroup used in this article will be confusing if we call the hypergroups defined for the group abbreviated as hypergroups.
In this article we will use the following properties of hypergroups (see [5] page 9). • (𝐴11) (𝑎, 𝑜) = (𝜃 − 1).
Suppose և և են are hypergroups, respectively 𝛺 =
(𝛷, 𝛹, 𝛯, 𝛬) և 𝛺 ′ = (𝛷 ′, 𝛹 ′, 𝛯 ′, 𝛬 ′) with structural mapping systems.
 A morphism of hypergroups is called a pair of representations 𝑓 = (𝑓0, 𝑓1), where 𝑓0 ∶ 𝐻 → է is a group homomorphism, 𝑓1 ∶ 𝑀 𝑀′ ՝ is a set in the representation of sets, that is, the structural representations are preserved, ie The following equations: • (𝑀𝛬) Λ◦𝑓0 = (𝑓1 × 𝑓1) ◦Λ ′.
The condition (𝑀𝛯) means that 𝑓1 is a homomorphism from (𝑀, 𝛯) (𝑀 ′, ′ ′).
The simplest example of morphism is identical morphism. 1𝑀𝐻 = (1𝐻, 1𝑀) ∶:
 𝑀𝐻 → 𝑀𝐻.
 For arbitrary morphisms of hypergroups, their combination 𝑓◦𝑔 = (𝑓0𝑓0, 𝑓1◦𝑔1) և is a morphism of hypergroups.
  𝑓 = (𝑓0, 𝑓1) morphism is inverted (hence isomorphism) if 𝑓0 𝑓 𝑓1 the expressions are inverted.
  In that case − − 1 = (𝑓0
−1) is the inverse morphism of 𝑓 = (𝑓0, 𝑓1) morphism.
[5] (page 3) describes the standard hypergroup formation path defined for a group as follows:
 Suppose (𝐺, 𝐻,։) is an arbitrary trio consisting of 𝐺 group, its 𝐻 subgroup 𝐺 𝐺 group 𝐻 subgroup աջ (right) transversal.
  Recall that in 𝐺 group 𝐻 the subgroup (right) of the subgroup is called the 𝑀 subset of, for which | 𝑀 ∩ (𝐻 ∙ 𝑎) | = 1 for any arbitrary element։ ∈։.
𝐺 group 𝑀 subset 𝐺 in group աջ subgroup to the right of the transversal և only if է is an additional set to the right of 𝐻, that is, for an arbitrary 𝑥 ∈ 𝐺 element there exist only 𝛼 ∈ 𝐻 և𝑎 ∈ ∈ elements such that 𝑥 = 𝑎 ∙ 𝑎 (see, for example, [8] p. 178).
 Therefore, if ում in the 𝐺 group աջ is the right transverse of the ախ subgroup, then for the arbitrary 𝑏, 𝑏 𝑀 և 𝛼 ∈ 𝐻 elements 𝑎 ∙ 𝛼 և 𝑎 𝑎 միակ the elements are represented by a single egg as the product of the elements of ի և 𝑀։.
 Therefore, the expressions 𝛷, 𝛹, 𝛯, կարելի can be defined according to the conditions (𝑆𝑡1) և (𝑆𝑡2). • (𝑆𝑡2) 𝑎 ∙ 𝑏 = (𝑎, 𝑏) ∙ [𝑎, 𝑏] = 𝛬 (𝑎, 𝑏) ∙ 𝛯 (𝑎, 𝑏).
These representations satisfy the conditions P1) -P4) (see [5], pp. 3-5), և the corresponding իպ hypergroup is called a hypergroup derived from the standard (𝐺, 𝐻, 𝑀) triad.
Construction in a standard way has the following universal feature. any 𝑀𝐻 hypergroup with isomorphic accuracy is obtained in a standard way from one of the triplets (𝐺, 𝐻, 𝑀) ([5], pp. 11-12).
 [5] in which the trio is constructed as follows.
  Suppose է is an arbitrary hypergroup, consider ությունը the set whose elements are 𝛼𝑎 two letter words where ն և են տարր are elements from ից to և համապատասխան respectively.
  In [5] (page 9) վրա defines a double action as follows: ∙ (𝑎𝛽, 𝑏)) [𝑎𝛽, 𝑏].
It is proved ([5], pp. 9-10) that հետ together with the defined double action is a group with 𝜃𝑜 a neutral element.
Definition 1.
  The 𝐺 group is called the exact product of the 𝐻 group 𝑀 ՝ related to the 𝑀𝐻 hypergroup.
Considering the subsets of,, it is proved ([5], p. 11) that է is a subgroup of, and ում is a transversal of the subgroup ում in the 𝐺 group.
 It is also proved ([5], pp. 11-12) that the "hypergroup" isomorphically obtained from the trio (𝐺, 𝐻, 𝑀) is a isomorph to the hypergroup.
2. A complete hyper group related to a hypergroup.
Suppose է is an arbitrary hypergroup with a system of structural representations 𝛺 = (𝛷, 𝛹, 𝛯,։).
  According to the definition of a hypergroup P2), ն n 𝐻 is an action of the group (right) 𝑀 on a set.
 It is well known (see, for example, [8], p. 55) that any group action exerts a homomorphism from that group to the symmetric group of that set in the following way.
 𝐻 → 𝑆𝑀, 𝛷 (𝛼).
 𝑀 → 𝑀, 𝛷 (𝛼) (𝑎) = 𝛷 (𝑎, 𝛼) = 𝑎𝛼.
Definition 2.
  𝑀𝐻 A hypergroup is called a complete hypergroup, if միջ the nucleus of homomorphism is trivial: 𝑘𝑒𝑟𝛷 = {𝜀}.
Since է is a normal subgroup of 𝐻, we can consider the expressions 𝐻 ′ = 𝐻 / 𝑘𝑒𝑟𝛷 որդ 𝑘𝑒𝑟𝛷, ′ ′, ′ ′, 𝛬 𝛬. ′ ′.
 𝑀 × 𝐻 ′ → 𝑀, 𝛷 ′ (𝑎, 𝛼 ′) ∶ = 𝑎𝛼, 𝛹 ′.
 𝑀 × 𝐻 ′ → 𝐻 ′, 𝛹 ′ (𝑎, 𝛼 ′) ∶ = 𝑘𝑒𝑟𝛷 ∙ 𝛼 𝛯 ′.
 𝑀 × 𝐻 ′ → 𝑀, 𝛯 ′ (𝑎, 𝑏) ∶ = [𝑎, 𝑏], 𝛬 ′.
 𝑀 × 𝐻 ′ → 𝐻 ′, 𝛬 ′ (𝑎, 𝑏) ∶ = 𝑘𝑒𝑟𝛷 ∙ (𝑎, 𝑏).
Lemma 1.
 ′ ′ Եւ ′ ′'s representations are set correctly.
Proof.
 The correctness of և և 𝛹's representations means that ′ ′ (𝑎, 𝛼 ′) և ′ ′ (𝑎, 𝛼 ′) do not depend on the choice of the ′ ′ adjacent class 𝛼 representative.
  Suppose 𝛼, 𝛽 ∈ 𝛼 տարբեր are different representatives of the same adjacent class.
  In that case 𝛼 ′ = 𝛽 ∙ 𝛼 = 𝑘𝑒𝑟𝛷 ∙ 𝛽, so there exists an element 𝜅 ∈ այն such that 𝜅 ∙ 𝛼 = 𝛽.
  Since 𝜅 ∈ 𝑘𝑒𝑟𝛷, then 𝑎𝜅 = 𝑎author 𝑀 ∈ համար for the element.
To show the correctness of է, it is necessary to show that 𝑎𝛼 = համար for an arbitrary 𝑎 րի element.
  We will get it according to the conditions P2) (i) և 𝜅 ∈ ՝: 𝑎𝛽 = 𝑎𝛼 ∙ 𝜅 = (𝑎𝛼) 𝜅 = 𝑎𝛼.
To show the correctness of անհրաժեշտ, it is necessary to show that 𝑎 for an arbitrary ∈ 𝑀 element.
  For that, show 𝑎 for an arbitrary 𝑎 𝑀 𝑀 element.
 We will give (𝐴1) that 𝛽 ∈i և 𝜅 ՝ ՝, so it suffices to show that 𝜅 ∈ ∈
This is the same as for 𝑀 𝐴 𝐴 (𝐴2) = = 𝑏 arbitrary 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝑀 elements.
 According to the arbitrary element 𝑎 ∈։.
where, according to P1) (i), we get 𝑏 = 𝑏 𝜅 for the elements.
  arbitrary 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝑀Theorem 2.
  𝑀 set և 𝐻 ′ = 𝐻 / 𝑘𝑒𝑟𝛷 number-group 𝛺 ′ =
(′ ′, ′ ′, ′ ′, 𝛬 ′) together with the system of representations satisfy (𝛷 ′, ′ ′, ′ ′, ′ ′) is a hypergroup of the system of structural representations of the group որոշ որոշ.
to the conditions, the crowd is proof.
 Consider 𝑝0.
 ′ → 𝐻 ′ natural epimorphism և 𝑝1 = 1𝑀.
 → →:
𝑀 Identical representation.
According to the definition of 𝛷 ′, 𝛹 ′, ′ ′, 𝛬 ′ expressions (𝑝0, 𝑝1) the expression pair holds 𝛺 = (𝛷, 𝛹, 𝛯, 𝛬) և ′ ′ =
(′ ′, ′ ′, ′ ′, 𝛬 ′) expression systems, ie the (() - (𝑀𝛬) relations occur.
 It is proved (see [5], pp. 14-15) that in that case, if 𝑝0 is an epimorphism and 𝑝1 is a longitudinal representation, then 𝛺 համակարգը the representation system satisfies the conditions P1) -P4).
Thus, the arbitrary 𝑀𝐻 hypergroup is regularly associated with the 𝑀𝐻′hypergroup, determined with respect to the խմբի ′ = 𝑘𝑒𝑟𝛷 / 𝑘𝑒𝑟𝛷 coefficient group (see [2]).
Theorem 3.
 Է is a complete hypergroup.
Proof.
 Suppose համար ′ (𝑎, 𝛼 ′) = համար for an arbitrary element 𝑎 ∈։.
 Let us show that 𝛼 ′ = 𝑘𝑒𝑟𝛷.
  Suppose 𝛼 ′ = 𝑘𝑒𝑟𝛷 ∙ 𝛼, in which case, according to the 𝛷′ definition, 𝛷 ′ (𝑎, 𝛼 ′) = 𝑎𝛼, then for an arbitrary 𝑎 ∈ 𝑀 element.
  It will follow from the latter that 𝛼 ∈ 𝑘𝑒𝑟𝛷, therefore 𝛼 ′ = 𝑘𝑒𝑟𝛷.
Definition 3.
  The ′ ′ hypergroup is called the լր hypergroup related to the whole brought hypergroup.
Now suppose է is an arbitrary group, է նրա is its subgroup.
Definition 4.
  𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑒𝐺 (𝐻) = ⋂ 𝑥 − 1 ∙ 𝐻 ∙ 𝑥:
  Is called a normal subgroup of the Centgroup in group։.
It is known (see, for example, [7], p. 16) that 𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑒𝐺 (𝐻) is the maximum normal group subgroup 𝐺 contained in subgroup։.
Suppose the 𝑀𝐻 hyper group is obtained in a standard way from the trio (𝐺, 𝐻, 𝑀).
Theorem 4.
  The nucleus of ոմ homomorphism in 𝐺 group է is the normal subset of subgroup, ie 𝑘𝑒𝑟𝛷 = 𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑒𝐺 (𝐻).
Proof.
 According to the standard way of constructing hypergroups, ում is a transversal of the 𝐻 group 𝐻 subgroup, therefore it is an additional set, that is, for an arbitrary element գոյ գոյ գոյ there exist only 𝛼 կամ և և ∈ 𝑀 elements such that 𝑥 = 𝛼 𝑎 𝑎.
 Consider 𝜌.
 𝐺 → 𝑆𝑀, 𝜌 (𝑥).
 Արտ → 𝑀, 𝜌 (𝑥) (𝑏) = [𝑏𝛼, 𝑎] mapping.
Lemma 5.
1) For arbitrary elements 𝛼 ∈ 𝐻, 𝑎 ∈ 𝑀 𝜌 (𝛼 ∙ 𝑎) is an extension.
2) J is a group homomorphism.
Proof.
  1) According to P1) (i), the equation [𝑥, 𝑎] = ունի has a single solution in ((for arbitrary elements 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈)).
  If we denote the solution by 𝑏 /,, it is not difficult to see that the expression 𝑦 ↦ (𝑦 / 𝑎) −1 is the inverse of 𝜌 (𝛼 ∙ 𝑎).
  Therefore 𝜌 (∙ ∙:
𝑎) is an extension.
2) Suppose 𝑥 = 𝛼 ∙ ն և և 𝑦 = 𝛽 𝑏 ն are arbitrary elements of։.
 According to (𝑆𝑡1), (𝑆𝑡2), P2) (i), (𝐴4) և (𝐴2) we get 𝑏) (𝜌 (𝛼 ∙ 𝑎) (𝑐)) = (𝜌 ( 𝛼 ∙ 𝑎) ◦𝜌 (𝛽 ∙ 𝑏)) (𝑐) = (𝜌 (𝑥) ◦𝜌 (𝑦)) (𝑐).
for an arbitrary։ ∈ 𝑀 element.
Lemma 6.
  𝛷 mapping is the constraint of վրա on the subgroup այսինքն, ie 𝜌 (𝛼) = 𝛷 (𝛼) for an arbitrary 𝛼 ∈ րի element.
Proof.
  Since է is obtained in the standard way, then, according to (𝑆𝑡2) և P1) (ii), Subtracting from the right 𝑜, we get 𝑜 = (𝑜, 𝑜) = 𝜃 − 1.
  Thus 𝜀 = 𝜃 ∙ 𝑜.
𝑜 ∙ 𝑜 = (𝑜, 𝑜) ∙ [𝑜, 𝑜] = (𝑜, 𝑜) ∙ 𝑜.
Therefore, according to (𝐴10) և P2) (i) for any arbitrary element։ ∈։.
To prove Theorem 4, we will show that 𝑘𝑒𝑟𝜌 = 𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑒𝐺 (𝐻), from which we will get that 𝑘𝑒𝑟𝜌 ⊂ 𝐻, therefore, according to Lemma 6, we will have that 𝑘𝑒𝑟𝛷 = 𝑘𝑒𝑟𝜌 = 𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑒𝐺 (𝐻).
Suppose 𝑥 =։ ∙ 𝑎 ∈ 𝐺, և 1𝑀 is the identical expression of 𝑀 set.
  In this case, according to (𝑆𝑡2) և (𝑆𝑡1), the following equivalences occur. Which, according to the unity of (𝑆𝑡1) և (𝑆𝑡2) analysis, is equivalent. Thus, ՝ ∈ 𝑏 − 1 ∙ ∙ 𝑏 ∀𝑏 ∈ ∈ .
= 𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑒𝐺 (𝐻).
The theorem is proved.
Remark 1.
  Theorem very close to Theorem 4 can be found in the theory of precursors (see, for example, [7], p. 35).
Remark 2.
  According to the universality of the standard way of constructing hypergroups, Theorem 4 can be formulated for any arbitrary hypergroup. Theorem 4 '.
  For an arbitrary 𝑀𝐻 hypergroup 𝑘𝑒𝑟𝛷 is isomorphic in the 𝐺 group նորմալ to the normal subset of the subgroup 𝑘𝑒𝑟𝛷 ≅ 𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑒𝐺 (𝐻).
Example 1.
  Suppose the structural representation of a 𝑀𝐻 hypergroup է is trivial, that is, for arbitrary 𝑎 ∈ 𝑀, 𝛼 𝐻 𝐻 elements 𝛷 (𝑎, 𝛼) = 𝑎𝛼 = 𝑎.
In this case, it is clear that for an arbitrary 𝛼 𝛼 𝐻 element 𝛷 (𝛼) is նույն the identical expression of the set, 1𝑀, hence 𝑘𝑒𝑟𝛷 = 𝐻.
 Therefore, the complete hypergroup related to the 𝑀𝐻 hypergroup is the 𝑀 {𝜀 ′ եր hypergroup determined with respect to the trivial {𝜀 ′} = {𝑘𝑒𝑟𝛷} group.
Note that if the complete given hypergroup related to the խ hypergroup is the 𝑀 {𝜀 ′ եր hypergroup, then (𝑀, 𝛯) is a group.
 Indeed, we have that (𝑀, 𝛯) =
(𝑀, 𝛯 ′), and for 𝑀 {𝜀 ′ 𝛯′ որոշում determines a group action on 𝑀 set.
  The latter follows from the well-known result that any double action of a force satisfying the conditions P1) (i) և P2 (ii) is a group action.
  Note that in this case the double action 𝛯 է is concomitant, since in (𝐴4) we will have ′ ′ (𝑎, 𝛬 ′ (𝑎, 𝑏)) =
𝛷 ′ (𝑎, 𝜀 ′) = 𝑎.
A question arises. If (𝑀, 𝛯) is a group, will the fully derived hypergroup related to the իպ hypergroup be determined with respect to the trivial group, that is, will be the 𝑀 {}}} hypergroup.
 It turns out that in the general case the answer to this question is negative.
Example 2.
 Suppose է is a group, ու and ը are subgroups of, such that 𝐺 = 𝐻 ∙ 𝑀, 𝐻 𝑀 𝑀 = {𝜀}, where 𝐺 is the neutral element of the group,, և ը 𝐺 is not a normal subgroup (as such (𝐺, 𝐻, 𝑀) a triple can be considered 𝐺 = 𝑆3 symmetric group, its 𝐻 = {(1), (12)} և 𝑀 = {(1), (123), (132 )} subgroups).
  It is not difficult to be sure that in this case կլինի will be the transversal of the Gent group in 𝐺 group.
  Consider the 𝑀𝐻 hyper group obtained from the trio (𝐺, 𝐻, 𝑀) by the standard way.
  Since է is a subset of,, then, according to (𝑆𝑡2), we will have that (𝑎, 𝑏) = 𝜀 for arbitrary 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ համար for the elements, then կհ will match 𝑀 on ի 𝐺 with double action, so (𝑀, 𝛯) will be a group.
  We have that է is a complete hypergroup related to the եր hypergroup, therefore, according to Theorem 4, 𝐻 ′ = 𝐻 / 𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑒𝐺 (𝐻).
  If ը is a trivial group, let's denote that 𝐻 = 𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑒𝐺 (𝐻), hence that է է is a normal subset of,, which is incorrect.
