LEVEL OF PHARMACEUTICAL CARE IN YEREVAN PHARMACEUTICAL NETWORK Pharmacological care (PH) is a complete program of cooperation between a pharmacist and a doctor during the entire course of drug treatment, ie from the release of the drug to the end of its effect.
First of all, pharmacological care is intended for the protection of patients, as the pharmacist is a link between the doctor and the patient.
 There are medicines that can be dispensed with a doctor's prescription; there are medicines that can be dispensed without a prescription.
  When it comes to prescription drugs, it is the duty of the pharmacist to follow the doctor's instructions, "check the dosage once" and provide the patient with information about the medication.
 And when patients go to the pharmacy without a prescription or to see a doctor, the pharmacist should examine the signs, the course of the disease, refer them to a doctor or give a medicine (over-the-counter) that will alleviate the patient's condition.
 Doctors must prescribe all medicines in the territory of the Republic of Armenia (except for over-the-counter medicines) [3].
  Prescriptions must be issued on the basis of prescriptions approved by the Government of the Republic of Armenia [4].
The purpose of the research.
 Assess the level of awareness of pharmacy staff and customers about pharmaceutical care, as well as find out the level of maintenance of pharmaceutical care in pharmacies.
