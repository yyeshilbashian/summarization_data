  They can be used as ionites, especially for translucent membranes, for the separation of difficult-to-dissolve liquids and gases, as sensitive sensors for quantifying various substances, such as for obtaining environmentally safe electricity from natural energy [1].
  Used for these purposes և can be used polyanilines, polytiophene, polypyrrole, poly-p-phenylene և etc.
 As electroactive polymers, polymers containing aromatic triazene groups, which can exhibit photoconductivity in the long wavelength region of light (300-550 nm), have not been studied among polymerized polymers.
  Combined polyaryls containing 1․3 triazendyl units in the parent chain, due to their unique chemical structure, presence of tautomers և E, Z-isomers, as well as good complexing agents, may be of some interest as electroactive polymers.
  Polymers containing the 1․3-triazendyl group are photosensitive compounds ևStudied for application in microelectronics [3-8].
Complexes of triazene-containing polymers with Fe, Cu, Zr, Pd և Ru are used as catalysts [9, 10].
  In terms of the study of electrical properties նոր new possibilities for the application of polymers, the group of polymers that has been little studied և, the industrial synthesis of which is easily feasible, are the combined polyaryls containing the basic polymer chain triazene-1․3-diyl units.
One of the methods for obtaining triazene-containing polymers is the combination of aryldiazonium salts with amines.
  Combined triazene group-containing polymers were obtained by this method based on benzidine [11], as well as triazene group-coupled polymers were synthesized by p-phenylenediamine's assay by p-phenylenediamine affluence [12].
 Based on the scientific data of the field, as well as taking into account the fact that so far there are very few coupled polymers containing the basic chain triazene group, synthesized combined polymers containing the main triazene groups have been studied by combining the triazene groups into NH2 / NH-based Nm2 base group. -d (4-aminophenyl) 1,4-benzoquinonodiimin), 4 1,4-di [N (4-aminophenyl) -1,4-benzoquinonodiimin-N'-yl] benzolamine [13].

Doping of polymers with iodine. To a certain weight of the polymer was added a certain volume of 0․178 N iodine tetrachloride solution, left at room temperature in a dark place for 3 days.

  The filtrate was titrated with sodium thiosulfate solution in the presence of starch.
Depth of soil to a pan, which impedes rooting, is calculated based on both the titration and the increase in the weight of the polymer after doping.
