  As of 2014, there were 105 museums (including branches) in Armenia, 28 specialized theaters, 868 libraries2.
  Armenia is rich in historical and cultural monuments, churches and monasteries.
  In general, it should be noted that the UNESCO World Heritage List includes the monastic complexes of Haghpat, Sanahin, Geghard Monastery, the Upper Azat Valley, the churches of Etchmiadzin, the Mother Cathedral, and the Zvartnots Archaeological Cathedral.
 The list of candidates includes the ruins of Dvin, the ruins of Yereruyk temple, Tat monastic complex, Tat desert, Vorotan valley, Noravank monastic complex և Amaghi valley3.
There is a considerable resource base for the development of the medical-resort type of recreation.
 The "Research Institute of Spa and Physical Medicine" CJSC of the RA Ministry of Health has singled out 10 resort zones in Armenia, which have all the necessary natural healing resources for the development of sanatorium-rehabilitation tourism: mineral water, healing mud, peat, climate treatment.
  These resort areas are: Arzni, Dilijan, Hankavan-Marmarik, Bjni-Arzakan-Aghveran, Tsakhkadzor, Stepanavan-Gyulagarak, Syunik, Lori, San, Jermuk4.

disease, the rate of illness decreases, etc., that is, the social output is transformed into other sectors of the economy (increasing the capacity to work increases labor productivity, reduces the number of diseases, health care costs, etc.).
  Taking into account the analysis of McKinsey's tourism assets, we can say that Armenia has all the opportunities to develop recreational tourism in Armenia (as Armenian resorts have high medical-biological, psychological-aesthetic, geographical, ecological values, there is a rich historical and cultural heritage).
Summing up, we can state that the geographical location of the Republic of Armenia, the peculiarities of the landscape, the favorable climatic conditions, the presence of mineral waters, natural and historical-cultural monuments serve as a basis for the development of recreational tourism in the Republic of Armenia.
  Therefore, in order to develop this sphere in the Republic of Armenia, it is necessary to take into account the historical-cultural and resort resources of each place when developing and implementing a program for the development of separate tourist and resort areas, and to base them on their potential.
