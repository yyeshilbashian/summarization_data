Sci. Head: Tech., Prof. A. Arakelyan The paper discusses a behavioral model dedicated to analytics.
Investment The problem under study can be classified as information deficiencies in the financial markets of the countries.
The following situation is considered that mimics the investment behavior of an individual. It is assumed that the investor, based on his risk-taking preferences, tries to place his initial wealth (savings) between two risky "non-risk assets".
  In other words, he makes a choice between financial portfolios (note that the observation of only two assets does not violate the common approach, because according to Sharp-Lintner-Moss 19 Markovitz's problem can be attributed to can be viewed as risky).
  Suppose at some point there is a change in external conditions (exogenous factors), for example, the wealth of the investor, the yield of a reliable asset.
 Our task is to find out how, in other equal conditions, the investor will react to those shocks with his decision.

Under this data we solve problem (2) with 21 "internal point" algorithm.
 Then և (cid.
1875) (cid.
2868) we add by 10 points, we leave the remaining parameters unchanged և we solve problem (2) again.
 The simulation continues until (cid).

 The following figure (Figure 1) illustrates the relationship between initial wealth օ optimal risk asset investments.Chart 1. The relationship between optimal risk asset investment և initial wealth է for exponential preferences.
Absolute magnitude, regardless of Figure 1, can be inferred from a risky investor, but from investment wealth.
  It is difficult to depend significantly on the type of investment preferences obtained.
The same exercise for sliding utilization gives the following picture. Figure 2. Relationship between the "initial wealth" of optimal risk asset investments for sliding preferences.
It is clear from Figure 2 that the higher level of savings in this case leads to an increase in investments in risk assets.
  Moreover, it is interesting that unlike the first example, in the case of the sliding utility function (cid).
1831) ((cid.
1844))> (cid.
1870) under the precondition all savings are directed to risky assets.
  It turns out that the fact that the risk-averse asset of a risky asset is below the expected stable return will lead to a complete sliding investment into a non-risky asset in the run-up to the election.
The following observation is crucial for drawing conclusions from the analysis. It is easy to verify that exponential preferences are characterized by a degree of fixed risk aversion, and that the absolute risk aversion factor for the sliding utility function decreases with wealth.
  From here, the behavioral mechanism that explains the effect of income on investment behavior becomes obvious. If the investor's propensity for risk increases (decreases, remains unchanged) along with the growth of the initial wealth, then, naturally, the non-risk investments increase (decrease, remain unchanged).
The application of the theorem of the unknown function.
  In the numerical examples, we were essentially comparing equilibrium states corresponding to model (2).
  Note that due to the parameterization, the model offers not a single equilibrium, but a set of equilibrium states that depend on exogenous factors.
  Understandably, in the general case (2) it is quite a difficult task to obtain the solution of model (2) explicitly (in one of the articles we tried to approach the solution by extending the general view of the utility function to Taylor 22).
  It turns out, however, that with the help of the explicit function theorem, it is possible to estimate the marginal effects of the return on wealth իսկ non-risky assets without obtaining an analytical view.
The first order condition of (2) has the following form: (cid.
