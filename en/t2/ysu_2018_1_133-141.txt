QUALITATIVE QUANTITATIVE PHYTOCHEMICAL RESEARCH METHANOLAE EXTRACTS USED IN ARMENIAN TRADITIONAL MEDICINE Continued in the world.
 This is mainly due to the development of resistance of the most widely used antibiotics in the world today [1].
 Antibiotic resistance has become one of the greatest problems of mankind since the end of the 20th century.
  The increasing level of antibiotic resistance is mainly due to the widespread use of the latter without restrictions [2].
 The demand for new antibiotics, which will be able to successfully fight resistant bacterial strains, has greatly increased.
 Traditional methods of detecting the latter are no longer effective enough due to the fact that microorganisms are rapidly becoming resistant to them [2].
 Therefore, new sources of antimicrobial compounds are now being used more extensively.
Plant organisms may be one of the most promising sources for the discovery of new antibiotics [2, 3].
 Plants with antimicrobial properties due to their natural origin are also considered safe compared to those obtained synthetically.
 It is known that a quarter of current drugs are derived from herbal compounds.
 Antimicrobial compounds isolated from plants, compared to traditional antibiotics, may have different targets for microorganisms, hence the different mechanism of action [4, 1].
Plants have an unlimited ability to synthesize secondary metabolites.
 These are mainly of ecological importance for plants; in many cases, they participate in the defense processes against microorganisms, insects and herbivores.
 Some, such as terpenoids, give plants a characteristic odor, while others (quinones, chitans) are responsible for coloring.
 Many secondary metabolites provide the unique aroma of plants (for example, the terpenoid capsaicin from chili pepper).
  Many of these herbs and spices that people use to spice up their food serve as useful medicines.
Their secondary metabolites are mainly responsible for the antibacterial effect of plants [5, 6].
 The main groups of plant compounds that may have antimicrobial activity are: phenols-polyphenols (flavonoids, quinones, tannins, coumarins, etc.), terpenoids, alkaloids, saponins, steroids, peptides, , 8, 9].
The flora of Armenia is rich in many unique species belonging to different families of herbs, shrubs and trees.
 Wild herbs are widely used, which have been used for medicinal purposes in scientific and folk medicine since ancient times.
The aim of the work was to study the qualitative-quantitative phytochemical composition of methanolic extracts of some herbs used in Armenian traditional medicine.
Object of research և methods.
  Object of study Agrimonia eupatoria L. (whole plant), Hypericum alpestre subsp. Polygonifoli ւ m (Rupr.) Avet. & Takht. (aboveground part), Rumex obtusifolius Willd (seed) և Sanguisorbaofficinalis L. (aboveground part) plants with high antimicrobial activity were selected based on preliminary studies [11, 12].
The plants were collected and dried on dry and dry days.
 Immediately after collection, the plant material was completely washed with running water, rinsed with water, shaded and placed in a dryer for 10 days in conditions of good ventilation.
 The dried plant material was pulverized by means of a homogenizer and stored at her room temperature in hermetically sealed glass containers.
Extraction of plant tissues was carried out by slaughter using methanol (98%) 10.
1 (solvent volume / plant mass) ratio [13].
 The resulting mass was actively mixed with vortex ևPlace in the refrigerator (24 hours at 50 C).
   The test tubes were then centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 6 minutes.
 The supernatant was filtered with 1 Watt filter և dried (vacuum dryer BOV-50V, Biobase Meihua Trading, China) at 400 ° C.
 Solvent was added to the precipitate։ The process of complete dissolution of active substances was repeated three times.
  The combined dry extract was weighed, transferred to the ependorffs and stored in the freezer (-180 C) for further use.
Qualitative phytochemical studies of methanolic plant extracts have been performed by standard methods [14].
Quantitative determination of phenolic compounds was performed by the Folin-Chocaltau method.
 To 0.5 ml of extract was added 2.5 ml of 10% Folin reagentև 2.5 ml of 7.5% Na2CO3.
 Incubation was performed at 40 ° C for 40 minutes.
The measurements were made with GENESYS 10S UV-VIS spectrophotometer, the wavelength is 765 nm.
 An appropriate amount of methanol was added to the test instead of the extract.
  Values ​​were expressed in μg / gallic acid equivalent / mg (GTE / mg).
 The obtained results are presented in the mean ± standard deviation with values ​​և analyzed by Microsoft Excel.
Quantitative determination of flavonoids was performed by colorimetric method of aluminum chloride.
 To 0.25 ml of extract was added 0.75 ml of methanol, 0.05 ml of 10% ALCL3, 0.05 ml of 1M Na-K tartrate և 1.4 ml of distilled water.
 Incubation was performed at room temperature for 30 minutes.
  The measurements were made with an spectrophotometer, the wavelength is 415 nm.
  In the control, ALCL3 և Na-K tartrate was replaced by methanol.
 Values ​​were expressed in μg quercetin equivalent / mg (Ke / mg).
 The results are presented in mean ± standard deviation values ​​են analyzed in Microsoft Excel.
Quantitative determination of tannins was performed by the vanillin method.
 To 0․05 ml of extract was added 3 ml of 4% vanillin alcohol և 1․5 ml of concentrated HCl.
 The incubation was carried out at room temperature for 15 minutes.
 The measurements were made with a spectrophotometer, the wavelength is 500 nm.
 In the control, the extract was replaced with an appropriate amount of methanol.
  Values ​​were expressed in μg catechin equivalent / mg units.
 The results are presented in mean ± standard deviation values ​​են analyzed in Microsoft Excel.
Research results և their discussion.
 The results of qualitative phytochemical studies of methanolic extracts of A. eupatoria, H.alpestre, R. obtusifolius և S. officinalis (Table 1) showed that coumarins, tannins, flavonoids և phenolic compounds are present in all four plants, and terpenoids only in R. near.
The methanolic extracts of all four plants do not contain the alkaloids - cardioglycosides.
 Saponins և flobatanin are absent only in S.officinalis plant, and steroids in R. obtusifolius և S. officinalis plant extracts.

Table 1. Qualitative phytochemical composition of methanolic extracts of studied plants (-a - absent, + b - present) Quantitative examination of total phenolic compounds (Graph 1) showed that the highest amount of total phenolic compounds are present in A. eupatoria in the extract (358.9 μg GTE / mg).
The total amount of total phenolic compounds in the methanolic extracts of H. alpestre և S.officinalis was 263.3 և 327․2 μg GTE / mg, respectively.
 The total amount of phenolic compounds in the methanolic extract of R. obtusifolius was only 92-6 μg GTE / mg.

Schedule 1 ․ The total amount of phenolic compounds in the studied plants (n = 3), p <0.05 The results of quantitative examination of flavonoids in plant extracts (Graph 2) showed that the highest amount of flavonoids were present in H. alpestre extract (78-8 μg K / mg).
  In the methanolic extracts of A.eupatoria, R. obtusifolius և S. officinalis, flavonoids are 26.23, 47.37 և 34.73 μg Ke / mg, respectively.
The highest content of tannins was observed in the methanolic extract of H. alpestre (27-78 mcg equivalent of catechin / mg, Graph 3).
 In the methanolic extracts of A. eupatoria, R. obtusifolius և S. officinalis, the tannins are 21.5, 23-93, 1․99 μg of catechin equivalent, respectively.
The high content of phenolic compounds in A. eupatoria extract is mentioned in other works.
 In particular, Muruzovich showed that the acetone extract of the plant contains 220 mg of GT / g total phenolic compounds, which, however, is significantly lower than the data we received (348.34 μg GT / mg).
 This may be due to the fact that methanol solutes more substances, including phenolic compounds.
 According to the data of the same authors, the amount of total flavonoids contained in the acetone extract of A. eupatoria in the dry extract is 97.06 mg rutin equivalent / g (mg RUE / g).
Another study [17] showed that flavonoids accounted for approximately 42% of total polyphenols in S. officinalis methanolic extract, compared with 12% in aqueous extract.
