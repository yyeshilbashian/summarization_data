ANTHROPOGENIC CHANGES IN THE RA FOREST LANDSCAPES About 70 thousand square kilometers of forest are destroyed annually on the planet Earth without replenishment.
  The ever-increasing anthropogenic impact on forests, the pollution of the environment, the changes in the chemical composition of the global climate զգալի significantly worsen the state of forest vegetation.
Currently, forests cover less than 1/3 of the Earth's surface.
 This is the minimum limit at which stable biosphere functions are still possible.
In the following centuries, along with economic development, the rates of deforestation have increased.
  Since the 60s and 70s of the XX century, every minute, the planet Earth loses about 30 hectares of forest, and the area of ​​tropical forests is shrinking at a rate of 1% per year.
  Mankind uses about 55% of the annual growth of forest timber for its needs.
Until recently, forests were perceived in the public consciousness as a source of timber and other biological resources.
In recent years, the world's forests have begun to be seen as the most important global factor in the sustainable development of society.
Although the diverse importance of forests is currently recognized by many governments - foresters as well as the public - the forest policies of many countries continue to be dominated not by the protection of the environment and biodiversity, but by the expected benefits of forest exploitation.
The current forest areas of Armenia make up about 1/3 of the forest cover that existed 4000-6000 years ago.
  This is evidenced by the situation in recent years, the studies carried out.
  Analyzing the geographical uses of that period, the data of dust analysis վերլուծ the results of numerous studies, it was possible to find out that 4000-6000 years ago the present territory of the Republic of Armenia, in all probability, could physically bear 35% forest cover [6].
The modern distribution of archaeological landscapes is the result of developments during the Holocene during the Upper Quaternary.
  Landscape change, in combination with natural factors, K.A. Starting from the III millennium, today it has the most anthropogenic influence.
In the literary sources of the first millennium և, the first half of the second millennium AD, only fragmentary reports on the use of forests in the current territory of the Republic of Armenia are found. Evidence that does not allow to form a complete picture of the total forest cover of the RA.
 However, considering the numerous studies dedicated to the nature of the Republic of Armenia during the XIX century կես in the middle of the XX century մասնավորապես, in particular, the vegetation cover, it can be assumed that in the first millennium առաջին in the first half of the second millennium
  It was connected with the difficult socio-economic conditions of Armenia, the loss of independence, the constantly repeated wars and raids.
  Like other natural resources, a large amount of timber was exported from the country.
 Huge areas of forest were simply burned and destroyed [3, 5].
In the 17th-18th centuries, the forest cover of the Republic of Armenia was quite fragmented, which was connected with the direct influence of the development of cattle-breeding on the upper edge of the forest, the expansion of grasslands, and the lower edge of the development of agriculture.
In the following periods, the impact on the forest area increased, especially due to the large-scale development of the mining industry and the general economy since the end of the XVIII century.
  During that period, on average, 60-70 thousand were cut annually. m3 of wood to get the necessary amount of charcoal.
  In the 18th century, according to the analysis of rich sources, the forest cover in Armenia was about 18% [6] (Figure 1).
Due to the negative impact on the forest cover, the latter was significantly reduced; in the first years of Soviet Armenia it was about 10% of the area.
  1930-1950s Large-scale deforestation was considered for the development of the RA economy, due to which the forest cover reached the minimum area in 1960.
The timber needed for the development of the economy of Soviet Armenia was taken from the sparse mountain forests of the Republic of Armenia, as at that time there was still no large-scale procurement of timber from Russia.
The growth of forest geosystems is explained in 1950-1970. Large-scale afforestation of Lake Sanaa (16,000 hectares), as well as Yerevan, Vanadzor and other cities.
  On the other hand, the volumes of regular, illegal logging in connection with the import of timber from Russia were substantially reduced in Armenia.
  From 1956 to 1986, the area of ​​forest geosystems increased by 1% or 3087 ha each year, with a total of 92347 ha [6].

  1991 The Republic of Armenia became independent.
  In the following years, serious political and economic trials awaited the country.
  Independence from the USSR, 1988 devastating earthquake, 1988-1994 The war situation led to the transport, economic and energy blockades of the republic.
It was calculated that in the 1990s. 50% of the forest energy consumption came from the use of firewood.
1991-1996 The volume of permitted deforestation was about 100000 m3, which satisfied 10-15% of the RA domestic demand for timber products.
  It has been calculated that in 1997-2002. The annual volume of unregulated illegal logging was 1 million m3.
  As a result of the Armenian-Swedish afforestation works carried out in 1997-1999, the volume of permitted, unregulated and illegal logging during 1991-1996 was 600,000 m3 [6].
The average annual volume of cuttings in 1992-2005. 13-14 million m3, which is several times more than the absolute annual growth (450,000 m3).
  It is this circumstance that causes the degradation of the forests of the Republic of Armenia շարունակ the continuous reduction of the forest cover.
1986-1989 և 2000-2001 Analyzes conducted in the GIS environment show that the impact of man on forest cover has increased significantly since independence, becoming comparable to deforestation in the mid-20th century.
Figure 2. RA forest cover in 1988 (Landsat TM) և 2000 (Landsat ETM +) [5] In the years following independence, no national forest survey was carried out.
 This gap is to some extent filled by the results of satellite imagery.
  In particular, for 1988 և 2000, maps were compiled based on forest cover analysis from two different sensors on the Landsat satellite (Figure 2).
  The change of the forest cover of the Republic of Armenia in the historical past և is currently given in Table 1.

In the National Forest Inventory of 100000 scale map maps, the assessment of forest area by 2000 according to literary sourcesAbout 245 000 About 30 000 About 30 123 * 1993 There are no reliable cartographic materials or summary reports on the RA forest cover, due to which the mentioned forest area is suspicious.
** The mentioned forest resource is also doubtful, because it is largely based on subjectively conducting state-owned, collective-degraded degraded forests, young plantations, mechanically forest series.
*** Ter-Ghazaryan K. et al.1995 detailed analysis-report of the RA forest sector shows that in the first years of Independence the RA forest cover was 300 000 ha or 10%, which is more real than 334100 ha or 11, 2%.
**** These figures from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) contradict previous publications of the same organization (FAO, 2001, 2005).
Significantly reduced current forest cover is a whole of fragmented forest masses, which in the conditions of ongoing global warming, anthropogenic pressure can not carry out effective environmental, socio-economic functions.
According to official data, the forest fund of the Republic of Armenia is 459,900 hectares, of which 334,100 hectares are forested, or 11․2% of the total area.
  On a global scale, the per capita area is 0 մեկ67 ha of forested area, while in Armenia this indicator is 0 ցուցանիշ1 ha.
 The forests of the Republic of Armenia have an unequal distribution; traditionally the northeastern part of the country's forests is separated.
62%), South-Eastern (36%) ևNortheastern parts of central Armenia were once covered with mountainous forests, but later most of the forests were destroyed by humans.
The main forest species of the Republic of Armenia are beech, oak and hornbeam, which occupy 81․3% of the forest area, 5 ,3% of the remaining tree species, pine, juniper, ash, birch, linden, aspen and shrubs - 13․4%.
  In terms of wood resources, beech is in the first place, then oak և hornbeam (Figure 3).
Figure 3. Distribution of RA forest cover by area occupied by trees (a) և by tree vegetation reserve, m3 (b) [4] By age groups, 47% of RA forests are middle-aged, 26․3% mature-mature, and 10․6%: young.
  The low number of young hens indicates that the forest is aging and the natural restoration processes are insufficient.
  According to numerous studies, natural sperm regeneration is very insufficient in oaks, with which in some cases there is an undesirable change of species, the oak replaces the hornbeam.
  Natural sperm regeneration is relatively good in bokhuts և mats.
More than half of the forested areas, 54․7%, have small: 0․4-0․5,41․5%, medium: 0․6-0․7 և 3․8%, high: 0 ․ 8-1․0 completeness.
 The large number of small trees indicates that most of the forests of the republic are in poor condition due to their environmental and economic properties.
  The same picture is observed in productivity indicators, where IV, V, V a, V b, low productivity bonite classes make up 53-1%, while high productive I, II bonite classes make only 10%.
Armenia is one of the 70 countries in the world, whose forest area makes up 10% of the total area.
  In recent decades, the loss of forests is mainly due to deforestation for the purchase of construction timber and firewood.
Illegal deforestation is 10 times more than allowed.
  Although the state allows to cut 30-40 thousand m3 of timber, but 300-400 thousand m3 is cut.
 The dynamics of illegal logging for 2009-2017 is presented in Figure 4.
2004 Although the government has approved forest strategies and policies, such as the Forest Code, the condition of forests is not improving.
  There are many shortcomings. Funding for the forest sector has decreased, there is a problem of foresters.
As a result of deforestation, the ecosystem and the Ukrainian environment are being disrupted.

Figure 4. Number of illegally felled trees found in the "Forestry" branches of "Hayantar" SNCO, in specially protected areas, in areas of general use outside the forest system, inspections of organizations [1, in CIS countries, if the green area per capita is 2 9 hectares, then with us - 0.1 hectares, that is, 29 times less.
  The fact that Armenia is one of the least forested countries is confirmed by the "Hayantar" SNCO.
  For Armenia to be a state, 5,000 hectares of trees must be planted annually, while the existing trees are cut down for mining by the government.
In the forests of the Republic of Armenia, forest pathological researches, reforestation and afforestation works are carried out.
  The purpose of forest pathology studies is to clarify the patterns of pests and diseases, to develop and implement projects for effective pest prevention measures.
 Through forest pathological studies, the sanitary condition of forests is assessed, the need for sick, dry cuttings is determined, and their volumes.
The number of sanitary-dried trees, yes
Figure 5. 2008-2017. Dynamics of reforestation / ha / [1, 2] Reforestation works are carried out in order to ensure natural restoration of burnt areas of the forest lands, untouched by other negative factors, restoration of formerly forested areas.
Afforestation is the establishment and cultivation of artificial forest crops by planting on non-forested lands, as well as on lands of special purpose.
The dynamics of afforestation (2008-2012) and reforestation (2008-2017) in the territory of the Republic of Armenia are given in Figure 5-6.
Yes
Figure 6. 2008-2012. Dynamics of afforestation / ha / [1, 2] As can be seen from the data in Figure 5 և 6, the afforestation and reforestation works in the forests of Armenia are very satisfactory, it is necessary to carry out additional works in parallel with the reduction of illegal deforestation.
In the field of forest protection, it is necessary to take a number of measures, such as legislative and institutional reforms, improvement of the control system, change of consumer attitude towards nature, promotion of the use of alternative energy, etc.
As long as the population does not change its consumer attitude towards forests, in general, as long as the forest is seen as a means of obtaining timber and firewood, there is no awareness of the importance of forests as an ecosystem.
  It is necessary to increase the level of ecological education of the society, to include in school curricula materials on ecological and rational nature use, to introduce the population to the benefits of ecosystem services.
In the field of rational use of natural resources of the Republic of Armenia, taking into account the successful experience of developed countries, it is necessary to make appropriate changes by introducing the latest technologies.
 For this purpose it is necessary to acquire և apply: detection of legal և illegal activities ագր mapping, o application of three-zone (satellite imagery acquisition), drones, o rapid response և rapid transport equipment, o "GIS" system GPS GPS o Photo cards, photocopiers, o sensor systems, etc.
Taking into account the fact that the forests of the Republic of Armenia are mountainous, have a protective significance, and the demand for timber exceeds the productivity of forests several times, it is necessary for the forest-social-economic-ecological significance.
  In order to increase the effectiveness of the work on combating illegal logging, it is necessary to carry out the following activities in parallel: Use of economic levers to promote timber import, introduction of e-services և development.
