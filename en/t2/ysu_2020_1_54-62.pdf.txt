Referring to these indicators, showing the role of tourism in the world now, we can not but refer to its place and dermis in our region, particularly in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia.
According to the analytical data of the Tourism Competitiveness Report, Georgia is in the first place in the region in terms of competitiveness, which is in the 70th place, համեմատ, compared to the previous year, improved its position by 3.70 points (+1 in terms of competitiveness), then Azerbaijan - in the 71st place. - + 3.70 points (in the range of competitiveness - + 13), Armenia - in the 84th place, growth - +3.53 points (in the range of competitiveness - + 5) [1].
In recent years, tourism in this region has been growing steadily, as evidenced by the graph of changes in the number of tourist visits (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Number of international tourist arrivals in Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, people. In all three countries there has been an increase in the number of tourists, which, of course, has contributed to the economic development of those countries, improving their position in international tourism. In other words, it contributes to the rise of these countries in the international arena, or, on the contrary, in Azerbaijan, along with growth, it has nevertheless registered a decline of 4 positions.
 To present the situation in more detail, let us mention that in 2010 about 687 thousand tourists visited Armenia, Azerbaijan - 1.280 million, Georgia - 1.067 million.
  In 2017, the number of tourists in Armenia amounted to 1.495 million, in Azerbaijan - 2.454 million, in Georgia - 3.479 million.
  According to the data, the highest increase in the number of tourists was registered in Georgia, the number of tourists more than tripled, while in Armenia and Azerbaijan, during the observed period, they only doubled.
 Georgia, in general, is a country, say experts, where there are high, very high և fantastic season seasons, not only because it is more attractive or has more favorable conditions for tourism.
 No, it is simply a secret that in the tourism advertising market, which presupposes the appearance at various international exhibitions.
  Georgia is everywhere.
 In the trio of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, tourists should at least get to know Armenia.
The Government of the Republic of Armenia annually provides the equivalent of about 200 thousand US dollars for the development of one of the branches, the most profitable tourism of the Economy.
 This sentence could be considered the end of the discussion, for the simple reason that only two times more is needed to properly represent the country in the external advertising and information platform, because, as Lord Thomas Macaulay used to repeat in the 19th century, "Make money without advertising" The printing house of a single coin is able to spend money. ”
It is also a fact that Armenia is not justly inferior to the neighboring countries in terms of attractiveness and tourism potential, that there has been an increase in the flow of tourists in recent years.
  However, at the same time, it is a fact that Armenia is still in the 70th place in the world tourism մրց travel competition report, yielding to the neighboring countries, Azerbaijan and Georgia, with a slight difference, with significant progress compared to previous years.
  It is a fact that tourism experts unanimously claim that no matter what the statistics on tourism flows are, "Armenia is not one of the first violinists in the tourism market" [3].
Tourism is considered a labor-intensive sector, which, directly or indirectly, contributes to reducing unemployment and overcoming poverty.
 Due to all this, tourism, developing, including for the countries of the region, has acquired a pronounced socio-economic significance.
It is noteworthy that the policy of state regulation of the sphere plays a decisive role in the process of tourism development of the Republic of Armenia. It is not surprising that in 2003 According to the RA Law on Tourism, the sphere has been declared a priority branch of the economy [4].
The following chart shows the changes in the volume and movement of financial revenues received from tourism in the three countries of the region.
Armenia:
Azerbaijan
Georgia
Figure 2. International tourism inflows in the three countries of the region, million as shown in the chart, in all three countries there was an increase in financial revenues from the tourism sector, but in each of the three countries different rates were recorded.
  In Armenia, about $ 646 million was received from the tourism sector in 2010, which gradually increased as a result of the development of the sector, as well as the increase in tourism flows, in 2016 amounted to $ 968 million, and in 2017 exceeded 1 billion. and amounted to $ 1.120 million.
  The picture is completely changing in Azerbaijan. Here, if the financial revenues from the tourism sector in 2010 amounted to 657 million dollars, in 2016 those revenues exceeded 2 billion, amounting to about 2.714 million, and a year later in 2017 - 3.012 million dollars.
 The situation in Georgia is completely different.
2010 Revenues from the tourism sector in this country amounted to 659 million dollars, in 2016 - 2.166 million, and in 2017 - 2.751 million dollars.
For comparison, if in 2017 Azerbaijan visited 2.454 million tourists, it received $ 3.012 million in that year, then in 2017 it visited 3.479 million tourists in Georgia, received only $ 2.751 million.
  In the same year, 1.495 million tourists visited Armenia and received $ 1.120 million.
  It turns out that the income of one tourist in Armenia is 749 dollars, in Georgia - 791 dollars, in Azerbaijan - 1227 dollars.
This is mainly due to the fact that the prices offered in the tourism sector in Georgia are more affordable than in Azerbaijan.
According to a report by the United Nations World Tourism Organization, Georgia is one of the fastest growing countries in the world in terms of tourism development, ranking fourth in the world and second in Europe.
To get a more complete picture of tourism development in the regions, let's calculate the number of tourists per capita (the ratio of the number of tourists visiting the country in 2017 և the ratio of population) բնակ the financial income per capita from tourism (the volume of financial inflows from tourism in 2017) population ratio).
  Based on those calculations, we got the following picture.
Armenia:
Azerbaijan
Georgia
Figure 3. Number of tourist arrivals per capita in the three countries of the region (tourist) It is clear from the study of Figure 3 that in 2017 According to the data, there is 0.5 per capita in Armenia, only 0.25 in Azerbaijan (half less than in Armenia), and 0.94 in Georgia.
  It is predicted that in the coming years more tourists will visit Georgia than its population.
    According to this index, Georgia registered the best, then Armenia - half of its population, and only Azerbaijan - a quarter of its population.
In the above three countries in 2017. The calculations of tourism revenues per capita give an interesting picture.
Armenia:
Azerbaijan
Georgia
Figure 4. Inflows from tourism per capita in dollars. From the study of the chart, we see that in 2017, each resident of Armenia received $ 383 inputs from inbound tourism, Azerbaijan - $ 304, and Georgia - $ 740.
  Georgia received the most per capita inflows from these three countries, twice as much as the other two neighboring countries.
  Armenia is in the second place with not much difference, only Azerbaijan.
Thus, summarizing the mentioned analysis, we can clearly state that in all three countries of the region, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, tourism has registered tendencies of sustainable development in recent years.
  Those whose number of tourists has increased, the financial incomes received from tourism have increased.
  According to various analytical indicators, one of the three countries was in the lead in different years, for example, Armenia was the first in terms of the minimum expenditure per tourist, Azerbaijan in absolute terms of financial inflows from tourism, the number of tourists per capita, per capita inflows per capita. Georgia, however, in all the above-mentioned countries, positive developments in the field of tourism are an undeniable reality.
