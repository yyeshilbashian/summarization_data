 With this in mind, the aim of this work is to identify and analyze the dynamics of changes in extremely high values ​​of temperature (absolute maximum temperatures) of the studied area և to assess their impact on the surrounding natural environment.
The work revealed, analyzed the peculiarities of the formation of extremely high (absolute maximum) air temperature indicators in the Lake Sanaa basin, the dynamics of change, analyzed the impact of climate change on the natural environment of the region, clarified the existing problems.
  The vulnerability of the study area to global climate change was discussed, and ways to mitigate the negative effects of climate change were developed.
Methodology ․ In order to solve the set problems, the work was served as a theoretical-informational basis: relevant studies, printed works, decisions of the Government of the Republic of Armenia, reports, development programs, projects, work plans, reports.
 The factual data of the multi-year observations of atmospheric precipitation of the meteorological stations of the MES hydrometric service of the studied area (1966-2016), as well as the climatic bulletins were used as a starting point in the work.
  Mathematical-statistical, extraction, analysis, correlation methods were used as methodological basis in the work.
The study area is located in Gegharkunik region.
  It is bordered on the east by Aregun, Shan, Arjelyan Sang, on the south by Vardenis, on the west by Geghama-Pambak mountain ranges.
  The length is 120 km, the width is 30-80 km, the distance is 4891 km2.
The lake basin extends in the range of 1900-3500 m.
The maximum area is 2000-2800 m, the average height of the basin is 2390 m [2].
Results և talk ․ The issues of air temperature change were discussed in the work և studied according to the results of actual observations of meteorological stations (Figure 1).

YearTable 1. Monthly average annual air temperature values ​​(ºC) Analyzing the data in Table 1, ie monthly average annual air temperature values, we understand that the highest value was recorded in Shorzha (+6․4 ºC) and the lowest in the Trinity (- 2․3 ºC).
As a rule, the formation of air temperature is influenced by a number of physical-geographical factors, such as the geographical position, the general circulation of the atmosphere, the relief, the direction of the mountain ranges, the orientation and the slope.
 The area under study under the combined influence of the mentioned factors is distinguished by a large temperature variety (Table 1 և 2).
  In general, the absolute maximum air temperature decreases as the absolute altitude of the place increases.

Shan Lake Table 2. Observed absolute maximum air temperature (ºC) [2] Observed absolute maximum temperature (Table 2), studying the data we understand that +34 ºC was recorded in Martuni, Masrik, Gavar և Shorzha, ie these are the highest values ​​in 2011. The lowest value for the same year was + 23ºC registered in the Quarterly.
The Areguni mountain range stretches in the northern part of the study area, the Shan mountain range in the northeastern part, and the Shanil mountain range in the eastern part, which is a link between the Sang and Vardenis mountain ranges.
  If the slopes of Areguni և Sևn mountain ranges overlooking ևan Lake are steep, then the slopes of Geghama և Vardenis mountain ranges overlooking ևan Lake are relatively gentle.
  Here, in addition to the volcanic mountain slopes, lava erupted out of the numerous volcanic cones of the mountains and caused ravines and boulders.
  It is in these parts, in the areas between Geghama, Vardenis mountain ranges and Lake Sana, that there are significant areas that are suitable for agriculture.
 They are especially the valleys of Masrik, Argitchi rivers and Gavaraget.
  The relatively large of them is the Masrik field.
 These flat areas are 1900-2200 m above sea level.
  The study area has a temperate climate with well-defined mountainous zoning.
  The climate of the coastal zone of Sana (up to 2100 m, 2-12 km) is relatively mild.
 At altitudes of 2100-3000 m we meet the climate of short summers and cold winters.
 The maximum air temperature is observed in July-August, and the minimum in January-February.
In the lowland coastal regions, the average annual air temperature is 4․0 ... 6․0 ºC, which, however, due to microclimatic conditions, is marked by variegation.
 Thus, in Masrik (1940 m) 40 Martuni (1945 m) meteorological stations, which have almost the same absolute height, the average annual temperature is 4.5 և 6.1 ºC, respectively.
The average annual temperature is higher at the foot of the lake on the slopes of the Aregun և Sjan mountain range.
  Thus, in Shorzha, which is 1922 m above sea level, the average annual temperature is 6.4 ºC.
 However, as for the absolute maximum air temperatures, it should be noted that almost all meteorological stations in the coastal zone have almost the same value - 32-34 ºC.
The alpine meadows of the region are characterized by a long cold mountainous climate with a stable snow cover.
  The average temperature in January is -10․0 ... -14․0 ºC, the minimum reaches -35․0 ºC (Triplets: 3101 m).
  Summer is cool և short և, in July the average temperature is 10․0 ... 14․0 ºC, the maximum is 23․0 ºC.

Years Figure 3. Dynamics of extremely high values ​​of air temperature Studies show that there is a tendency of increasing extremely high values ​​of air temperature in the region (Figure 3).
Studies show that in the region, particularly in the most economically developed landscape zone, modern all-landscapes have been significantly affected by human productive activities, a significant part of the area has changed radically to become agricultural landscapes.
Statistical analysis of observational series of meteorological stations in Gegharkunik area has shown that the number of annual days with strong heat is significantly increasing.
In this work, the task is to identify and analyze the dynamics of changes in extremely high values ​​(absolute maximum temperatures) of the air temperature of the study area և to assess their impact on the surrounding natural environment.
  As a result of the calculated data, it becomes clear that in 1966-2016 ․ The lowest values ​​of the extremely high air temperature in the Lake Sanaa basin were registered in 2009.
 The average temperature in January is -10 ° С in the lakeside zone, -12 ° С in the watersheds, +16 ° С հ +8 ° С in July, respectively.
The study area is one of the most important areas for the cultivation of agricultural crops, we will not be mistaken if we say that one of the important indicators to determine the level of agriculture is the optimization of field work terms, their adaptation to the weather conditions.
