DIMETHYSULFOXIDE AND DIETHYSULFOXIDE OH
 DETERMINATION OF RATICAL RESPONSIBILITY INSTITUTIONS ON THE BASIS OF COMPETITIVE KINETICS In this work we have studied the dimethylsulfoxide և diethylsulfoxide's diethylsulfoxide.
  The values ​​of the reaction rate constants are obtained.
 The results show that DESO has a greater ability to absorb radicals than DMSO.
The importance of DMSO in various fields of natural sciences, including chemical, biological, medical and geological physics is well known.
 It is used as a solvent not only for organic և even inorganic substances, but also (acts) as a chemical և biological ագ reagent in various systems ․ its solvating և complex-producing property is especially emphasized.
 Of particular interest are its aqueous solutions, due to the specificity of the latter in different biomedical directions.
[3] Work has shown that diethylsulfoxide (DESO) has unique physicochemical properties similar to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and can be used in biomedicine.
  Compared to DESO, DMSO exhibits biologically significant substances with greater ability to form molecular complexes, such as cholesterol, urea, and molecular iodine.
 Because DMSO is less toxic, it has been proposed as a molecular sample for quantitative determination of the detection of hydroxyl radicals in biological systems.
Materials և methods.
 The DESO was obtained և purified in accordance with [5] procedure.
 The purity, which was determined by gas chromatography, more than 99․5 bells. % was.
 Water content after drying 0․01 bell. % was.
 DMSO (99.9% purity) և the pigment was purchased from AldrichChemical Co և used without additional cleaning.
  Mercury lamp was used as a source of UV rays.
 N, N-dimethyl-4-nitroso radical (PNDMA) is a competing substance in the process of radical oxidation.

Study of the properties of interaction և The competitive kinetic approach is given in [6-8].
 According to this approach, radicals are obtained by photolysis of H2O2 by irradiation with a length of λ = 313 nm.
 Spectrophotometric measurements at 400-800 rpm were performed using a Specord 50PC spectrophotometer.
Results և their discussion ․ Reactions can be schematically illustrated as follows: where P is the material being studied (DMSO, DESO).
 The change in PNDMA concentration was studied photometrically (
).
 Measurements were made in L. According to Beer's law, [PNDMA] = f (t) in the linear domain of dependence.
 The pH of the reaction medium is kept constant.
The graphs D = f (t) were constructed based on the obtained results.
The latter were determined for different concentrations of DMSO և DESO.
Then the tgs of the curves are calculated from them, which are directly proportional to the velocities.

 Radical reaction rate constants are as follows [7, 9]: kOH + P = 1.25.1010 ([PNDMA] / [P]). [(W1 / W2) -1], mol-1 sec-1 where [P] is the initial concentration of the test substance (usually 10-510-3 mol / l), is the reaction rate constant (kOH), W1 և W2 in the absence of the material to be examined accordingly ությունները The velocities of the reactions in the presence of W2, and the velocity corresponding to the breaking point.
, 1.25.1010 According to the experimental data, the reaction rate constants for DMSO և DESO have the following values: kOH + DESO = 7.5x109 mol-1.l.-sec, kOH + DMSO = 4.2x109 mol-1.l. sec -1.
  DMSO data coincide with literary data.
  DESO has OH
