FEATURES OF EXTREME TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION AND MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS IN THE ARARAT COMMUNITY TREATY Knowledge of the patterns of spatial-temporal distribution of extreme air temperatures is necessary for the development of the region's economy, particularly agriculture.
  In general, the study of air temperature can be used not only to clarify various branches of the economy, but also various hydrological problems that are of practical importance.
Air temperature is a characteristic of one of the links of the climate system, the atmosphere.
 The role of air temperature is great in the formation, evaporation, formation and elimination of ice phenomena, heat-humidity circulation, as well as in the processes of frost, drought and desertification.
  The role of the temperature regime in the formation of water consumption of agricultural crops and crop formation is exceptionally important.
Therefore, the aim of this work is to discuss, to identify the patterns of spatial distribution of extreme air temperature values ​​(absolute minimum և absolute maximum), the dynamics of their change, the problems of aftermath management.
Material և Methodology ․ Relevant scientific-research studies [1-2, 4-6] were the theoretical basis for the solution of the set problems [1-2, 4-6].
 The results of the observations of the MES hydrometric service were used as a starting material.
The Ararat depression, which forms the northwestern part of the Middle Araks Depression, which is a typical physical-geographical region with its unique natural processes.
 With ridged ridges and plateaus, the concavity is an isolated bowl 2.5–3.0 km deep, which is influenced by the climate of the region, mainly the water-heating regime, [3].
Geographical, general scientific, description, statistical, analysis, correlation methods were used in the work.
Results և Discussion ․ The formation of air temperature in any place is influenced by a number of physical-geographical factors, the most important of which are latitude, general atmospheric circulation, relief nature, mountain range positions and directions, slope orientations and slopes.
 Therefore, despite the small space it occupies, the concave is distinguished by a great variety of thermal regimes.
 The effect of terrain on air temperature is especially pronounced during the cold months.
During the year a well-expressed course of absolute maximum և minimum values ​​of air temperature is observed (Fig. 1).
  Thus, one maximum և one minimum temperature values ​​are observed in the studied area during the year.
 The maximum values ​​are usually observed in July, and the minimum values ​​in January.
  However, the lowest temperatures of some years can be observed in February or December.
 Sometimes there may be years when equal air temperature values ​​are recorded between July and August, or the maximum values ​​during the year are recorded in August.
 In the study area, during the year, the extreme monthly values ​​of air temperature increase sharply from March, the absolute maximum temperature, and from April, the absolute minimum temperature.
One of the peculiarities of the annual course of air temperature both in the republic and in the studied area is that the autumn months are warmer than the spring months, from October to April, from September to May.
  This refers not only to the average temperature values, but also to the extreme values, which is clarified in Fig. From 1.
  The reason for that is the presence of snow in the mountains during the spring months and the great cloudiness և the maximum amount of annual precipitation, as a result of which the active surface և the air is not heated enough.
  Cloudiness is low in September, the number of rainy days is higher, the amount of precipitation is less than in August.

The absolute minimum air temperature in the study area changes -21.0 ...- 33.6 ºC, and the absolute maximum temperature - 21.0 ... 42.6 ºC.
 It turns out that in contrast to the absolute minimum air temperature, the absolute maximum air temperature fluctuates over a wider range.
  The reason is that the distribution of air temperature during the winter months is essentially conditioned by the effect of the relief;
  As a result, the absolute minimum values ​​of air temperature and altitude are leveled.
It should be noted that the hottest year of the republic (above the norm - 2.9ºC) was 2010, and the second warmest year (above the norm - 2.0 ºC) - 1998.
 2011 43.7 ºC was registered in Meghri on July 31, 2010, which is the absolute maximum temperature of the Republic of Armenia.
It is 0.7 ºC higher than the absolute maximum value of the previous air temperature [1, 4].
In general, the absolute maximum air temperature decreases as the absolute altitude of the place increases (Fig. 2).
According to the altitude, the absolute minimum air temperature changes with the following pattern.
 Thus, up to the heights of 1200-1300 m, the absolute minimum temperature of the air is observed within the concavity, and on the contrary, at altitudes higher than 1300 m, on the contrary.

 It is relatively weak for the absolute minimum air temperature up to 1200-1300 m.
  The annual value of the vertical temperature extreme gradient within the concavity is 1.680C / 100m for absolute maximum temperature, -3,220C / 100m for absolute minimum temperature (up to 1200-1300m) և 1,100C / 100m (more than 1300m) heights).

  It makes it possible to estimate the thermal regime of unexplored և little studied areas ելու to compile spatial distribution maps.
The work studies the dynamics of changes in air temperature extremes for Yerevan "agro" և Aragats b / l meteorological stations.
  As a result of the studies, it was found out that according to the data of Yerevan "agro", there is a tendency of increasing the absolute maximum annual values ​​of air temperature in the concavity area, a tendency of decreasing the absolute minimum annual values.
 According to the data of Aragats b / l meteorological station, there is only a tendency of increasing the annual extreme values ​​of air temperature.
Conclusions և Suggestions ․ As a result of the studies, we came to the following conclusions: a well-expressed annual trend of extreme air temperature values ​​is observed in the studied area, - like other meteorological elements, the air temperature changes in horizontal, upward directions.
  The spatial distribution of air temperature in mountainous countries is subject to the laws of upward zoning - the absolute maximum air temperature decreases with increasing absolute altitude within the concavity, the absolute minimum air temperature rises to 1200-1300 m, and vice versa at altitudes higher than 1300 m. decreases, - close correlations are obtained between the values ​​of the absolute altitude տեղի extreme air temperature և, - the annual value of the vertical temperature extreme gradient within the concavity is 1.68 0C / 100 m for the absolute maximum color temperature, for the absolute minimum temperature: - 3.22 0C / 100 m (up to 1200-1300 m) և 1.10 0C / 100 m (altitudes above 1300 m);- There is a tendency to increase the extreme values ​​of air temperature in the study area for many years.
According to this, it is necessary ․ - Providing comprehensive, systematic and continuous monitoring; - Maintaining, monitoring, strengthening, expanding and improving the climate monitoring network, system;
