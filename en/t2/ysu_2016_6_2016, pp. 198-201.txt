RESPONSE TO CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN ARMENIAN AND TURKISH PRESIDENTS IN ARMENIAN AND TURKISH ONLINE PERIODICES
 On the eve of the centenary, one of the steps taken by Turkey in 2015 to distort history, to deny the past, to divert the attention of the world community. April 24 was designated as the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Canakkale (or Gallipoli).
It should be noted that the Gallipoli battles started on March 18, 1915 and continued until 1916. The Allied operation to oust the Gallipoli ground battles began on April 25 1.
  It is obvious from the mentioned historical facts that this step has an obvious anti-Armenian tendency, it is to divert the attention of the generality of the genocide denial policy.
2015 After a meeting with Azerbaijani President Ilham Ali on January 15, 2010, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said at a joint press conference that a number of events dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Canakkale would be held on April 24, attended by his "brother" Ali.
 He noted that invitations to participate in the events will be sent to the presidents, prime ministers and high-ranking officials of more than 100 countries.
One of the invitation letters was quite remarkable. It turned out that RA President Serzh Sargsyan was on the guest list.
  In fact, with this invitation, which the RA President later described as "cynical, short-sighted", and the Turkish press as "diplomatic", the Turkish President rejected Serzh Sargsyan's invitation to participate in events dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide and commemoration of innocent victims.
 Meanwhile, in 2014 During the inauguration ceremony of the newly elected President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the Turkish Presidential Palace on August 28, 2010, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Armenia Edward Nalbandian conveyed the official invitation of the President of the Republic of Armenia to the President of Turkey2.
Responding to the invitation of the Turkish President, the Armenian President sent a reply on January 16, calling on Turkey to recognize and condemn the Armenian Genocide, adding that "it is the duty of each of us to pass on the history of distortion, thus preventing the recurrence of atrocities and paving the way for nations." especially for the rapprochement and further cooperation between the neighboring nations. "
 Serzh Sargsyan states as a postscript (PS) at the end of the letter. "It is not customary for us to host the guest without receiving the answer of our own invitation" 3.
The mutual correspondence of the presidents of Armenia and Turkey, in addition to being interesting in itself, is also covered with interesting accents in the Armenian-Turkish press.
Almost all Armenian online news periodicals spread the press release of the RA Foreign Ministry that Edward Nalbandian handed Erdogan Serzh Sargsyan's official invitation.
 It is interesting that the Armenian online periodicals, which were still actively discussing and criticizing Sargsyan's "football diplomacy", avoided giving positive or negative assessments to this step.
 Only a few of them published the opinions of Turkologists, where they simply expressed hope that Erdogan would not accept the invitation4.

Armenian online periodicals simply presented analyzes of the expected interests.
  Only in 2014 On December 15, Armenpress news agency published an interview with Ara Gochunyan, editor-in-chief of the Armenian "Zhamanak" periodical published in Istanbul, who considered the president's invitation a "considered and forward-looking" step.
The first Turkish online periodical to respond to this invitation was the opposition "Jihan" news agency, which "refrained from giving any assessment" 2.
 In connection with the invitation, there were comments in the publications of other Turkish online periodicals, which were mostly published in the headlines and headlines.
  For example, the publication of "Kanalb.com.tr" was titled "Surprise of" 1915 made from Sargsyan to Turkey "3, the publication of" Milliyet "was titled" Interesting invitation from Armenia to Turkey "4," Yenieksen.com " "Armenia's shock invitation to Turkey" 5, "Haber7.com" "Armenia invitation invitation" 6, etc.
It is noteworthy that in the publications of both pro-government and opposition online periodicals, in addition to the information about the invitation of the President of the Republic of Armenia, there were also Erdogan's condolence message։ various allegations about the massacre of 300-400 thousand Turks by Armenians in the early 20th century.
On January 15, following the Turkish President's announcement, Armenian online periodicals, with great operative reference to the Turkish Hurriyet 7 and Milliyet 8, reported that the Turkish President would invite Serzh Sargsyan to Turkey with the leaders of 102 countries, noting: that the Armenians also fought in that battle9.
In the following days, the Armenian online periodicals already presented analytical publications on this topic.
  This move by Turkey is described by some Armenian news sites as "to put it mildly, a provocation" 10, "cynicism and arrogance" 11 as a "response in the form of denial" 12.
  "Zham.am" from online magazines describes this step as a "mockery". "When you are ridiculed, the problem is most likely with you."
Some of the websites published opinions according to which this step was taken "to divert attention from the events dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide" 14.
 "Yerevannews.am" և "Erkir.am", referring to "Agos", published the opinions of several representatives of the Armenian community, who describe Erdogan's invitation as a "shameless step" and a "mockery" 15.
"Azatutyun.am" և "Tert.am" online periodicals also presented "The Independent" reflection on this topic, where the author Robert Fisk, referring to Erdogan's invitation, wrote: "This is not just a diplomatic prank.
  The Turks, naturally, are afraid that 1915 will be mentioned as the year of their horrible crimes against humanity during the extermination of the Armenians. ”16
  "Arka.am" also presents the interview of the RA President to "France24", where Sargsyan described Erdogan's invitation as "cynical" 17.
Most of the Turkish media consider Erdoողan's initiative a "historic" and "diplomatic" step.

http:
//www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/the-gallipoli-centenary-is-a-shameful-attempt-to-hide-the news sites condemned Erdogan's move.
 For example, Radikal.com.tr columnist Baskin Oran writes in one of his publications: "Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan is invited to Canakkale on April 24.
 What does it mean.
 What a shame, what a sin it is. ”1
In one of the publications of the Turkish "T24", which was also presented by the Armenian "168.am", the co-chair of the pro-Kurdish "People's Democratic Party" Selahattin Demirtash described Recep Tayyip Erdogan's initiative as a shameful step. "In response to 1915 This initiative of the government on the 100th anniversary of the events is shameful. ”2
  According to Aydintashbash, a columnist for the Turkish "Milliyet". "By sending a letter to Armenia on April 24, they do not say, 'Welcome to Canakkale.'
 This can only be a bad joke. ”3
Serzh Sargsyan's reply letter to Erdogan was published in full in almost all Armenian online periodicals, accompanied by analytical materials.
 Some news sites, speaking about Serzh Sargsyan's reply letter, describe it as "correct, accurate, within the bounds of diplomatic ethics" 4, but there is also the view "Serzh Sargsyan, if he had not just noticed that invitation, everything would have fallen into place" 5.
More than 20 Turkish online periodicals presented the reply letter of the President of the Republic of Armenia with reductions, mainly the beginning և end of the reply letter.
  In other words, the Turkish reader did not have a complete idea about the answer of the RA President.
 Only three opposition periodicals presented the answer in full or almost in full 6.
  The Turkish online periodicals focused on the summary of the reply letter, where Sargsyan mentioned that he was the first to send an invitation a few months ago.
 This emphasis was especially evident in the form of the titles of the publications.
  For example, the publication of the opposition "Haberahval" includes almost the entire content of the reply letter of the RA President և has the headline "Armenia's response: let him come first" 7, "Milliyet" headlined the publication "We do not visit without receiving the answer" 8, " "Gercekgundem", presenting the reply letter, titled the publication "Sargsyan's sharp response to Erdogan" 9.
Later, Turkish online periodicals also published a response to a letter from Sargsyan's spokesman նախագահ Sargsyan և to the Turkish Foreign Ministry, Anadolu news agency, stating that "Serzh Sargsyan's remarks on the invitation sent by the President of Turkey to Armenia are inadmissible, they contradict diplomatic to the practice ”10.
 The very contradictory comments of the Turkish citizens were interesting, from the manifestations of aggression and hysteria to analytical opinions.
Turkey's step in 2015 The designation of April 24 as the day of the celebration of the centennial victory of the Battle of Canakkale (or Gallipoli) once again proves the anti-Armenian denial position of the Turkish authorities.
Thus, studying the reactions to the correspondence between the presidents of Armenia and Turkey in the online press, it can be stated that the Armenian online periodicals generally avoided giving assessments, did not present objective, comprehensive, orienting analyzes to the society.
 The news sites (mainly opposition), which published critical materials about Serzh Sargsyan's invitation and response letter, did not mention what negative consequences it could have for Armenia.
Speaking about Erdogan's invitation, the pro-government, opposition, relatively neutral online periodicals did not show significant differences in their publications. All of them described it as another anti-Armenian step.

Examining the reactions in the Turkish online press, it can be noted that if Serzh Sargsyan's invitation was shocking for both the opposition and the government online periodicals, their reactions were almost the same, then the differences in the reactions to Erdogan's invitation և in Sargsyan's response letter become obvious.
 It should also be noted that, nevertheless, the opposition online periodicals also did not present comprehensive, objective publications.
 If, for example, there was criticism of Erdogan's invitation, then in the same periodical various allegations were made about the massacre of 300-400 thousand Turks by Armenians at the beginning of the 20th century.
For comparison, let the Armenian online periodicals refer to the publications in the Turkish online periodicals, while the Turkish online press did not refer to any Armenian online periodicals.
It can be concluded that for the online periodicals of both countries, the correspondence of the presidents was another opportunity to secure a rating, to discuss the steps of the government, to find an opportunity to talk about the tense relations between the two countries, to review the past pages, to present the views of the international community.
