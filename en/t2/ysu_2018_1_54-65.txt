POPULATION AGE STRUCTURE FEATURES AND EXISTING PROBLEMS HIGHER AND HIGHLAND MOUNTAIN RURAL SETTLEMENTS.
  In our country, which has limited territorial resources, the balanced development of such regions ամր the strengthening of existing settlements in them is vital, as mountainous-high mountainous regions (above 1700 m above sea level) occupy more than 60% of the RA land area, in those regions are located 13 urban areas. 344 rural settlements.
 2016 As of the beginning of the year, 17% of the country's population (8% of the urban population and 34% of the rural population) accounted for the mountainous and high mountainous areas of the Republic of Armenia [1].
Problem և The purpose of the research.
 Rural areas and settlements have a special place in the development of the economy of the mountainous and high mountainous regions of the Republic of Armenia.
 More than 36% of the RA rural settlements are located in such regions.
  The efficiency of the use of the territorial resources and agricultural lands of the highlands of the Republic of Armenia և economic progress together with other factors depends on the effective use of the existing human potential ալ on optimal management.
 Therefore, the study of one of the main components of the demographic situation of such areas, the age structure of the rural population, is extremely relevant; it has not only scientific but also practical significance.
 The aim of the research is to reveal the peculiarities of the age structure (according to the main age groups) of the population of the mountainous-high mountainous rural settlements of the Republic of Armenia, territorial differences, existing problems, pointing out the solutions.
Research materials և methods.
 The research was based on the NSS statistical data on the distribution of the current population of the main population in 344 mountainous-high mountainous rural settlements of the Republic of Armenia.
 The mentioned data was analyzed, summarized and generalized.
  Statistical, comparative-geographical-cartographic research methods were used in the work.
Research results և discussion.
 Due to the socio-political, socio-economic processes that have taken place in the Republic of Armenia during the last more than two and a half decades, the geopolitical situation in our region has created an extremely tense demographic situation in the country.
 Only in 2001-2016. The de jure population of the republic decreased by 214.4 during the period, and in 1992-2016 by about 635 thousand [2].
 1991 In comparison with 2015, the birth rate in the country decreased by 7.7 ppm (from 21.6 to 13.9 ‰), the mortality rate increased from 6.5 to 9.3 [[2].
  1991 Compared to the previous year, the coefficient of natural increase of the population in the Republic of Armenia has decreased 3.28 times, that is, it has decreased from 15.1 to 4.6 ‰ [2].
 Due to the mentioned processes, the gender-age structure of the RA population has undergone noticeable changes.
  In addition, over the past twenty-five years, the share of the pre-working-age population (TBU) in the Republic of Armenia has decreased by 11.8 percentage points, and the share of the working-age population (TBU) has increased by 12.4 percentage points [3].
The above-mentioned changes in the demographic situation of the population during the years of independence are more pronounced in the high-mountainous regions of the Republic of Armenia, particularly in rural areas.
  In such areas և settlements, in addition to the general socio-economic problems typical of the Republic of Armenia, additional difficulties for economic activity are caused by the altitude, fragmentation of the area, temperature conditions, relatively poor development of infrastructure, the fact of being away from the capital, etc.
  "The most characteristic feature of the mountainous regions is the vertical zoning, which in turn determines a number of features of human-economic activity," says Professor G. Avagyan [4].
Out of 344 high-mountainous rural settlements of the republic, 173 are mountainous and 171 are high-mountainous.
 57.1% of the total population falls on high mountainous areas, the rest on mountainous rural areas.
 The average population of rural mountain settlements is 897, and in high mountainous areas - 1209 people.
 There are rural mountainous settlements in other regions besides Armavir, and high mountainous settlements in all regions except Ararat, Armavir, Lori and Tavush regions.

The analysis of the data in Table 2 shows that the percentage averages of the main age groups of the population of the mountainous-high mountainous rural settlements of the Republic of Armenia (0-15 years old - 21.1%, 16-62 years old - 67.7%, 63 years old - 11.2%) The differences between the corresponding averages (20.5, 67.9 և 11.6% [3]) are not large.
 However, in the case of regions, there are some differences in these indicators (see Table 2 for details).
  In Vayots Dzor, Shirak, Syunik and Lori marzes the share of 0-15-year-old rural population is lower than the national average of the population of mountainous, high-mountainous rural settlements.
 This difference is more obvious in the high mountainous areas of Syunik, Shirak, and in mountainous rural settlements in Gegharkunik, Vayots Dzor and Aragatsotn.
It is not difficult to notice that the mentioned regions in the Republic of Armenia are distinguished not only by their geographical position, distance from the capital, territorial division, but also by more acute socio-economic development problems.
 All this has an impact on the age structure of the population of the mentioned regions, in particular, mountainous, high-mountainous rural settlements.
Gegharkunik stands out from the regions with high mountainous areas of the Republic of Armenia with the most favorable situation of the age structure of the rural population.
  Here, the share of the pre-able-bodied (0-15 years old) age group of the rural population is higher than the corresponding average of the RA mountainous and high mountainous regions.
 Besides, the share of the rural population above the working age is one of the lowest in Armenia (10.4%).
  Kotayk marz has an almost similar picture of the age structure of the rural population in the mountainous and high mountainous areas, that the population of the villages here is significantly less than Gegharkunik (see Table 2).
19 mountain-high mountain villages of Vayots Dzor region have the most unfavorable situation of the age structure of the rural population.
 The share of the disabled population in them is 4.1 percentage points lower than the average of the mountainous-high mountainous rural settlements of the Republic of Armenia, and the share of the working age group is 2.4 percentage points higher than the average of the Republic of Armenia (see Table 2).

Table 3. Distribution of the population of mountainous rural settlements of the RA marzes by main age groups (2015) Syunikimarz stands out with the unfavorable situation of the age structure of the population of mountainous-high mountainous rural settlements.
 Here, in 38 similar villages with more than 16,000 inhabitants, the share of 0-15 year olds is equal to the average of the total population of the Republic of Armenia, but the share of the working age population is 3.2 percentage points higher than the average of the mountainous, high mountainous rural population.
 The Aragatsotn region is also worth noting.
 The share of the pre-working age population in 64 mountainous-highland villages is 0.7 percentage points higher than the average population of the mountainous-mountainous rural areas of the Republic of Armenia, which is primarily explained by the presence of the Yezidi population in the national population (the latter are distinguished by a relatively high birth rate). .
 However, the share of the able-bodied population is 1.8 percentage points higher (3.2 in high mountainous rural areas) than the average.
  6 mountain villages of Ararat region stand out with a high share of the adult population (see Table 3).
 Here the share of the working age population is the lowest in the mountainous rural settlements of the Republic of Armenia.

Table 4. Distribution of the population of high mountainous rural settlements of the RA marzes by main age groups (2015) The study shows that the distribution of the population among the main age groups in the mountainous and high mountainous rural settlements of the RA has a certain dependence on the population of the settlement.
 In 109 mountain villages with up to 1000 inhabitants, the share of the pre-able-bodied population is smaller than the average for this age group, and the share of the post-able-bodied population is large (see Table 5).
The villages are crowded

Distribution of rural population in the mountainous areas of RA by population density հիմնական age main groups (2015) More 64 mountain villages with a population of up to 200 with a population of about 7,000 are considered vulnerable (Table 5 և 6).
 The average number in those villages is 109 people.
 Due to the similar distribution of the population among the main age groups, such villages become aging, "at risk of deprivation".
In order to make the research more complete, on the basis of different combinations of the main age groups of the population of the mountainous and high mountainous rural settlements of the Republic of Armenia, we have separated rural groups, which differ from each other in the current structure of the main age groups, demographic situation and socio-economic development opportunities.
 Such grouping is based on the comparison of the main age groups of the population of separate settlements with the corresponding average indicators of the Republic of Armenia.
 Such an approach is justified by the fact that in any country (settlement) the final result of demographic processes forms a certain picture of the age structure of the population, which determines the reproduction of the population (birth rate, mortality և natural growth).
 It can be said that the age structure of the population of each settlement is a condensed mirror of the demographic situation, ամ the comparison of the latter with the corresponding average indicators of the Republic of Armenia makes it possible to find out the demographic potential of that settlement (village) [6].

Distribution of RA Highland Rural Population by Settlements in Humanity և Population of the main age groups (2015) Age structure are the villages with demographic situation, in which the proportions of the working age population before working age exceed the corresponding average indicators of the Republic of Armenia (20.5 և 67.9%).
 There are 22 such high mountain villages in Armenia (5 in Aragatsotn, 12 in Gegharkunik, 6 in Kotayk, 6 in Lori, 12 in Shirak).
The second group includes rural settlements with favorable demographic situation and age structure.
 Here, the share of the working age population exceeds the RA average, and the share of the pre-working age population is lower than the corresponding average, but not more than 1.5%.
 This group includes 21 mountainous villages with 15 և high mountains (9 in Aragatsotn, 7 in Shirak, 13 in Gegharkunik, 5 in Lori, 1 in Kotayk, 1 in Syunik).
The third group includes villages with good demographic situation and age structure of the population.
 The share of the pre-able-bodied population in them is higher than the RA average, the working-age age is lower, but not less than 61.7%, and the post-working-age age is not more than 2% higher than the RA average.
 Such are the 22 mountainous և 37 mountainous settlements of the Republic of Armenia (13 in Aragatsotn, 19 in Gegharkunik, 10 in Shirak, 7 in Syunik, 7 in Lori, 4 in Kotayk).
In the fourth group, sufficient demographic situation is the settlements with an age structure of the population.
 The share of the able-bodied population in these villages is higher than the average of the Republic of Armenia, the adult average is not more than 2% higher than the national average, and the age group of 0-15 years old is 14-19%.
 This group is the largest in the number of villages.
 Such highland 42 33 high mountain 33 villages.
 The most such villages are in Shirak (23, and in Aragatsotn and Gegharkunik - 14 each).
The fifth group includes the villages with an unsatisfactory demographic situation and the age structure of the population.
 The share of the pre-working age population in them is more than 1.5% lower than the RA average, the post-working age population is more than 2% higher than the RA average, and the share of the working age population is 61-67.9%.
 This group includes 6 mountainous և 6 high mountain villages.
Figure 1. Classification of mountainous and high mountain villages of the Republic of Armenia according to the main age groups of the population. The sixth group consists of settlements with an age structure of unfavorable demographic situation, in which the share of working age population is higher than the RA average and the working age is less than 14%.
 This group includes 8 mountainous և 8 highland villages.
The last, the seventh group includes the settlements with the most unfavorable demographic situation and age structure of the population.
  The share of the working age population in them is less than 61%.
 Such are 23 mountainous and 28 mountainous villages of the Republic of Armenia (14 in Aragatsotn, 11 in Gegharkunik, 9 in Syunik, 8 in Shirak).
 From this group, some settlements with large disproportions of the age structure of the population are presented in Table 7.

Mountainous և High Mountain Rural Settlements Outstanding in Structure Proportions of the Main Age Groups of the Population The results of the research suggest that the current situation of the age structure of the population of high mountain գյուղ mountainous rural settlements is distinguished by regional differences և.
 In terms of the structure of the main age groups of the population, the most vulnerable are the settlements with a small population (up to 1000 inhabitants), which in the conditions of maintaining նման deterioration of such an age structure may have serious socio-economic problems և face the risk of deprivation և.
One of the most important tasks of the republican, regional and community governing bodies in the coming years should be the implementation of a special regional demographic policy in the mountainous and highland areas of the Republic of Armenia, as it can contribute to improving the socio-economic situation of similar areas and creating a more favorable age structure.
