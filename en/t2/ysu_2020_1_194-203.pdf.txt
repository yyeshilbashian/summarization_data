ON THE FLIGHT CONTROL OF A VARIABLE MACHINE 1. Description of a drone Aircraft are devices designed to fly in the Earth's atmosphere or space.
  Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are called unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
  According to the leadership, they are manageable or unmanageable.
  Managed ATS, in turn, are remotely controlled and automatically controlled.
Fixed drones look like airplanes.
 The following are their main components.
During the forward motion of the ATC, the air flow circulates through the air, which creates a pressure difference at the top and bottom, and the pressure at the bottom is greater than at the top, resulting in a very strong lift force for flight.
  On T are the aerodynamic control organs (electrons) through which the lift is controlled.
Tail "- designed to ensure the stability, control and balance of the ATS.
  Tail-mounted surfaces for ATS control, called aerodynamic steering wheels (height steering, steering wheel).
The chassis is a support system, it is necessary for the run before the flight, as well as for the landing.
The engine creates the necessary traction force for the flight, through which the ATS moves forward.
2. Description of the spatial motion of a drone To coordinate the spatial motion of a drone, we must select coordinate systems [2].
In the OXYZ coordinate system associated with the ATS (hereinafter referred to as) the coordinate axes coincide with the main axes of inertia of the aircraft.
    The OXY plane is the plane of symmetry of the ATS.
  The OX axis is usually parallel to the middle aerodynamic string, pointing from the tail of the aircraft to the nose.
The connected coordinate system is rigidly attached to the flying machine. Its position relative to the normal coordinate system determines the spatial position of the flying machine.
  It is characterized by longitudinal oscillation (tangage), rotation (ryskany), slanting (kren) by Euler angles (Figure 1).
Figure 1. The OXYZ-bound coordinate system նկատմամբ the direction of the angle of inclination with respect to the normal coordinate system is called the angle formed by the projection of the axis OX on the horizontal plane.
  The angle of longitudinal oscillation is called the angle formed by the horizontal plane of the OX axis.
  It is positive if the OX axis is above the horizontal plane.
The angle of inclination is called the angle formed by the orthogonal plane containing the axis OY և.

  For example, for longitudinal oscillation, the longitudinal և transverse driving forces are correspondingly equal: Where: - is the characteristic surface of the steering wheel, q is the velocity pressure, and - is the aerodynamic coefficients of the steering wheel.
Moment characteristics are usually determined by the accuracy of the calculation of the angular velocities of the rotating instruments.
The moments of the ruling forces are equal: There are naval forces.
  Gas forces are the forces generated by an internal combustion engine, which are determined as follows: Where: - is the surface area of ​​the gas steering wheel, - is the density of the gas flow, - is the velocity of the gas flow.
4. Drone Motion Equations The flight of an ATS is carried out by the combustion of fuel, due to which a change in mass takes place.

Using the kinetic moment change theorem, we find the equations of rotational motion of a body of variable mass with respect to an instantaneous system.
Assume that the ATS in the axial-symmetric trajectory coordinate system traces the ազ moments of the aerodynamic force projections and assigns the moments as follows.
forces ող are the influences that control the moments.
In that case, the system of differential equations of motion would look like this: [2] 12.

Highlighting the differential equations of motion of an unmanned aerial vehicle (4.1) In Equation, linearize the system of differential equations.
To do this, consider the desired motion parameters of the aircraft: And their deviations:
In that case we will have: Insert formula (5.1) in (4.1).
  Considering the deviations to be very small, let us take their approximate values ​​for sine և cosine.
  We will get a system of linear equations.
  As an example, consider the linearization of the first equation of (4.1).

 In this case the system of equations will have the following view: Write the equations obtained in the following vector matrix form: Where: In this case the matrices A և B will have the following form: Using Kalman's theorem [5], it is shown that the system is completely controllable.
