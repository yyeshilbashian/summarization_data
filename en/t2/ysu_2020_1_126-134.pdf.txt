THE ROLE OF URBANIZATION IN THE REAL ESTATE MARKET DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVE The real estate market in Armenia is quite unstable. It changes from time to time depending on a number of external and internal factors.
  It is always active, which is an important indicator of the geo-economic situation.
Analyzing the data of 2014-2018 submitted by the State Committee of the Real Estate Cadastre under the Government of the Republic of Armenia և the Committee on National Statistics of the Republic of Armenia, we have obtained a number of interesting results.
 The transactions carried out in the Republic of Armenia will be analyzed according to Yerevan, cities, rural settlements, the results of which are presented in Figure 1.

  In 2018, 162,459 transactions were made in the republic, of which 38.6% were made in rural areas, in Yerevan 36% of the total transactions were made, and in urban areas - 25.3%.
The transactions made in the Republic of Armenia in 2017 և 2018 were analyzed by regions, by types of separate transactions, by types of separate property.
 The following image was obtained (Charts 2, 3 և 4).

Figure 2. Quantitative comparison of transactions made in the Republic of Armenia in 2018 compared to 2017, according to separate transactions among transactions registered in the Republic և (by type of transaction) 2017 և 2018. Comparative analysis shows that compared to 2017, all types of transactions in 2018 (except for primary registration) have an upward trend.
  In 2018, the number of transactions registered in the Republic of Armenia increased by 13.3% compared to 2017, in the city of Yerevan - by 6.7%, in the urban-residential areas of the regions - by 17%, and in rural areas - by 17.7%.
Unlike other charts, Figure 3 shows 2017 և 2018. Quantitative comparison of transactions made in the Republic of Armenia during the year by regions of the city of Yerevan.
  It can be seen from Figure 3 that both in 2017 and in 2018 the incomparably high number of transactions registered in the Republic was observed in the city of Yerevan.
 Yerևnհ follows the regions of Kotayk, then Ararat մ Armavir.
  The similar sequence of regions is conditioned by the presence of the city of Yerevan.
  The lowest number of registered transactions is observed in Vayots Dzorimarz.

Figure 4. Quantitative distribution of transactions in the Republic of Armenia in 2018 by types of property Figure 4 shows that in 2018 the type of most in demand property in the Republic of Armenia is land.
  In general, about 64.5% of land acquisition transactions in the country were carried out in rural areas of the Republic of Armenia, in Yerevan 4.4% was carried out in relation to land, which is due to the high rates of the urban development process in Yerevan.
In terms of demand, the housing market is in the second place.
  About 60% of the transactions with apartments were made in Yerevan.
  Fewer transactions were made for industrial buildings - 2.5% [6].
 In this work, the data of 2014-2018 were developed and analyzed, as a result of which the following image was obtained (Figure 5).

Figure 5. Distribution of general transactions of the Republic during 2014-2018 The real estate market in the Republic during 2014-2018 was in a rather unstable state.
  2014 Compared to 2015 և 2016, the number of transactions in the real estate market has decreased.
 In 2017, a sharp increase in the number of transactions registered in the real estate market was observed.
  Achievement maintained է continuously increased in 2018. in progress.
The number of transactions in the real estate market in the country in 2018 compared to 2014 Compared to the previous year, it increased by about 14%, and in Yerevan - by 21.8%.
According to Pearson, the correlation coefficient was about 82%, and the coefficient of determination was R2 = 0.6798.
 Analyzing Figure 5, we can say that the real estate market of Armenia in 2018 was in a more active state.
Global urbanization presents many opportunities and challenges for real estate investors and managers.
  Advances in technology, demographic and consumer behavior will significantly change the demand for real estate.
  Urbanization does not affect all types of real estate in the same way.
The impact will be strongest in the housing market segment, where the population և structure can lead to significant shifts in demand [2, 3].
Analyzing 2011-2018. The dynamics of the distribution of the de jure population of the Republic of Armenia, according to the data published on the official website of the Statistical Service of the Republic of Armenia, we have obtained the following picture (Figure 6 և 7).

Figure 6. Dynamics of the de jure population of the Republic of Armenia in 2011-2018. 2011 Compared to 2018, the total population of the Republic of Armenia decreased by about 1.5%.
  The negative dynamics of the population in the regions is more pronounced, which is conditioned not only by external but also by internal migration.
  During those years, the population of the RA regional settlements decreased by 4.25%.
  Instead, the share of the permanent population of Yerevan tends to increase throughout the period.
  It proves that the population of the Republic of Armenia is becoming increasingly concentrated in the capital.
  2011 Compared to 2018, the population of Yerevan increased by 1.6%.
The decrease of the total population of the Republic of Armenia could not but have its impact on the urban population.
 The number of RA urban population in 2018 decreased by 1% in 2011. compared to.
  In the cities of the Republic of Armenia (excluding Yerevan) the population decreased by about 3.8% [5].

Figure 8. Comparative Characteristics of Real Estate Transactions և Comparison of the Urban Population of the Republic of Armenia in 2011-2018Charts 7 to 8 It is obvious that the number of real estate transactions registered in the Republic of Armenia is increasing along with the decrease in population.
  It is noteworthy that the number of urban population in the cities of the Republic of Armenia is decreasing, and in Yerevan is increasing, as a result of which more transactions are registered in Yerevan.
  The increase in the number of registered transactions with real estate is done at the expense of Yerevan.
It is predicted that in 2019-2020 there will also be a decrease in population (due to the aging of the nation և due to migration), and an increase in the number of registered transactions in real estate.
  Migrants, leaving the borders of the Republic of Armenia, mainly sell or lease their property.
  These two types of transactions are frequented in the city of Yerevan [5, 6].
Thus, it can be said that the developments in the RA real estate market are conditioned by the socio-economic situation of the country, ենdepended on the following factors: o economic growth, macroeconomic stability, o revenue growth, o stabilization of the political situation, o implemented urban-investment programs, o Development of the mortgage market.
