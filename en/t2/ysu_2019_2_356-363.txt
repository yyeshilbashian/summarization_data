CURRENT DYNAMICS OF DEVELOPMENT OF RA-CSTO RELATIONS CURRENT SECURITY AGENDA
Armenia, being a founding member of the CSTO, is active within the framework of the alliance.
  The Republic of Armenia has a great contribution to the establishment of the military-political-legal bases of the structure.
 Armenia is trying to participate in the CSTO initiatives in full, contributing to the structural improvement and strengthening of its national security environment.
The importance of the CSTO for Armenia is also mentioned in the documents of the National Security Strategy and the Military Doctrine.
According to the National Security Strategy, the strategy of ensuring the external security of the Republic of Armenia is implemented in three main dimensions: international, regional and pan-Armenian.
 The international energy strategy includes membership in the CSTO, which is one of the components of ensuring Armenia's security.
 The National Security Strategy states: "The military component of the treaty provides privileged conditions for military-technical supplies to member states, which is of primary importance for Armenia."
In another key document in the field of security, the Military Doctrine, active և practical participation in CSTO programs is one of the priorities of international military-military-technical cooperation.
 The doctrine envisages the elaboration of the main directions of military policy, the development of the collective security system on a regional basis, the improvement of the CIS-CSTO air defense system, military-technical cooperation, and the training of military personnel [2].
As we can see, the role of the CSTO in the concept papers is highly valued in the field of ensuring the national security of the Republic of Armenia, it is considered the organic part of the military defense of the Republic of Armenia.
For Armenia, membership in the CSTO is especially advantageous to the military nature of the alliance.
 First of all, we are talking about a regime providing discounts in the field of CSTO military-technical cooperation.
 Russia has been supplying military products to CSTO member states since 2003 through Russia.
 This circumstance, of course, is of great importance for the Republic of Armenia, taking into account the importance of the availability of weapons in ensuring the security of the Republic of Armenia.
As already mentioned, one of the important tasks set by the CSTO is the creation of a joint air defense system.
 In this context, we think it is possible to refer to the agreement "On the establishment of a joint regional air defense system in the Caucasus region of collective security between Armenia and Russia" [3].
 It was approved by the Russian government on October 23, 2015, and adopted by the National Assembly on June 30, 2016. [4]
  CSTO Secretary General Bordyuzha expressed his opinion on this agreement: "Russian-Belarusian joint Russian-Kazakh air defense systems are already operating, and a similar system has been formed with Armenia for several years.
 The creation of such regional systems is the first stage of the process, in the second stage these systems will operate according to the same rules, which will allow to create an air defense system in the CSTO territory in the future. "[5]
  In this regard, former Deputy Minister of Defense D. Tonoyan noted, "The document creates a legal basis for the establishment of an air defense system in the Caucasus region of the Collective Security Treaty within the state borders of Armenia and Russia."
  This will allow not only the air defense forces of the 102nd Russian military base located in Armenia to use aviation, but also the forces of the Southern Military District of the Russian Federation during the protection of the airspace of the Republic of Armenia.
  It will provide additional guarantees for the security of the Republic of Armenia and the Russian Federation. "[6]
 In fact, Armenia, being the only representative of the region in the CSTO, joins the initiative to create a joint CSTO air defense system, based on the above-mentioned joint Russian-Armenian system.
Armenia-CSTO relations are developing in many ways.
  It is noteworthy that Armenia is actively involved in a number of CSTO military exercises, some of which are held in Armenia.
Within the framework of the work, let us refer to some of the above-mentioned military exercises. In particular, in 2008 In June-August, Armenia successfully hosted the Rubezh 2008 Joint Command-Staff Exercise on "Preparation for Joint Defense of RA Sovereignty և Territorial Integrity" [7], which provided an opportunity to test the Member States' commitment to collective defense. the measures to be taken in case of a threat of aggression or an act of aggression.
During the CSTO meeting in Moscow in 2009, which was chaired by the head of the CSTO presiding country S. Sargsyan, a decision was made to establish a "Rapid Response Collective Force" (RRF).
  The formation of these forces further strengthened the military component of the CSTO.
The Partnership 2012 exercise was held in Armenia on 19 February 2012 with the participation of special units of the Member States.
 According to the scenario, the RRF forces were to suppress the military aggression against the CSTO membership.
  During the exercise (2000 people were involved - more than 500 units of military equipment) the special units clearly carried out their tasks.
Summing up the results of the military exercise, N. Bordyuzha noted. "The military exercises passed at a very high level.
  All the units successfully solved their tasks and, most importantly, did it together very smoothly. "[9]
From September 30 to October 4, 2015, the "Inseparable Brotherhood 2015" military exercise of the CSTO Collective Peacekeeping Forces was held at the "Baghramyan" military school of the RA Ministry of Defense. Representatives of the CSTO Joint Staff և Secretariat [10].
 The main objectives of the exercise were to strengthen mutual understanding; cooperation between CSTO peacekeeping forces involved in the exercise; 10].
On May 24-26, 2016, the "Cobalt-2016" tactical-professional military exercise of the CSTO RRF member forces took place in Armenia [11].
 More than 600 personnel and about 40 units of equipment took part in the exercise.
  During the exercise, the units performed the following tasks: preventing the activities of terrorist organizations, restricting the illicit trafficking of weapons, explosives and drugs.
 The last joint military exercise in the Republic of Armenia was "Partnership 2017", which involved 2000 more than 400 military equipment of about 2000 servicemen [12].
The above-mentioned military exercises are just a few of the regular military exercises held within the CSTO, the participation of which equips the servicemen of the member-states with new knowledge and skills.
On September 15, 2015, the CSTO session of the CSTO was held in Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan, where Armenia received the rotation of the CSTO chairmanship from Tajikistan.
 During the session S. Sargsyan presented the priorities of the Armenian presidency in the coming year: • Increasing the collective potential of the CSTO in accordance with the principle of the առանգ Legislation of the Organization, • Further development of the conceptual bases of the CSTO activity, crisis response system, • Implementation of institutional aspects of CSTO efficiency Raising issues related to the development of cooperation with the CSTO system.
Ս. Sargsyan added. "We intend to focus on the issues of joint response to international terrorism, extremism, neo-fascism, chauvinism and other forms of xenophobia.
  In this context, we attach great importance to the activation of joint forces in the field of cyber security. "[13]
The period of the RA presidency was marked by its active activity and efficiency.
  2015-16 The measures taken were summed up during the CSTO Security Council meeting held on October 14, 2016, which was not attended by the President of Kazakhstan. Nazarbay!
Among the two dozen documents adopted during the session, one can single out և until 2025 ․ Adoption of the CSTO strategy, which is also one of the priorities of the Armenian presidency.
The adopted strategy includes such important points in terms of the development of the structure as: • Current CSTO collective security challenges և threats, • CSTO strategic goals ՀԱ tasks, • CSTO collective security system development tools.
For Armenia, the Yerevan summit was also adopted by adopting a "statement on the settlement of the Karabakh conflict."
The statement mentions the implementation of the agreements reached in Vienna and St. Petersburg on the Artsakh issue as a condition for political negotiations.
 In addition, the principles of the Helsinki Final Act are considered as the basis for the settlement of the conflict, in particular, the non-use of force or threat of force, the territorial integrity of states, equality of rights - the right of peoples to self-determination.
The adoption of the statement with such emphasis was a significant event at the level of the CSTO, taking into account the fact that the same CSTO-like countries cooperate quite closely with Azerbaijan, promoting the interests of the latter, if possible.
The fact that the former Secretary General of the National Security Council Yuri Khachaturov assumed the post of CSTO Secretary General on May 2, 2017, and the lieutenant general by the decree of March 22, 2018, testifies to the strength of the Armenian side. Haykaz Baghmanyan was appointed Deputy Chief of the CSTO Joint Staff.
  The appointment of Armenian representatives to these two positions is extremely important, as they further strengthen the position of the Armenian side in the CSTO.
In fact, being in a state of war, the existence of stable, reliable security systems is vital for Armenia, where the CSTO also has its special place.
 The fact that the CSTO enables Armenia to build more viable security systems is undeniable.
 Due to a number of events and military exercises organized within the framework of the CSTO, the Armenian Armed Forces are becoming more skilled and efficient.
  The opportunity to buy arms from Russia at a discount system within the CSTO is especially used for Armenia.
Besides, the structure is a platform from where the security issues of concern to the Republic of Armenia can be voiced.
Nevertheless, the CSTO, as a military-political structure ensuring the collective security of its members, is still in its infancy; Armenia must take this into account both in defining its expectations from the structure and in developing its defense policy.
 It is not appropriate to underestimate the role of the CSTO in the security system of Armenia, however, it is more dangerous to overestimate the CSTO, which can be crucial at the crucial moment.
 On the contrary, it can be argued that at present the bilateral military cooperation between Armenia and Russia is a more reliable support for Armenia in the event of an external threat than the CSTO with its passive stance, or Belarus and Kazakhstan with ambiguous and controversial behavior.
