INDIVIDUAL LINES AND REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RA MOUNTAINOUS AND HIGH MOUNTAINOUS TERRITORIES AND REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS Among the strategic problems of the socio-economic development of the Republic of Armenia, the development of the Republic of Armenia is of paramount importance.
  Among many other factors, the socio-economic development of the mountainous and highland areas of the republic is conditioned by the current situation of resettlement of similar areas, the processes taking place, as well as the important elements characterizing the resettlement, such as the nature of population and settlement, population, population and regional population. differences and features.
If the number of settlements in the mountainous-high mountainous areas of the republic is almost equal [1], then in terms of population the highland areas exceed the mountainous ones by more than 68 thousand.
This is, first of all, conditioned by the existence of larger landslides, grasslands and pastures suitable for permanent residence in high mountainous regions (mostly at the altitudes of 2000-2200 m).

 There are no high mountain settlements in Ararat բարձր Lori marzes, and the other six marzes have both mountainous and high mountain settlements.
2017 As of today, 45․2% of the population of the mountainous and high mountainous settlements of the Republic of Armenia fell to Gegharkunik region.
 5 out of 13 cities in the RA have similar territories (38%).
 They account for 44-9% of the urban population of such areas of the Republic of Armenia.
 The region is one of the most populous in the mountainous and high mountainous areas of the republic, both in terms of total area and agricultural land (Table 2).
 This is due to the existence of more favorable conditions for the development of agriculture in the coastal areas of the region, the formation of large villages, as well as the high natural population growth traditionally observed in the region.
The area usually inhabited in mountainous countries includes the main area of ​​rural settlements, arable lands, perennial plantations and other economic lands adjacent to the settlements.
 Forests, seasonal pastures, mountain pastures, as well as unused lands are left out of the inhabited area [3, 4].
  In this sense, the calculation of population density in highland areas according to arable lands can more realistically express the picture of the population of such areas [3].
  In the mountainous and high mountainous areas of Gegharkunik region, the density of the rural population according to arable lands is more than 246, and in terms of agricultural lands - 67 people / km2.
There are similar settlements in Shirak in all regions of the region, but about 78% of them are located in the regions of Amasia, Ashotsk and Artik.
  Moreover, in the first two regions all 47 such villages.
  The indices of the population density in the mentioned areas of the region are smaller than the corresponding average indicators of such areas of the Republic of Armenia (Table 2), which speaks about the relatively low population of the mountainous and high mountainous areas of Shirak.
  This refers mainly to the regions of Ashotsk and Amasia, where most of the settlements have a small population.
In Aragatsotn region, high mountainous settlements are located mainly in Aragats, Aparan and Talin regions.
All the villages of Aragats և Aparan regions ն Aparan have such a status.
 The population density indices in the mentioned areas of the region are 2-3 points higher than the RA average indicators in terms of the total area հող agricultural lands, and the density of the rural population in terms of agricultural lands և arable lands is 59 և 177 people / km2, respectively.
Kotayk region is the third in such areas in the population of the Republic of Armenia, as Hrazdan is the largest urban settlement in terms of population.
 The rural population of the mountainous "high mountainous areas" of the region are mainly located in the "Kotayk" regions of Hrazdan.
  The population indicators of all the mentioned areas of the region (except for the density of the rural population due to arable lands) exceed the average indicators of similar areas of the Republic of Armenia (Table 2).
More than half (16) of the mountainous settlements of Lori region are located in Spitak, the rest in Gugark and Tashir regions.
 About 68% of the mountainous population of the centralized region is in the Spitak region.
 The mountainous areas of the region in Armenia are distinguished by the highest density of rural population in terms of arable land (312 people / km2).
Syunik accounts for 4․4% of the total population 11 11 երի of the population of the mountainous տարած high mountainous areas of the republic.
 Here, more than 78% of the 66 գյուղ population of rural areas is concentrated in the Sisian region.
 The mentioned areas of the region occupy one of the last places in the RA with all indicators of population density, which testifies to the low population density of such areas of the region (Table 2).
20 villages in Vayots Dzor have such a status ը Jermuk city, which together account for only 2․4% of the population of such areas of the Republic of Armenia.
 In the region, such settlements are evenly distributed in the Vayk and Yeghegnadzor regions, and all population density indicators are several times (except for the rural population density index) several times lower than the RA average (Table 2).
Only 0․6% of the population of such territories of the republic falls on 6 mountain villages of Ararat region.
  Here, the population density indicators are not high, they are quite close to the corresponding indicators of Syunik and Vayots Dzor (Table 2).
In addition to the population density, the degree of population of the mountainous, high mountainous areas of the republic, one of the important indicators characterizing the resettlement is the density of rural settlements or the size of the area per unit area.
 The average density of rural settlements in the mentioned areas of the Republic of Armenia is 3 villages per 100 km2 (almost equal to the average index of the Republic of Armenia), and 3․6 per hectare of agricultural lands.
 The latter is 1․8 times smaller than the RA average.
 This is explained by the relatively high video weight of agricultural lands in the mountainous and high mountainous areas of the Republic of Armenia (particularly pastures and grasslands).
  The density of rural settlements in the mountainous-highland areas of the Republic of Armenia is higher in terms of total area և agricultural lands in Aragatsotn և Shirak, smaller Vayots Dzor, Syunik և Ararat marzes (Table 3).

There are villages in the high-mountainous areas of the Republic of Armenia, the population of which does not exceed a dozen, villages that belong not only to such areas, but also to the number of super-large ones throughout the Republic of Armenia.
  The average number of rural settlements in the mentioned areas of the Republic of Armenia is 1077 people, which in 2017 It is 278 less than the average index of the Republic of Armenia (1355).
  However, this indicator has significant differences by regions (Table 4).
Small (201-500 people) and medium-sized (501-1000 people) villages have the largest share in the total number of villages in the highland areas of the Republic of Armenia.
  They account for 21․9% of the population of 48-5 այդ of such villages.
 Villages with 201-1000 inhabitants in the Republic of Armenia make up 36․3% of the total number; they account for only 14․5% of the rural population of the Republic of Armenia [6].
  This means that in the system of resettlement of mountainous and high mountainous areas in comparison with the Republic of Armenia, the villages of small and large size have a bigger role.
Villages with 1001-3000 inhabitants have a special place in the RA's resettlement system in terms of number (312 villages) 45 population share (45%) [6], and the share of such villages in mountainous and high mountainous areas is less than the corresponding indicator of RA (33%) By 7․5% (Table 4).
 It should be noted that the relatively low percentages of the number of villages in the population of key settlements in such areas in Armenia should be considered a serious problem, as this group of villages has a greater potential in terms of both demographic and socio-economic development. occupying the RA rural areas և resettlement system.

Distribution of rural settlements in the mountainous and high mountainous areas of the Republic of Armenia նակDeployment of the population by villages (2017) Or by the number of large-large villages (11․2%) is less by 2․5%, but from the point of view of the share of the population they are almost equal (39․3 և 38․8%).
 The latter is explained especially by the concentration of large, super-large villages in the mountainous, high mountainous areas of Gegharkunik region.
In the mountainous, high-mountainous areas of the republic, a large number of villages (160 villages, 46%) make up to 500 villages with a population of; they account for only 10․3% of the rural population of the mentioned regions.
 It should be noted that such villages in Armenia in 2015 As of 2010, they accounted for 34-8% of the total number of villages with a permanent population, which accounted for 5-6% of the total rural population of the Republic of Armenia.
 Besides, the largest (96 villages, 27-7%) small (201-500 inhabitants) villages are in the mountainous, high-mountainous rural settlements of the republic, but they account for only 8-5% of the rural population of the mentioned areas (mountainous-high mountainous More than 57% of the RA villages with 201-500 inhabitants are located in the territories).
Villages with up to 200 inhabitants are of special importance in the mountainous and high mountainous areas of the Republic of Armenia.
 In the Republic of Armenia they make up 16․6% of the total number of villages (151 villages); they account for 1․3% of the rural population of the Republic of Armenia [6], and in the mountainous and high mountainous areas these indicators make respectively 18և5 և 1 ․8%.
 In this group of rural settlements, 16 out of 26 villages of the Republic of Armenia with up to 50 inhabitants, which are considered the most vulnerable in terms of demographic, socio-economic and perspective development, are located in high mountainous areas, mainly in Shirak and Syunik marzes (Table 5).
The distribution of the number of rural settlements in the mountainous, high mountainous areas of the republic is distinguished by noticeable territorial (regional) differences by population, which is given a detailed picture of the data given in Table 5.
When summarizing and generalizing the results of the analysis, it is possible to conclude that the distribution of population երից settlements in the mountainous և high-mountainous areas of the Republic of Armenia is distinguished by a strict territorial (regional) disproportion.
 The population density is relatively high in Gegharkunik, Kotayk, Aragatsotn and Shirak marzes.
 Gegharkunik, Lori, Kotayk, Aragatsotn, Syunik, Vayots Dzor, Ararat and Shirak regions have the highest rates of rural population density. Due to the large differences in the number of rural settlements in the mountainous and high mountainous areas of the Republic of Armenia. In Lori and Kotayk marzes, which have a higher average population of villages than the average of mountainous and high mountainous areas, in other regions this indicator is noticeably smaller, the distribution of rural settlements in the mountainous and highland areas of Armenia has large regional differences.
 There are villages with 201-1000 inhabitants in all regions, mostly in Aragatsotn, Shirak and Gegharkunik.
  Shirak and Syunik marzes have the largest share in the group of villages with up to 200 inhabitants.
 More than 73% of large villages are located in the highlands of Gegharkunik, and Gegharkunik, Shirak, Aragatsotn and Lori marzes have the largest share in the group of villages with 1001-3000 inhabitants.
 There is no village with more than 2000 inhabitants in such areas of Syunik, Vayots Dzor and Ararat marzes.
The results of the analysis of the spatial differences and peculiarities of the characteristics of resettlement in the high-mountainous areas of the Republic of Armenia can be used in the compilation of socio-economic development programs, regional policy, resettlement issues, individual regions, and socio-economic development programs.
