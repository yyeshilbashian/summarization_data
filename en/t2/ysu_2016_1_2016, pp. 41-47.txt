FEATURES OF JAVAKHK SEISMIC ZONES, CONDITIONED WHITE 1988 EARTHQUAKE Javakhk highlands are one of the most active seismic zones in the South Caucasus.
  Strong, sometimes catastrophic earthquakes are typical of Caucasian faults.
 The strong earthquake in Spitak, which shook the whole area, is directly connected with the seismic zone of Javakhk.
There are separate segments of active faults in Javakhk, Pambak-San-Syunik and Garni in the area set aside for our studies.
The Javakhk fault was discovered by Karakhanyan և Baghdasaryan in 2007. After Jdran, it was examined jointly by an Armenian-Georgian group.
  The southern part of the fault is located in Armenia, and the northern part in the territory of Georgia (Figure 1).
  The direction of total fault propagation is north-north-west, it consists of three segments: 44 km long JaF1, 44 km long JaF2 2 33 km long JaF3.
 Signs of surface faults caused by strong earthquakes in the past are recorded along all segments of the Javakhk fault.
 During the 20th century, there were more than 40 earthquakes with magnitudes ranging from 4.5 to 5.7 և many times weaker events (Figure 2).
The GPS measurements made jointly by GEORISK CJSC and the University of Montpellier-France in France show that the highest movement velocities are recorded in the area of ​​the Javakhk fault. north-south ”with compression speeds [13].
The Pambak-Shan-Syunik Fault (PSSF) has a total length of 490 km and extends from Arpilj (north-western Armenia) to the southeast, the Araks River valley on the Armenian-Iranian border.
  Among the active faults in Armenia, it has the longest length, the speeds of movement, and the strongest earthquakes are connected with it [1, 3,5].
  The fault is characterized by significant seismic activity.
  Arpi-Vanadzor և Vanadzor-Artanish segments have lengths of 50 ± 5 km և 75 ± 5 km, respectively.
Arpi-Vanadzor (PSSF1) ից From the junction of the Vanadzor-Artanish (PSSF2) segments, the westbound PSSF belt joins the Garni Active Fault (GF).
 A structure with many young cracks is formed at the junction.
The Garni Fault consists of 5 segments.
  Following its high tectonic activity (0.3-0.2 cm / year), the Garni fault has repeatedly shown high seismic activity.
1988 The Spitak earthquake occurred on the northern part of the Garni fault, creating a 37 km long seismic fault.
 The Spitak (GF1) segment is 56 km long (Fig. 3).
 According to GPS data, the displacement velocity of the GF1 segment is 2 mm / year [6,7].
The Spitak earthquake was a complex seismic event accompanied by various kinematic movements [8,10].
  According to seismological data, the main shock zone was located north of Spitak town, and the movement in the epicenter had an internet-slip mechanism.

In order to describe and analyze the spatial distribution of the number of seismic events, we used not only the data from the National Catalog of the Republic of Armenia, but also the data of 14 digital seismic stations installed in the Republic of Armenia within the framework of the joint research program of Taiwan Sinika University.
  With that initiative, the first seismic station was installed in 2010. In Byurakan, then in Geghard (2011), Nor Edesia (2011), Zarinja (2012), Alaverdi (2012), Tsapatagh (2012), Arzakan (2012), Bavra (2012), Lchashen (2012), Navur (2013), Kechut (2014), in Gavar (2014), which cover the northern և central parts of the territory of the Republic, fully covering the part selected for our studies.
  Guralp-6TD three-component digital seismometer is installed in each seismic station.
  The earthquakes recorded by these stations were developed and analyzed by the following computer programs: DIMAS-Display, Interactive Manipulation and Analysis of Seismograms, which ensures high accuracy of the received data [8].
  The main parameters characterizing the seismic situation of the selected zone were determined and interpreted through the catalog of earthquakes compiled as a result. for the period.
  The temporal distribution characteristics of earthquakes were studied using the Zmap6 computer package.
According to the data of the above-mentioned catalogs, in the seismic zone of Javakhk in 1962-2014. The distribution of the epicenters of earthquakes is presented in Figure 4, where we have singled out 3 areas of interest for the study, which in the instrumental period almost always stand out with significant accumulations of epicenters.
If we consider those 3 zones separately, it becomes clear that before Spitak 1988. The earthquake is observed in all 3 zones with seismic calm.
Zone 1.
  During the 25 years preceding the Spitak earthquake, about 870 earthquakes with a magnitude of 2.5 <M <5.0 were registered, the hypocenters of which are located at depths of up to 5 km.
  After the Spitak earthquake, 530 earthquakes were registered in this zone, the depths of the hypocenters of which reach 30 km (Figures 5.6, Table 1).

Distribution of magnitude values ​​in Zone 1 in 1980-1990. Figure 6. Distribution of hypocenters in Zone 1 according to depth Zone 2.
 It is a zone covering a relatively larger area, which includes the active fault of Javakhk.
 Although seismic calm was observed here before the Spitak earthquake, nevertheless until 1988. Numerous earthquakes with hypocenters up to 35 km deep occurred (Figures 7.8, Table 2).

  It took place in 1988. Spitak M = 7.0 earthquake.
  In the previous decade, very few earthquakes were recorded, with an average magnitude of M = 3.5.
 On December 7, 1988, an earthquake M = 7.0 was registered, which was followed by numerous aftershocks of magnitude M> 4.0.
  As the data show, 1988 Then there were about 9 times more earthquakes in that segment than before, for the same period (25 years) (Figures 9,10, Table 3).
Table 3. Statistics in Zone 3 Zone 3M (magnitude) H (depth) N (quantity) Before the 1988 Spitak earthquake After the 1988 Spitak earthquake H <5 km H <35 kmFigure 9. Distribution of magnitude values ​​in Zone 3 1980- 1990 Figure 10. Distribution of hypocenters in depth in Zone 3 As shown by the data obtained, 1988. After the Spitak earthquake, a decrease in the number of registered earthquakes is observed in zones 1 և 2 (calculations were made for the periods 25 years before the իտ Spitak earthquake), and in the 3rd zone, a sharp increase (9 times more).
 This indicates that after the Spitak earthquake, due to the discharge of energy (zone 3), a decrease in seismic tension is observed in zones 1 և 2, instead, a very sharp seismic activation is observed in zone 3.
Collecting the seismic data of the Javakhk seismic zone, as well as receiving it in the zones separated from the outside until 1988. The Spitak earthquake is the image of seismicity, we can come to the conclusion that the seismic image in those isolated zones of Javakhk has a certain regularity. Spitak 1988 Before the strong earthquake, seismic calm is observed in the whole zone of Javakhk.
 It is noteworthy that regardless of the fact that a strong earthquake is registered in the hunting seismic zone of Javakhk (in separate zones), the whole seismic zone of Javakhk is being prepared for it, expressing itself with local seismic calm with accumulation of huge energy.
It is known that the occurrence of seismic calm is typical of strong earthquakes.
  Analyzes of strong earthquakes in the region (Chaldran 1976 (M = 7.0), Norman 1983 (M = 6.7), White 1988 (M = 7.0), Racha 1991 (M = 7.0), Barisakho 1992 (M = 6.4) show that seismic calm was observed before, the magnitude of which, depending on the magnitudes of the earthquakes being prepared, was different [1].
 The fact that in the epicenter zone of Spitak earthquake (zone 3) until 1988. The earthquake was considered seismic calm, it is a scientifically substantiated fact [1].
 However, the fact that seismic calm was observed in the 1 և 2 isolated zones of Javakhk during the same period suggests that the isolated seismic zones of Javakhk have certain similarities in the geological deep structure.
The relationship between seismicity in the Caucasus and deep geological structure has been studied and analyzed by various authors [4,12].
 L. A. Vardanyants proposed the seismotectonic model of the Akhalkalaki-Lenin seismically active zone [12], according to which there is a collision zone.
Thus, there is a certain connection (expressed by seismic exits) between the seismic zones of Javakhk, which is also conditioned by the peculiarities of the deep geological structure. .
Despite the fact that the aftershocks of the Spitak earthquake were quite large in terms of quantity, the graph of the recurrence of earthquakes shows that in that zone in 1989-2014. There is a deficit of earthquake with magnitude M = 5.0 և for the period (Figure 11).
Figure 11. Graph of recurrence of earthquakes in the Javakhk zone in 1989-2014. Summing up, we can make the following conclusions: երում For the studies in the seismic zones separated by us until Spitak 1988. The earthquake is considered "seismic calm".
 It is noteworthy that the latter was observed not only in the epicenter of the Spitak earthquake, but in the whole Javakhk seismic zone, which allows us to assume that the Javakhk seismic zone is complete.
There is a certain connection (expressed by seismic excavations) between the seismic zones of Javakhk, which is conditioned by the peculiarities of the deep geological structure.
 On the other hand, according to L. A. Akhalkalak-Lenina proposed by Vardanyants have a seismotectonic model of a seismically active zone, there is a collision zone here.
  Therefore, it is assumed that there is a deep geological connection between the seismic zones separated by us, which is created through that very border.
 Despite the fact that the aftershocks of the Spitak earthquake were quite large in terms of quantity, the graph of the recurrence of earthquakes shows that in that zone in 1989-2014. There is a deficit of earthquake with magnitude M = 5.0 և for the period.
։ The obtained data are quite relevant from the point of view of assessing the seismic situation of Javakhk, considering its separate seismic zones as one complete seismic zone.
 The obtained results can be included in further more detailed research, in particular, the connection of seismicity with studies of deep geological structure.
