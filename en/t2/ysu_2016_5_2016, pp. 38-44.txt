TALISHEREN VOICE SYSTEM 1 Talysh language belongs to the group of Caspian dialects of the northwestern sub-branch of Iranian languages.
  It is closely related to the Southern dialect, and during its historical development it was greatly influenced by the neighboring Gilani, Azerbaijani and, of course, Persian.
 In Talysh, two dialects can be distinguished: northern and southern, based on a purely border division, while by linguistic standards, in fact, there are northern, central and southern dialects.
 The most striking difference between Talysh and Persian is that this language has a richer phonetic system, which is why there is a need to study the phonetic system of the latter in depth, to complete all the existing data.
In this article, an attempt will be made to examine the pronunciation features of each of the Talysh vowels separately, as well as to find out how much they are influenced by the syllable, stress factors, and the surrounding phonetic environment2.
In Talysh, as in many modern Iranian languages, vowels are not stable.
They can be changed in the presence or absence of stress.
 The quantitative stability of the vowel is noticeably affected by the fact that the syllable is open or closed, the vowels surrounding the vowel sound, the consonant in the word fall, the merging of the two vowels, etc.
  In unstressed syllables, its spelling is determined by the quantitative, qualitative, or instability of the vowels.
The following phenomena in the phonetic system of the Northern Talysh language are conditioned by long-term contacts with the Turkic languages, in particular with the Azerbaijani language. The partial harmony of the vowels: progress ընթաց reversal, u և change of pronunciation of sounds.
 Talysh vowels can be presented in the following table. By RowOn RiseLow RiseMiddle RiseUp RiseFirst RowMiddle RowRear Row The vowels presented above are characterized by the following features ևFeatures./i/ The sound of the first row is the sound of the upper row.
 In the open stressed syllable it corresponds to the above-mentioned qualitative description է is full-sounding. si: "garlic", "full", "thirty", vi - "willow", gi - "neck", di - "village", i - "one", pinti - "dirty", "clumsy", tiši: "Sprout".
 In the closed stressed syllable i, completely preserving the quality, changes quantitatively. has the longest lengths before v, z, ու and r. šiv - "branch", miz - "table", tiž - "spicy", "sharp", tir - "arrow".
  I is pronounced shorter than nipples, l, nasal m, n. vis: “pa1 The Talysh are an Iranian people who live mainly in the southern Caspian region of the southern ՀանրապետությանIranian Republic of Iran.
2 The examples presented in the article are taken from L. From Pirayko's "Talysh-Russian Dictionary".
  See Pireyko L., Talysh-Russian Dictionary, Moscow, 1976.
3 According to S. Vinogradova's quantitative feature is subject to qualitative contrast, has no independent phonological significance, therefore it is secondary.
 See Vinogradova S., Talysh language, languages ​​of the world, Iranian languages.
 Northwestern Iranian Languages, Moscow, 1999, p. 91.
րան », riš -" beard ", garbage -" garbage ", dim -" face "," face ", sin -" age ", šin -" sweet ".
 I is shortened the most before the deaf explosions. dik - "straight", pišik - "cat", bilit - "ticket", kibrit - "match".
Less i is shortened before loud explosions. bib - "serk-il" (Hebrew: bi), id - "holiday", ig - "thigh".
 In the open unstressed syllable, i significantly retains its quality, only slightly decreasing in quantity. imon - "faith", pie - "want", onimon - "life", kinä - "girl", misol - "example", ni (ə) šon - "sign".
  It shortens even more before the interlinguistic y. ziyon - "harm", žie - "live", piyoz - "onion".
  The pronunciation of i in the closed unstressed syllable is the shortest, but it retains its quality. inson - "man", viždon - "conscience", vinde - "look", zindon - "prison", nisbät - "about", piškäš - "gift", rismon - "rope".
Non-historical i is found in words beginning with the consonant st, sp. ispička - "match", istakan - "cup".
There is also i of secondary origin in the language, which is formed as a result of the narrowing of the unstressed e. nemek> nimek - "salt".
 We find this phenomenon at the end of the second person plural of the following tense: -eon> -ion (bakardi! On - "you will do") in the macabre derby with և-դերd (. (՛E a ada> ši a ada - "going", be a ada > biada "being") 1.
The use of the i sound in grammatical forms is quite wide. • it is included in the past imperfective verb endings: -im, -iš, -i, -imon, -ion, -in, as it is found in its negative forms: nim, niš, ni, nimon, nion, nin, • exists at the end of an indefinite verb -ie (Persian: idan). pie - "to wish", "to love", gənie - to "fall", • in the oblique case of nominal structures. məni - "me", təni - "you", • the stressed i occurs in ergative sentences. merdi vote - "the man said", • i is an abstract suffix. väši - "hunger", hovizi - "breadth", täši - "thirst", "thirst", as it forms the suffixes -li diminutive and short, -či indicating the name of the actor, -äti abstract nouns. kinäli - "sister", kanči - "peasant", bärobäräti - "equality", • in Azerbaijani -miš derby forms. k ս čmiš be - to "move", pozmiš karde - to "spoil", • the stressful i expresses the uncertainty and uniqueness of the noun (ya-ye vähdät). ruzi - "one day" 2.
The i of the northern dialects in the southern dialects can be changed to the vowels e, ə, ä. čimi (northern) - čəmən (Astara) - čemen (Taleshdulab) - čämän (Masali) - čəmən (Masule) - "my", h irs (northern) - xers (Masali) - xərs (Masule) - "bear", sipä ( northern) - espä (Astara) - esbä (Taleshdulab) - äsbä (Masali) - əspä (Masule) - "dog", šit (northern) - šet (Astara) - šet (Taleshdulab) - šət (Masali) - šət (Masal) ) - "milk" 3.
The / e / sound is a first-order, mid-range sound.
 In the open accented syllable it is more often found, where it is quantitatively longer. ve - "a lot", ke - "numb", "petrified", ne - "no", pe - "up", se - "three", še - "go".
  In a closed accented syllable, e, depending on the syllable ending in the syllable, is shortened quantitatively.
  E sounds louder than syllables, especially before vowels: v, z, ž, slightly shorter before r, և before shorter explosions. nez - "close", ser - "zker", vek - "kidney".
 Qualitatively, e is not so stable and sometimes even turns into ə, ä, i vowels, that is, it changes the quality a lot. šex || šəx (γ) - "dew", "sprinkle", beγ || bəγ - "mustache", deven || devän - "harvest", ne || nä - "no", heč || hič - "no մի », zevel || zevil -« coal ».
  The lowercase syllable e occurs in the singular 1st և 2nd and plural 3rd person of the day after tomorrow: bägiem - "I will take", bäkarde - "you will do", bävoten - "they will say".
 In these verbs, e is stable.
In an open unstressed syllable, e easily loses its quality and can turn into և և even i, ä և u.bexə || bəxə - "oven", žego || žəgo - "so", nemek || nimek - "salt", hežo || huž օ - "always", "often", tedäruk || tädorək - "preparation".
  After the vowel a, o, u vowels, e is shortened to i.
  It usually occurs in the verbs of transitive verbs in fluent speech 2 Ibid., Pp. 34-35.
"Stay" in verbs. doe || doi - "he gave", masae || masai - "he heard".
 In case of passing from the accent e to the preceding syllable, the open syllable e can be squeezed, which, for example, leads to a significant change in the verb "speak". votédäm || vótdäm || vóttäm.
  The same phenomenon is observed karde - "to do", barde - "to carry", mandédäm || mandäm, where the disappearance of e is not compensated by anything.
 In the inflected verbs e n a a becomes before the vowels i. ni-a - "did not happen", žän-i-ä - "you hit" 1.
  Let's take the example of the closed syllable e, which is also not stable and can be narrowed down by alternating vowels. vedrä - "bucket", derzi (därzi) - "tailor", dešmen (dəšmen) - "enemy", zehnin - "smart", mehkäm - "strong", respublikä - "state".
"Bring", mande: In some words there is an e of secondary origin, which is stable և does not change its quality.
  It is created as a result of the merging of either the ai, ei consonant. kaina> keina> kēna - "when", leina> lēna - "shvi" (transliteration from neila), neigo> nego - "bull", or in the middle of a consonant. nexčir || nexči> nēči - "wild beast", "wolf".
It is necessary to consider na և `, the so-called ya-ye mäjhul.
  Thus, words of relative significance have been preserved in Talysh. kēk - "flea", sēf - "apple", pēša - "craft", hēč - "nothing", vēv - "widow".
 This e represents length and relative stability.
 Only in the word vēv, due to accentuation, the sequence of և `is recorded: vöv2.
In grammatical terms e is found. • at the end of an indefinite derby. be - to be, vote - to speak, vite - to "run", hore - to "grind", zəne - to "know", • in the verbal e- և pe- prefixes. edoe - to "cover", egarde - to "come down", pevate - to "tear", peγande - to "hang", • in the present tense of the definite article, which consists of the indefinite verb, -da after the verb endings. porsedam - "I ask", omedan - "they are coming", • at the end of the singular 3rd person singular of the day after (1). bavite - "he will run away", bapie - "he will want", • be- (without) prefix (where e is under secondary stress). beaγl - "stupid", bedəl - "heartless", bemäno - "meaningless", besädo - "silent", betam - "tasteless", bexäbä - "unaware", bečiz - "have", • be- (out) verb prefix (with secondary emphasis). bevarde - "take out"
3 The e of the northern dialects in the south can in some cases be converted to i or.. sef (northern) - sif (Astara) - sif (Taleshdulab) - sif (Masali) - sef (Masuleh) - "apple", äse (ars) (northern) - äserg (Taleshdulab) - asərk (Masali) - "tears" 4.
The / ä / sound is a short, low-pitched, low-pitched sound.
  The quality of the vowel is most evident in the case of an open accented syllable. vänäšä - "violet", kä - "home", nänä - "mother", sä - "head", hä - "donkey", səpä - "dog", in the past tense - kardä - "done", hardä - "eaten" , in the pronouns amä - "we", šəmä - "you", as in the case of closed syllables: bäd - "bad", bärk - "strong", "strong", väräγ - "newspaper", gäv - "mouth", γäzän - "pot", γälmäγäl - "noise", mäč - "kiss", odäm - "man", šäv - "night", šäm - "candle", äv - "he".
  The vowel preserves the quality in case of an open unstressed syllable. vätän - "homeland", dävo - "medicine", dämirči - "blacksmith", däli - "crazy", mäse - "listen", xäto - "danger", čäkuš - "hammer", in the present tense - zəndä - "nagiti" ", Bäme ä dä -" he cries ", -ädä - in the past tense - di! Ädä - in the" village ", po! Zäde -" in the fall ", in the suffix -ä suffix, which is accepted by the qualitative adjectives: yo! L - ä ru: "Big river", xo! S-ä kinä - "beautiful girl", even in a weaker phonetic situation, in case of a closed unstressed syllable. bayγuš "owl", däftär - "notebook", zählä - "disgust", mäxluγ - "people", säyfä - "page", särvoz - "soldier".
  In the predominant position of վրա, the pronunciation is influenced by the interlinguistic y և consonants containing their interlinguistic features5.
  For example: niyä - "khnotsi", šiyä - "clay", "clay", bäyändə - "each other", däše - "to enter", täšviš - "alarm", häši - "ar", čäš - "eye".
  The տարբերակը approach to the middle row appears under the influence of post-linguistic, linguistic, post-linguistic vowels հետ at the end of the word.. gädä - "small", "junior", gäšti - "ship", käläm - "cabbage", källä - "head", käno - "tip", "shore", kärvon - "caravan", hämro - "spouse", γälib - "ձև", γäfä - "coffee", γänd - "sugar", xäsis - "greedy", xät - "line".
Thus, the sound ին can be classified as a relatively stable vowel, as qualitatively its awkward state does not differ much from that of the accent, and quantitatively it is shortened, but does not shrink.
 We notice certain phonological changes only from a morphological point of view.
  In the Masuli dialect, when the vowel i is joined by the indefinite article i, it is changed to e. hmmt. kellä - "girl" և kelle-i - "a girl", čäšmä - "source" čäš čäšme-i - "source".
 The last այ of Bayarmat, joining the վերջ of the endings,, is in turn i i. hmmt. bə-nä-m "that I ask" և bə-ni-äm "that we ask" 1.
According to V. According to Schulze's phonological analysis, which reflects the Talysh dialect of Shuvi, ä is the most common sound.
  In terms of frequency, it is followed by the vowels i, o, e, o, a, ü.
 However, և is less common in eggs.
According to the grammatical applicability, the vowels are given with the following frequency: e, i, ü, ə, ä, o, a2.
The / a / sound is postlinguously low-pitched.
  It differs both qualitatively and quantitatively from և occurs in a certain phonetic environment առաջ before certain consonants • ard, arz, ars. ars - "tears", tars - "fear", dars - "lesson", karde - "do", barde - "carry", pard - "bridge", sard - "cold", barz - "high", darz - "Splash", larze - "tremble".
In Ard, arz groups, especially in words beginning with b, v, m, a has a tendency to lip, sometimes intensifying to ուժեղ. barde || borde - to "carry", varde || vorde - to "bring", marde || morde - to "die", garde || gorde - to "rotate", • nd in connection. band - "connection", "mountain", hande - "read", zande - "give birth", mande - "stay", gandəm - "wheat", • ng connection. taŋg - "narrow", maŋg - "moon", vaŋg - "scream", zaŋg - "bell", raŋg - "color", čaŋgo - "nail", "claw", • mb group. tambäl - "lazy", pambä - "cotton", hambol - "porter", zambul - "basket", čambä - "bundle", • the first consonant is nipple s or,, the second is explosives d, t, p, m. däbaste - "to tie", astä - "bone", maštä - "morning", asp - "horse", dasparde - "hand over", dašt - "field", "steppe", pašmä - "wool", • The first consonant is the vocal consonant l, the second is the explosive consonants d, t, g. Balduz - "give" (friend), saldat - "soldier", balta - "ax", γaltäγ - "saddle", palgä "Green branch" in • vz, vd relations. tavzə - "scales", xavzä - "melon", čavdär - "rye", • axt, axš in groups. taxt - "throne", taxtä - "throne", vaxt - "time", baxš - "section", "gift", baxše - "forgive", naxš - "pattern", • aft. kafte - "dove", kaftor - "hyena", haft - "seven", haftä - "week" (7 days).
The lip version is sometimes distinguished by։.
  Apparently, it is found mainly in closed syllables, before the vowel and prepositional vowels (nd, ng, št tends to be the most pronounced in words with consonants, the examples of which we see below), and the non-vowel is found in open syllables, with the consonant հ. za - "Persian", ya - "or", "or", ka - "foam", sa - "hundred", ča - "pulley".
  In dialects, the degree of accentuation of a may vary.
  For example, in the Astara dialect the main version of its pronunciation is closed and accented, and in the Lankaran dialect it is characterized by a weaker accent 3.
  In Asalem dialect a is more vowel than in Persian և can be changed to s before m և n. Gelun - "Gillan", badam || badum - "almond".
4 In the Masul dialect, the last a of the verb before կարող can be changed to օ, and before i, y to s. vo-՝m - "we say", vu-im - "I said", vu-y - "he said".
5 In Talysh there is a secondary origin a, which is formed in the following cases.2 The high grammatical value of the sounds E և i becomes obvious if we connect it with the position of the ending of the word, ie in that position e appears as the ending of the indefinite verb և of the past. Auxiliary verb in the singular 3rd person, and i in the oblique case.
 See Schulze W., Northern Talysh, Munich, 2000, pp. 9-15.
• Historical AS. tām - "food", "food" (tä'äm), sāt - "hour" (sa'ät), • as a result of falling of a consonant following a. pālu - "side" (<pählu), rās - "dancing" when two syllables are combined. šikayät> šikat - "complaint", • when the ai consonant turns into a. aište> ašte - "he arose".
The 1 / o / sound is a backward, mid-rise, vocalized sound.
 The open syllable o has a certain length, which increases at the end of the sentence in case of an absolute pause. asbo - "horseman", vo - "wind", `o - "happy", sado - "voice", dovo - "prayer", zomo - "groom", kolo - "hat", po - "foot", podšo` "King".
 O prefix (Old Iranian * ava- prefix) exists in the verbs ō-bərie - to "cut", ō-gate - "to preserve".
  The open syllable o in dialects can be replaced by u. kō || kū - "business", dō || dū - "tree", gō || gū - "cow", sor || sur - "year".
 Closed syllable stress differs from closed stress syllable both qualitatively and quantitatively.
 It is both more open and shorter, the increase of which depends on the syllable of the syllable. Explosive և deaf consonants contribute to the openness and shortness of the sound, while the consonants and vowels contribute to the closure և 2 (e.g. xok - "country", "land" և poγ - "stepfather", čok - "good" և xov - "dream" ", Kok -" full "և lod -" thin ", pok -" clean "և tos -" bowl ", pot -" odd "և toγ -" thread ").
  O is more closed before vowels v, z,.. ov - "water", mordov (mərdov) - "swamp", nov - "knee", poz - "autumn", soz - "regulated", tormoz - "brake".
  The degree of loudness before the speakers is different.
 Before L it is more open than before r (pronounced: yol - "big", gol - "swampy lake", lol - "dumb" և mor - "snake", vožor - "market", por , "feather").
 Before n, o, in very rare cases, can turn into u. gon - "heavy", nodon - "ignorant", bon - "attic", rayon - "district", goävon - (guävon) "foreman", zəmson (zomsun, Ast., Ler. brbr .: zomoston) "winter », Tovson (Ast .: tobiston) -" summer ", and the ending of the plural of the noun -on in dialects is sometimes heard -un. sorun - years, dandonun - teeth, dasun - hands.
 The unstressed o of the open syllable mainly retains its quality. toləš - "talish", vote - "say", γ օ näγ - "guest", komäg - "help", noe - "put", hovä - "sister", tožä - "new".
 Like the open syllable o, this o և can be turned into u. ome (ume) - "come", gomuš (gumuš) - "buffalo", γ օ ti (γuti) - "box", nokä (nukä) - "servant", sobun (subun) - "soap", xoruz (huruz) "Rooster".
  In a few words, the transition from na և to և a և a is observed. vožor (vəzor) - "market", moä (məä) - "mother", sobit (səbut) - "proof", nomus (namus) - "honor", xolčä (xalčä) - "carpet".
In complex words, the first component of which is a full name containing o, it always retains its quality. goduš - "cow" (go - "cow"), doču - "wooden frame" (do - "tree"), čošamba - "Wednesday" (čo - "four").
 The open stress syllable o depends quantitatively on the fact that it is close to the stress syllable ադարձ is inversely related to it: the farther o is from the stress, the shorter o is. zomsuni - "watermelon", bodəmčon - "eggplant", gobäläk - "mushrooms", korätän - "spider".
 Pakwank's stressful generally retains its quality even in this weaker state: asmon - "heaven", boston (bəston) - "vegetable garden", bofte - "knit", "weave", boxšäb - "plate", dolmä: "Dolma", dorčin - "cinnamon", doxtur - "doctor", porse (parse) - "ask".
In some Talysh words vav-e mäjhul is found. mor - "bee", kok - "fat" 3.
The o of the northern dialects in the south can be alternated with the vowels u, a, ä. zoä (northern) - zuä (Astara) - zue (Taleshdulab) - zuä (Masali) - zoä (Masuleh) - "son, boy", ov (northern) - av (Astara) - av (Taleshdulab) - av (Masali) - av (Masule) - "water", osm (osson) (northern) - äsün (Masali) - asen (Masule) - "iron" 4.
The first language version of O `ö sound, under the influence of the Azerbaijani phonetic system միջոցով penetrated into Talysh through word borrowings.
  In pure Talysh words it is seldom heard, moreover it can be alternated with other short-heard vowels. tö || tə - "you", hör || här - "fog", šöp || šəp || šep - "basket", bolöš || boləš - "pillow".
 The phonetic change of the last two words may be the result of the vowels progressing.
Բառըmr - the word "life" is pronounced ömr under the influence of the following lip.
  In Azerbaijani words, the formation of կարող can be influenced by the soft pronunciation of the next Azerbaijani l5.
 For example: ölči - "size", ölčmiš karde - "measure", ölgä - "country", "region".
The / u / sound is a postlinguistic, upturned, lip-voiced sound.

It is stable both qualitatively and quantitatively, as it does not decrease to և 0 sound.
The volume of the vowel is quite different վում varies depending on the sound position.
  The stressed syllable of the open syllable is the narrowest and is usually narrow, in the closed syllable it is wide and sounds short.
  Influenced by the Azerbaijani phonetic system, we also find in Talysh the first language version of this sound, ü, which is similar to the French s in ruse, sûr.
 B. Miller defines ü as the main sound, and s as its variant, based on the Lankaran dialect, where ü is more common, as well as the fact that in the first school textbook published by the Talysh, the transmission of this sound was accepted as s. with both y (ü), with s appearing in relatively few words 1.
 B. Miller's argument is confirmed by L. By Piraeus, who believes that ü, which is considered to be the main variant in the northern dialects, is absent in the south2.
  It should be noted, however, that in the dialects of Anbaran և Asalem, in addition to s, the sound առանձն ü is distinguished, which is proved by a distinctive feature (kul - "khak", "thas", kül - "shalak", "us", du: "Butter", dü - "smoke") 3.
 A. In Rafi's "Talysh-Persian Dictionary", which presents the speech of Alian Dehestan near the village of Fuman, the sound is found in the Latin y և vi Persian inscriptions (for example, vid [dy] - "smoke", wit [ty] - "saliva") 4.
  But in Masule's dialect, which is reflected in J. In Lazarus' texts, the version ü is completely absent5.
  Among the northern dialects, the use of ü is most typical of the Lankaran dialect (Ast., Ler.: Ku, Lenk.: Kü - "blind", Ast., Ler. - bu, Lenk. - bü - "smell") 6.
The phonetic cause for the more pronounced pronunciation of U (ü) is the pre-lingual consonants այս in the speech առ the presence of pre-lingual vowels (i, e, ä), and the arguments that prevent it are the linguistic consonants (x, γ) and post-lingual vowels (a, o). ) effect 7 (hmt: γul - "slave", γuti - "box", xun - "blood", loku - "rice bread", kuč (koč) "nomad", mum - "candle", musiγi - music Եւ düävož - "liar", lülä - "pipe", sün - "pillar", süte - "burn", tüm - "tribe", "tribe", tülä - "hunting dog").
 According to B. Only Miller's version is accepted. ustul - "chair", guluz - "saliva", gulul - "coil", kuku - "omelet".
In large Arabic borrowings, the Talysh s ալի ü coincides with the Arabic long and short s և even the long ս. mahbub - "beloved", amu - "uncle", uzv - "member", amluk - "estate" (Arabic: amlāk), arbub - "landlord", "buyer" (Arabic: arbāb), sülfa - tablecloth », Hüzür -" presence ", nür -" light ", dükon -" shop ", ümr -" life ".
 In the Azeri loans, which are less numerous, we find a distinction between two types of s, corresponding to the Azerbaijani sin և ü (plural: yongu - "bed", yun - "wool", duman - "fog", dusax - "prison" և especially after the post-linguistic and post-linguistic ones guldur - "robber", γuzi - "lamb", garage - "eagle" և alüsti - "right now", düymä - "hat", düz - "straight" և -lü suffix (bafolü - "faithful" »)).
The / ә / sound is interlinguistic, middle-pitched.
  The significance of this sound is confirmed by its semantic differentiating role, forming minimal pairs with i. pə - "father" և pi - "oil", sə - "yard", "red" և si - "full", "garlic", də - "two", with the preposition և di - "village".
 In just a few words we find the transition from i to.. šimol || olmol - "north", zing || zəng - "knee", čirkin || kinrkin - "dirty".
 Qualitatively չէ is not stable և both in case of stress and in case of stress, it can turn into օ, ö, u. šəp || šöp - "basket", tə || tö - "you", dəyo || doyo - "sea", xəyo || xoyo - "cucumber", čəboγ || čopoγ - "chibukh", bərku || burku: "Heat", γəbon || γubon - "victim", γədrät || γudrät - "force".
 The stressed syllable աց of the open syllable is easily spelled, especially before the vowels.1 Later in the textbooks we see the transmission of that vowel with the letter s, regardless of the peculiarities of pronunciation.
