INFLUENCE OF MUSIC STUDENTS ATTENTION AND INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY Man is exposed to many phenomena of the environment.
  For all living organisms, including humans, sound is one of the effects of the environment.
 Throughout the history of mankind, his life has been accompanied by music.
Music is an art form whose artistic essence is a coordinated sound.
There are different genres of music nowadays.
  Criteria for such a division may be rhythm, instruments used, and techniques. Other parameters [6].
Appearing in the 50s, rock music was marked by suicides.
  Those who are obsessed with rock music are often compared to drug addicts, because those people can not give up rock music, rock is an addiction for them.
 Modern rock bands operate in the range of 80,000 hertz to even և 20 [.
As it is known, the frequency range of the sounds perceived by an adult is from 16-20 Hz to 16-20 kHz.
  This volume is typical for people up to 25 years old, then decreases year by year, and the elderly is 15 kHz [2].
The characteristics of rock music are heavy rhythm, monotony, pitch, high frequency, and light effects.
Rap is one of the main types of hip-hop genre.
 This type of music is close to the talk of the town; it developed in New York in the late 1970s.
 Rap is generally sung under heavy beats of music.
Pop music is a popular genre of music developed in the 1950s based on the rock 'n' roll style.
Many studies are being done in the modern world.
  The impact of music on the quality of human life մարդու health today is a priority in neurobiology, psychology, ևin general, in international medical scientific research, as well as the long-standing branch of music therapy as an effective treatment for many diseases.

  The effect of classical emotional music is well studied, gives experience in the processing of auditory information [10, 6], improves attention, perception of emotions [11, 6].
  Listening to classical music improves cognitive performance [12, 6].
  For this reason, when performing tasks, it is recommended to listen to background music - classical or melodic melody (Newberg A., Waldman M.).
  Music can improve memory և the ability to learn.
  Exercising with music increases the feeling of "vitality, which is right" in learning.
  Listening to light classical music (such as Mozart or Vivaldi) helps some students stay focused for a long time, but it can distract others.
The influence of music on various psychophysiological processes in Armenia is almost not studied.
  Based on the above, the aim of the work was to study the impact of different music genres on the attention and intellectual capacity of Vanadzor State University (VSU) students.
  Classical, heavy rock, pop և rap were chosen as musical genres.
1st to 4th year students studying in different departments were selected as the object of research.
  The test methods were selected for the study (Appendix 1), Kreppelin count (for determination of mental capacity) և Pieron-Ruzer (for concentration concentration determination) [7, 13].
162 students (17-22 years old) took part in the survey.
  For 67.9% of the respondents, music plays a very important role in life, for 27.2% it plays an important role, for 3.1% it does not have a very important place, 1.2% are indifferent, and for 0.6% music plays a role in life.
  81.5% listen to music very often, 15.4% - regularly, 3.1% - rarely.
 63.8% prefer pop, 57.7% classical, rap 49.1%, rock 48.5%.
 58% of the respondents prefer to do the lessons accompanied by music, and 42% do not.
 Music helps to focus on 58% of respondents, 42% - no.
  86.4% of the mood depends on the music.
  When asked if students had any signs of aggression while listening to music, 66.7% answered yes, of which 18% mentioned rock music.
genre listening 4).
The crepelin counting method is intended for the determination of mental performance.
  Mental capacity is the ability to perceive և process information, a person's potential ability to perform certain tasks with maximum efficiency in a given period of time.
  Criteria for mental performance are memory, attention, and speed of information transmission.
 Students were provided with forms (Appendix 2), required to perform mathematical operations until the "end" signal was given (every 15 seconds after starting work), after which the operations had to be performed from a new line.
 The work was done both before listening to the song, as well as various musical compositions were played for 20 minutes each. Roser test.
 The tests were completed within 2 days. The first day was completed before the song was sung.
 When listening to classical և rap music genres, each genre was given a break of at least 45 minutes.
 The second day was completed while listening to pop և heavy genres.
 The Pieron-Roser test is designed to determine the level of concentration.
 Attention is the active state of awakening, which is characterized by the body's readiness to respond to the impulse ևExpress with the direction of mental activity with a certain objectification.
  Voluntary attention is conditioned by the development of an action plan for the determination of the goal [1, 2].
[14] The focus of attention is to be obsessed with the activity, to be immersed in it.
 The test shows geometric images, when you hear the "start" signal, you need to insert "+", "-", "." In the latter as soon as possible without errors. signs, nothing is placed in one image.
  The test number is given in 60 seconds (Appendix 3.4).
The efficiency factor (K) was determined by the formula К = S2 / S1, where S1 is the number of actions performed correctly in the first 4 lines, S2 is the number of actions performed correctly in the last 4 lines.
 The results are presented in Table 1.
  The closer the value of K is to 1, the lower the level of fatigue (fewer mistakes are made).

Figure 2. Students' concentration level before listening to music հետո after listening to selected music genres From the data in Table 1 և Figure 1, it follows that the efficiency factor (K) before listening to music was greater than after listening, that is, we can say: that different genres of music had a "good" effect reduced the level of fatigue (fewer mistakes were made).
 Tiredness had the lowest value (K is close to 1) when listening to rap, then the value of K increased accordingly to listening to heavy rock, pop and classical music.
According to the data in Table 2, Figure 2 shows that the concentration level before listening to music is 73, listening to classical music is about 73.5, listening to rap is about 75, listening to heavy rock is about 76, and listening to pop is about 77.
  In other words, we can say that the students' concentration has increased after listening to the music.
  Despite the results, the students reported that they felt weak and tired while listening to classical music, and some of them mentioned that they were overly relaxed.
  While listening to rap, one part became confused, aggressed, and the other part became active.
  Pop has stimulated activity, positive emotions in 80% of students, and hard rock - almost everyone's aggression, nervous disorder, students have tried to focus as much as possible on work - Do not listen to music.
As a result of the research, it becomes clear that classical music has a more "weakly positive" effect on students compared to other selected music genres.
  This is explained by the preferences of the students, as during the survey none of them mentioned the classic as their preferred genre.
  In the preferred genres, the vast majority did not mention narcosis, but compared to the classic, the most pronounced effect of rooknun on cognitive functions.
It is believed that this was due to the negative emotional state evoked by rock music, հետ overcoming that state quickly, which forced the test tasks to be performed more quickly.
As a result of the performed analyzes we can conclude that: 1. All selected music genres influenced the students' intellectual ability և attention.
2. The genre of pop-rap music genres caused the greatest change in cognitive functions.
3. Classical music has caused fewer changes in cognitive functions.
4. The influence of different musical genres is personally conditioned by his age and preferences.
