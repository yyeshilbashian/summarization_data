AROUND THE DEMOGRAPHIC IMAGE OF THE DIASPORA ARMENIANS The Armenian Diaspora was formed as a result of the genocide and deportation, when hundreds of thousands of people were forced to find the right to live abroad.
  As a result of the crime, about 1 million people emigrated from Western Armenia and found themselves in a desperate situation.
  The first major issue was their settlement.
 According to the national delegations and political parties, "for the time being, it is best to keep the Armenian emigration in the neighboring countries and places of Turkey and Armenia.
  In this way, they hope that: (a) the migrants will take refuge in countries that already have Armenian colonies and provide financially facilitated;
The refugee Armenians hoped to return to their homeland.
  They were inspired by the existence of the First Republic of Armenia, the proclamation of a United Independent Armenia, the Treaty of Sword.
 However, they were to rise from the sovietization of Armenia and be buried after the Lausanne Conference.
  The latter even rejected the idea of ​​creating an "Armenian hearth".
  "Since then, the Armenians who have appeared on foreign shores have first of all started to ensure, develop and develop their economic and national existence, to take root in new settlements," says K. Dallakyan.
This is how the Armenian Diaspora was formed.
  It should be noted that, despite the long years of formation of the Diaspora, it arose with the simultaneous participation of thousands of Armenians. They were established in large groups in any place, which was a force for survival and identity.
Now there are Armenians in 190 countries of the world, the great Armenian poet H. Shiraz's word. "… That the moon is even familiar to the Armenian wanderer" 3.
Based on the existence of the Diaspora Armenians, which is conditioned by the socio-political, economic and cultural peculiarities of the host country, the communities of the Armenian Diaspora can be grouped according to the general characteristics of those countries: Armenian communities of East, West, South America and post-Soviet space4.
 We have considered the following. Eastern countries: Lebanon, Syria, Iran, Turkey, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Australia, Western countries: USA, Great Britain, France, Italy, Canada, Bulgaria, Poland, Hungary, South America 1 "Armenian History", vol. 4, book A, Yerevan, 2010, pp. 624-625.

And what is the Diaspora?
  We agree with V. With Saffron, who considers the Diaspora to be the migrant communities that (or their ancestors) spread from the homeland to foreign lands, have a collective memory, vision or myth about their true homeland, its physical location, history, achievements, they believe that it is impossible fully integrated there, so they feel partly alienated there, treat the ancestral homeland as their true ideal homeland to which they or their children must return; , which determines their solidarity - ethno-community consciousness 1.

When we look at the table, we see that in the 20th century. Intensive movement of Diaspora Armenians takes place in the second half.
  On the one hand, the Armenian communities of the Middle East are becoming thinner, on the other hand, the number of Armenians in Europe is increasing. 1, pp. 211-227.

The number of Armenians in Rica, that is, the movement of Armenians from the East to the West.
 According to a lecturer at Oxford University, scientist According to Dr. Hrach Chilingiryan, the Armenian population of Middle East in 1975 625 thousand decreased from a person և 2008 amounted to 320 thousand.1.
Reasons for the migration of Armenians from Middle Eastern countries to the USA, Canada and European countries Expert of "Noravank" Foundation Armenological Center V. Hovyan considers.1. Higher quality of life in Western countries.
2. Easy adaptation to the Western socio-cultural environment.
 Armenians, being Christians, more easily assimilate European "American socio-cultural morals" and, consequently, integrate more easily into those societies than Muslims.
  Their more intimate European-American socio-cultural environments are a stimulus for the Armenians of the Middle East to emigrate to the West.
3. The prevailing Islamic environment.
  It is somewhat foreign to Armenians.
  Despite the generally secular state և tolerance for Armenians, there have been no political or civil liberties in the Middle East that provide ample opportunity for Armenians to express themselves.
  This explains the political passivity of the Armenian communities in those countries.
4. Internal-external shocks: Arab-Israeli conflict, 1975-1990. Lebanese Civil War, 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, Iran-Iraq War (First Gulf War, 1980-1988), Iraq Invasion of Kuwait (Second Gulf War, 1990), Iraq-US War (Third Gulf War, 2003) 2.
All this H. Chilingiryan adds the intra-community issues that are connected with the three institutions: the Armenian Church, the Armenian school, and the Armenian-language press3.
 Diaspora Armenians prefer their own interests, not ignoring the other negative factors, we want to note the positive.
 The Diaspora Armenians do not feel obligated to any country, they are not ready to direct their efforts to its defense, that is, even if they lose the sense of Armenianness, they do not assimilate that someone else becomes a cosmopolitan.
  This circumstance preserves the opportunity to "convert" them and bring them up as Armenians.
However, we must admit that there is a problem of the Armenian feeling in the Diaspora.
  In particular, the 1983 issue of "Horizon" newspaper According to the information published in the "1981 Census of Canada" published in Ottawa on April 26 of the same year, 21 thousand people in Canada "recognize themselves as Armenians". man 4.
 When we put this number in the 70 thousand counted in Canada at that time. Next to the number of Armenians, there is a great danger of extinction.
  The situation is worse in Hungary.

About 2,500 people registered as Armenians in the elections of autonomy։ (600 were considered Armenians last year) 1.
Let us remember that 15 thousand people lived in Hungary in this region. Armenian.
These facts make us agree with A. With Ayvazyan's thought that Armenians by origin կան Armenians.
  In the first case, they do not have a sense of responsibility for the homeland, do not want to think about living in the homeland, do not want to be the bearer of the Armenian language, consciously or unconsciously reconciled with the inevitable assimilation and assimilation of their generations, that is, have no personal involvement in national life.
  Here we must remember the result of the study of the well-known American sociologist, Professor Louise Krisberg. "Belonging to a larger community gives a pleasant feeling. Being part of a self-sustaining group provides something like immortality.
  On the other hand, belonging to a group that lacks inner pride is detrimental to an individual's self-esteem. ”3
Armenians make up a small part of the population of the countries where they live.
  That number fluctuates within և within 1%, only in individual cases it exceeds 1%.
  Examples of such cases are Lebanon (2%) and Russia (1.5-2%).
  However, if they are united, they can present demands to those countries that protect the interests of their homeland.
  One such example is 1994. What happened in the USA.
  Thanks to the ARF Armenian National Committee of Western America, President B. Armenian-Americans responded to the Clinton administration's attempt to repeal a resolution banning US support for Azeris by sending thousands of telegrams to Washington (3,000 telegrams to White House and Democratic leaders), reminding them that repealing the resolution would greatly hurt the US president's favor among Armenians in California.
An abundance of copies of aid was recorded in 1988. After the earthquake in Armenia ժամանակ During the Artsakh movement.
  However, it should be noted that not everyone was interested in the situation in Armenia.
 When we look at the list of donations of the Hayastan All-Armenian Fund, it becomes clear that no more than two dozen Diaspora Armenians are concerned about Armenia, and with incomplete involvement.
  Standing above objective and subjective conditions, this shows the passivity of the Diaspora Armenians in the willingness to serve the homeland.
The next issue is the dynamics of the growing number of Diaspora Armenians.
 The data in the table shows a decrease in the growth rate of the number of Diaspora Armenians.
  Thus, if the number of Diaspora Armenians in the example of about 20 countries in 1980-1960 It more than doubled from 943,700 to 1,965,500, then increased by about 13% over the next 20 years (from 2000 to 1980) to 2,232,780.
 And this is in the case when in the last decades the outflow of Armenians from Armenia has increased, the replenishment of the Diaspora.
 The last circumstance shows that the natural growth rates of the Diaspora Armenians have sharply decreased, or the rates of their assimilation have increased.

 Along with being scattered in the world, Armenians are spread all over the territory of the states.
  This circumstance reduces the possibilities of preserving their "Armenian identity".
  For example, how can an Armenian stay 162 thousand Armenians? population և 152 thousand Living in a country with a dominant element with 11 people, this is despite the fact that each center of the Diaspora builds relations with the homeland in a different way.
  In this sense, there is no similarity between the centers of the Armenian Diaspora. "
  As a result, we get dozens of images of Armenians.
  Here, the Armenians are growing in the sense that Armenianness is the basis of communication with everyone, which will be the basis of the unity of Armenians in the diversity of the world.
The next phenomenon typical of Armenians is the high and growing dynamics of urbanization.
  Currently, 80% of Diaspora Armenians live in cities1.
  This is due to their occupation, the nature of their work.
The ratio of the number of Armenians living in Armenia to Diaspora Armenians has also changed.
 1970 36% of the world's Armenians lived in Soviet Armenia.
  2001 According to the data, that number has decreased, making 32% 2.
  Currently 25-30% of Armenians live in Armenia.
 This is a result of the low birth rate registered in Armenia in the post-Soviet period երի the outflow of Armenians from Armenia.
  As a result of the latter, the existing communities are filled, as new communities and a new Diaspora are formed.
 On the one hand, this means deepening the dispersion of the Armenian forces, on the other hand, it refreshes the memory of the former Diaspora members, delays and complicates their assimilation.
 The picture of the distribution of Diaspora Armenians by world regions has also changed.
 During the formation of the Diaspora, the number of Armenians in Asia was large.
  1926 74% of the Armenians of the whole world lived there (excluding those living in the territory of the Soviet Union).
  However, this number has gradually decreased.
 1970 The championship belonged to America, which increased in 2001. It made 54.1%, that is, more than half of the Armenians living outside the former Soviet Union lived in America.
  2001 According to the data, Europe was in the second place with 31%, and Asia fell to the third place with 12%.
In Asia, the Diaspora Armenians were concentrated in the territory of the Soviet Union, where the Armenian population in 1970. According to the data, it was 72% of the Armenian population in Asia, 88% of which was in the Transcaucasian countries.
 This number gradually decreased in 2001. 69% of all Armenians in the world lived in the former Soviet Union, 58% of which were in the Transcaucasian countries3.
Thus, the Armenians do not have a stable residence in the Diaspora yet.
 In addition to the movement from Armenia to the Diaspora, there are also movements in different directions within the Diaspora.
  Discovering the reasons for these movements, it becomes clear that the Armenians did not make any commitment to the country.
  At the same time, we must prove that a large part of it has been fixed in some state, has lost the Armenian self-consciousness.
