NEW CONCENTRATION OF CONDENSED PIRIDOTIENOPYRIMIDINES First mentioned in the scientific literature on tieno [2,3-b] pyridines in 1913.
  As it is known, the compounds of this series have a pronounced anti-shock, antibacterial and antibacterial effect.
 From a biological point of view, it was interesting to study the new derivatives of the compounds in this series և to study the relationship between their chemical structure աբանական biological activity, as well as their chemical structure։ activity.
 According to the literature, the development of the chemistry of thieno [2,3 b] pyridines, their combined derivatives, has led to the development of a number of convenient, efficient methods of synthesis.
  It includes two main approaches. Condensation of the thiophene ring on the basis of pyridine derivatives կառուց Construction of the pyridine ring on the basis of thiophene derivatives.
 The first approaches will be discussed in the presented work.
Based on the structure of the reagents considered as starting material, according to Thorpe, several main ways of constructing a thiophene ring can be distinguished.
 This synthesis approach must first be attributed to the cycling of substituted 2-alkylthio-3-cyanopyridines, which are traditionally obtained by electroceptor substituent containing 3-cyanopyridine-2 (1H) -ions (or corresponding thiolates) ո 1-14 alkylating agents.
 Advantages of this approach include: (a) the availability and variability of 3-cyanopyridine-2 (1H) ions, (b) the possibility of using the one-pot method, and (c) the possibility of high yields.
This transformation scheme is presented below: R, R1, R2 = Н, alkyl, aryl, cycloalkyl, amine, Hal; Z = CN, COMe, COPh, CONH2, CONHPh, CON (Ph) 2, CON alkyl, 4-MeC6H4CO, 4-MeOC6H4CO, 4-ClC6H4CO, CO2Et, 3-Cyanopyridine -2 (1H) - is the main factor influencing the cycling reaction of tions is the electroacceptor nature of the Z substituent, which determines the stability of the carbon.
  It has been experimentally confirmed that the range of activity of Z receptor substituents is as follows: The conditions for this reaction can change over a wide range of conditions.
  In general, the cycling reaction of 3-cyanopyridine-2 (1H) ions is carried out in the basic medium, acid catalysis is rarely used.
  The most suitable reagents are 10% aqueous KON / DMFA, as well as KON / ETON, K2SO3 / EtON, K2SO3 / DMFA t EtONa / ETON.
 Both excess and catalytic bases are used in these reactions.
The modified version of the above method is often used, ie the cycling of 3-cyanopyridine-2 (1H) ions is carried out without the separation of the intermediate 2 alkylthio-3-cyanopyridines, which in many cases allows to increase the output of the terminals [1-6, 8, 14- 22].
The next well-known, relatively common method for the synthesis of thieno [2,3-b] pyridines in the literature is based on the use of 2-halogen-substituted 3-cyanopyridines.
 The latter interact with thioglycolic acid derivatives in the basic medium.
 In the initial stage of the reaction, nucleophilic substitution occurs, followed by the formation of a thiophene ring under the influence of basic catalysis [3, 20].
R = alkyl; R1 + R2 = cycloalkyl; Hal = Br, Cl; Z = Me, Et, NH2, ClC6H4NH, Me2C6H3NH.
The starting material for the synthesis was 2,6-dichloro-3-substituted pyridine, the interaction of which led to the pyridine yield of the corresponding mono-substituted derivative.
  The latter reaction with the ethyl ether of mercaptoacetic acid և further cyclocondensation in the basic medium gave thieno [2,3-b] pyridines.
It was interesting to have a condensed pyridine ring in the resulting compound, for which we synthesized the synthesized end product with formamide.
In order to have a new substituent in the 4th position of the obtained pyrimidine ring, we increased the latter with chlorine-derivative with phosphorus oxychloride.
Subsequent substitution with ethanolamine resulted in a corresponding amino-substituted derivative.
Biological studies of the synthesized compounds showed that they also show weak anticonvulsant, antibacterial and antibacterial activity.
Experimental part.
 MMR 1H spectra were recorded with a "Varian Mercury 300VX" spectrometer at a frequency of 300 MHz DMSO-d6 / CCl4, 1/3.
 The spectra were removed with a "Nicolet Avatar 330 FT-IR" spectrometer in a layer of Vaseline oil.
