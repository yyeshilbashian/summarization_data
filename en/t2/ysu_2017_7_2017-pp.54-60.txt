Sci. Head: FM Ph.D., Assoc. R. Avetisyan Model description.
A model of human choice is considered, where as an object of choice is an object for the acquisition of which there is a "consumer-to-consumer" ratio of the money incurred.
  For example, if we consider the cost of purchasing food by a consumer with 1․000․000 significantly smaller unit assets (10 ppm) միջոց the means used in the case of a certain investment, we will see that the former is 0.001% of the consumer's assets, the latter - 10%.
  The higher the ratio, the more information a person "needs" before he or she acquires a product or completes an action (such as investing).
It is clear that the economic decisions made by people depend on certain restrictions.
  The limitations used in this model are information, disposable assets, income, credit availability, time և subjective human limitations21.
1. Information.
  Before making a decision, a person needs certain information that relates to the objects of decision-making.
  It is considered that certain expenses will be incurred in order to obtain unknown information (to find out the uncertainty or to dispel the subjective suspicions), in particular, money-time.
  Here the philosophical understanding of the relationship underlying this approach is considered to be the cost of due diligence.
  It is considered that the basis of human actions are opportunities, and the existence of limitations is the "volume" of opportunities.
Absence decreases or increases or assumes implementation. Managed assets, in terms of potential. Except for the person performing (Due diligence cost22).
 Proper prudence is a concept that refers to the necessary measures taken by a reasonable person before reaching an agreement to make a financial transaction with a second party.
Investments due diligence Investigations և Audit to verify all facts, such as financial statements և material adopted.
Some initiative is needed to obtain information that is available on the other side of the information.
 It is assumed that the person evaluates the received information on the basis of his / her previous experience of knowledge.
  The value և of the information received depends on the recipient.
Credit income ասանAvailability 23.
 In this model, in addition to income, other means owned by man are considered.
 The reason is that a person can use them to acquire other assets, in case his income is not enough.
  Certain expenses are incurred for the sale of the non-deductible asset.
  First, you need to spend some money in the form of commissions, and then spend some time before that asset is sold.
is that a person spends some time making the decision described in the model.
 Time is spent on obtaining information.
  It arises in the case of sale of less liquid assets.
 Time can be spent implementing the decision.
  For example, the purchase of an apartment, which leads to time costs associated with the registration of property rights.
4. Human internal limitations.
 As such, human preferences are considered, which, in fact, 22 Available here: http.
//www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp23 Credit access is understood as the amount of possible credit expected by a person3. Time.
  They are also supposed to be a limitation of 24.
  These can have a profound effect on a person's decisions.
It is considered that a person has certain preferences regarding the features of the object to be purchased.
 It is assumed that the degree of quality of the features may be different for each person.
 Assign (cid.
2010) (cid.
3037) the degree of the j-feature, where (cid.
2010) (cid.
3037) ∈ [0,1], how much (cid.
2010) (cid.
3037) is close to one, the more the feature is possible for a person, the more it has a greater influence on the decision made.
In addition to the fact that a person evaluates features according to their ability, he has preferences among the elements that make up a feature.
  Let y (cid.
2920) attribute is described (cid.

3037) (cid.

3037) (cid.
3041) in numbers.
 We will write it briefly like this: (cid.
1877) (cid.
3037) = (cid.
3419) (cid.
1877) (cid.
3037) (cid.
2869), (cid.
1877) (cid.
3037) (cid.
2870),…, (cid.
1877) (cid.
3037) (cid.
3041) (cid.
3423) Here y (cid.
2920) (cid.
2921) is a number: y (cid.
2920) (cid.
2921) ∈ [0,100], by which the human preference is classified y (cid.
2920) between attribute elements.
  For example, if y (cid.
Let 2869) denote the set of colors, և assume that the data subject prefers green over red, and red over white և, then y (cid).
2869) = {in the set 100,99.99,95,},, the first number will describe the color green, the second number - red, and the third - white և etc.
It is possible that the object has only a part of the attribute elements.
 To show it (cid.
1864) (cid.
3037) (cid.
3038) denote the presence or absence of the k-element of the j-feature in the possible variants (in the objects to be purchased).
 In this model, it is considered that the object can have only one of the attribute elements.
 Mathematically, this means that Suppose a person makes his choice among many objects.
  Each of these objects has a set of attributes that the other objects have.
24 It is assumed that the period observed in the model is not long enough to lead to a change in people's preferences.
  For this reason, preferences are accepted as unchanged in this model.

Consider the following example. There are 3 attributes - the object corresponds to those attributes - the elements (cid).

Let us now consider a function that describes the presence of an element in the j-attribute of an object.

In essence, for all attributes we get ․ (cid.

  The one that has the maximum usefulness will be chosen from the accepted options.
Again about the restrictions.
  Information, time, money և internal limitations of a person were considered.
  The latter conditioned the utility function.
 The first monetary cost is the cost of acquiring the property և accompanying costs (for example, state fees required for real estate ownership).
 Let us denote the monetary expenditure by M.
assumes the costs of obtaining information, which have a monetary expression 25.
The study of time expenditure within the data model concludes that it can also be measured in monetary terms.
 There is an alternative cost over time expenditure in the form of unearned interest income, which is expressed as a present value of the amount to be invested or discounted over a period of time (if the purchase process is completed at the same time, there is a discount problem).
25 The model assumes that information costs are certain predictable (expected) human costs that need to be met after an objective selection.
  And the initial selection is made on the basis of the features of the object, which are known in advance.
Registration of the rightInformation constraint on the Etienne model of other information activities I: information expenses, denominated assets, assets, income և credit availability, E, and interest rate: r (considered simple interest rate)

  That object is the consumer choice.
The model can be used if the differentiated products do not require time consumption or they are very small.
 In this case, the quantities describing time և information costs will be removed from the model.
