1805 Mohammed Ali has been appointed Governor of Egypt, whose administrative and economic reforms have significantly contributed to the socio-economic-political development.
  Muhammad Ali had a friendly attitude towards Armenians.
 According to historian Arshak Alpoyajyan, he "always loved the Armenians" and "encouraged them" because they were "a disinterested element" and "could serve the Europeans more usefully".
  In the conditions of religious tolerance, Armenians have occupied high positions in almost all spheres of the country.
 XIX century last և XX century. At the beginning of the 19th century, Armenians played a major role in the economic life of Egypt, successfully competing with their local and other minority counterparts.
 Armenians held prominent positions in the Egyptian Chamber of Commerce and European Affairs, which was the highest foreign trade body.
 The three successive nazirs of that divan were Poghos Yusufyan (1808-1844), Yakub Artin bey Chrakyan (1844-1850) եյ Arakel beyNubaryan (1850-1853).
 Also prominent was Stepan Bey Demirchyan (in 1855-1857 he headed the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs).
 Khosrov Chrakyan (1800-1873), Aristakes AltunTurri (1804-1858) and others also held state positions.
 Foreigners often called the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs "Pale Armenia" and praised the authority of Armenian figures: "Armenians have entered everywhere.
  "The Armenian community is the most powerful in the viceroy's court." [3]
1841 British diplomacy was able to achieve the resignation of Mohammed Ali, as a result of which a number of Egypt's foreign policy powers were reduced.
 In the middle of the 19th century, Egypt was partially under British colonial control.
  Nubar PashaNubaryan in 1857 Appointed Head of the Railway վարչ Transport Department, then four times Minister of Foreign Affairs (1866-1874, 1875-1876, 18781879, 1884-1888), then three times Prime Minister (1878-1879, 1884-1889, 18941895). .).
  He later became the translator and advisor of Ibrahim Ali, the son of Muhammad Ali.

Armenians mainly lived in Cairo and Alexandria.
 According to A. Gartashian, the Armenian colony of Alexandria was conceived during the French invasion [5].
  In 1891, Tigran Pasha d'Apro Bagratuni, an Armenian, was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs of Egypt.
    The Armenian community in Egypt has long been recognized by the local authorities as a caring community, granting the necessary privileges.
Until 1311 The Egyptian-Armenian church community was located in the Catholicosate of Cilicia, in 1311-1839 in Jerusalem, from 1867 in K. Under the auspices of the Patriarchates of Constantinople, and since the end of the 19th century, under the Catholicosate of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin.
Since 1885, there has been a widespread movement in the Egyptian-Armenian community in defense of the reforms to be carried out in Western Armenia under Article 61 of the Berlin Assembly.
 The working classes of the community and the rich are facing this issue.
  At the time, a number of start-ups were demanding protests against underperforming reforms.
  One of those companies was the "Progress Lovers" union, which was initially connected with M. With Portugalyan "Union of Masses of Armenia".
 The latter's struggle intensified in Alexandria in connection with the publication of the "Nile" weekly.
  The struggle of the Conservatives and the "Progressives" had led to the intervention of the police.
 Eventually, they managed to imprison the leaders of the Progressive Party through the government and shut down the Nile weekly.
It should be noted that since the beginning of the 20th century, the political orientation of the national parties operating in the Egyptian-Armenian community was Western European in accordance with the interests of the Western bourgeoisie.
 The reorganized Hnchakyan, Armenian Constitutional Ramkavar and Dashnaktsutyun parties, instilling illusions about the principles of freedom and justice proclaimed by the Turkish bourgeoisie, did not advance the question of Armenia's independence, but were satisfied only with internal autonomy.
During the Balkan war, intra-community life became more active.
1912 The representatives of the Armenian community of Egypt (E. Aghaton, Tigran khan Kelekyan, Vahan Malezyan, Arakel Papazyan, Leon Mkrtichyan, Vahan Zardaryan and others) wrote a letter to the Catholicos of All Armenians. (Tsar of Russia, kings of England and Italy, emperors of Germany և Austro-Hungary, presidents of France և USA).
 1913 The end of the Catholicos of All Armenians arrives in Cairo in January 2012, by which Poghos Nubar is appointed Catholicos delegate (later the National Delegation was established).
During World War I, the Egyptian-Armenian community made an invaluable contribution to supporting Armenian migrants and volunteers.
  Right at the beginning of the war, the Armenians of Cairo and Alexandria sent 20,000 rubles to Tbilissi (Georgia), then the "National Interests Protection Fund" was established through the efforts of Poghos Nubar. 15 60,000 rubles were sent to Etchmiadzin.
 According to some information, until 1915. According to the events, 20,000 Armenians lived in Egypt and Abyssinia.
  The Armenian General Benevolent Union was established to support the Armenians (founded on April 15, 1906 in Cairo on the initiative of national figure Poghos Nubari, prominent representatives of the Egyptian-Armenian community).
 The Armenian Red Cross (1915, Alexandria) was established.
 1915 In December 1945, French-British ships, seeing the inscription of the heroic self-defenders of Musaler "Christians are in danger", came to the rescue and transported 4058 self-defending Armenians to Port Said, where many later joined the French (Armenian) Legion.
1919-1923 A popular uprising in Egypt shook the foundations of British imperialism.
 The anti-British uprising of 1919 left its mark on the further development of Armenian-Egyptian relations.
  As a result, Armenian kiosks and shops were looted ․ They broke into apartments and massacred a number of Armenians. [7]
 In 1922 Egypt was proclaimed a constitutional monarchy.
 On March 15, Fouad became King of Egypt, and a year later, in 1923. On April 19, 1945, the Egyptian constitution was published, giving national minorities the right to conduct their own inter-community affairs.
1920 In November, Andranik traveled to Egypt, Alexandria, and then Cairo for two months to raise money, receiving a warm welcome from Egyptian-Armenians.
  Afterwards, Andranik went to Port Said, got acquainted with the life of the Armenian legionnaires in the Armenian tent city [9].
  The establishment of the Armenian Relief Committee chaired by the All-Armenian poet Hovhannes Tumanyan (founded in September 1921 in Yerevan) was an exceptional event in the life of the Armenian people.
 The task of the AOC was to help the hungry population of Mother Armenia, to support the construction, to establish close ties with the Armenian deportees scattered all over the world, to unite them around the homeland.
 The Egyptian AOC was formed in 1926. was born on February 28 in Cairo.
  World War II was a major event that changed the current state of affairs in international relations, in the world in general.
  1943 The Egyptian-Armenians took part in the fundraiser organized in favor of the "David of Sassoun" tank.
 All sections of the society, as Egyptian-Armenian writer, publicist Garnik Svazlyan writes. "The fathers of a family fighting for aur's bread spontaneously paid their dues."
It should be noted that the establishment of the Egyptian-Armenian National Council had an exceptional significance in the life of the Egyptian-Armenians.
 The council was established in Cairo (October 11, 1945, chaired by Al. Sarukhan) and Alexandria (December 12, 1945, chaired by S. Shahpaz, with the membership of H. Galenyan, T. Seferyan, Hambar Davt, G. Svazlyan and others). with the unification of national councils, supported by the Ramkavar-Azatakan and Hunchakian parties.
  The goal of the Egyptian-Armenian National Council was: "1) demand the attachment of Kh. The Armenian states of Armenia confiscated by Turkey, which are also specified in the Syrian treaty.
2) Be an advocate of immigration ս support it.
3) To unconditionally hand over the defense to Kh. Armenia that will enjoy the Council. The ... defense of the Union.
4) Establish cultural and patriotic ties with the Motherland, etc. [7].
One of the important steps taken by the Egyptian-Armenian National Council was 1946. The memorandum sent to the UN session, where the just demands of the Armenian people were presented in four languages ​​(Armenian, Arabic, English, French).
The Egyptian-Armenian National Council functioned until 1948, when British imperialists began to persecute the national liberation forces.
From the beginning of the 1950s, the Egyptian-Armenian community began to decline, inevitably leading to a decline in the community's potential, as well as a degree of integration into Egyptian society.
  The July Revolution of 1952, organized by Gamal Abdel Nasser and his supporters, overthrows the Egyptian government.
  During the reign of Gamal Abdel Nasser, many Armenians left Egypt.
The years of Anwar al-Sadat's presidency (1970-1981) were a turning point for the whole historical process of Egypt, as well as for the Egyptian-Armenians' life and activities.
 The above-mentioned emigration of Egyptian-Armenians was more or less prevented by Sadat's "open door" policy.
 It gave an opportunity to business people, including Armenians, to stabilize their economic situation to some extent.
  According to some data, in 1974 the number of Armenians in Egypt was a little over 10 thousand.
  In the very first years of Sadat's presidency, the Egyptian-Armenian national authorities succeeded in securing the return of their national lands, as evidenced by messages from the Cairo presidency.
  This historic period of the Armenian community in Egypt ended on October 6, 1981, when Egyptian President Sadat was assassinated during a military parade in the suburbs of Cairo.
 Despite the pro-Armenian policy of the Egyptian authorities, particularly Sadat, Armenians continued to emigrate, which was facilitated by the 1970s. Late և The tense political situation in the country in the early 1980s.
Egypt was one of the first countries in the Arab world to recognize the independence of the Republic of Armenia in 1991.
 After the achievement of the independence of the Republic of Armenia, the Armenian-Egyptian relations entered a qualitatively new stage, which provided many opportunities for both bilateral and multilateral cooperation. [13]
 1992 Diplomatic relations were established between the two countries on March 9, 2006.
  In September of the same year, the first diplomatic mission of the Republic of Armenia in the Middle East was opened in Cairo.
  As Perch Terzian rightly noted in his book "Genesis of the Armenian Embassy in Egypt", of his ability or benevolence ”[14].
The embassy is located in the Zamalek Island district of Cairo, where the embassies of many other countries are located.
 1993 The Egyptian embassy has been operating in Yerevan since April 2010.
  In 1992, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Armenia Raffi Hovannisian left for the Arab Republic of Egypt, met with a number of political figures. The Agreement on the Establishment of Inter-Diplomatic Relations between the Republic of Armenia and the OSCE was signed on March 9, 2006.
 This visit was preceded in 1992 by the Deputy Prime Minister of Egypt Kamal al-Ganzouriats to Armenia.
  1992 In May, the first President of Armenia Levon Ter-Petrosyan paid a state visit to Egypt, met with President Hosni Mubarak, Foreign Minister Amro Moussa, and, of course, representatives of the Egyptian-Armenian community.
 Within the framework of the official visit in 1992 The agreement "On Economic-Scientific-Technical Cooperation between the Republic of Armenia and the OSCE" was signed on May 27, 2006.
 Thus, the "Egypt Image" of the newly independent Armenia begins a heated cooperation in the political, economic, cultural and scientific spheres, continuing in the following years.
In fact, the role of the active activity of the Egyptian-Armenian community, its prominent representatives, as well as the centuries-old Armenian-Egyptian friendship in the development of the Armenian-Egyptian interstate relations is undeniable.
  The Armenian community of Egypt is still active in pro-Armenian activities, remembering the bright and powerful episodes of the past.
  Thus, each community that is part of the Armenian Diaspora must carry out Armenia-centered purposeful and organized activities in the same way as the Egyptian-Armenian community.
  Therefore, the activity of this community, which is of exceptional importance in the Armenian reality, is an instructive example for the organized Armenian community և cultural center, where all the components of the Armenian identity և national identity were developed պահպան preserved over time.
