Sci. Head: Doctor of Technical Sciences, Prof. A. Sargsyan The history of winemaking in Armenia is almost as old as that of viticulture.
  The word "wine" originated from the Indo-European proto-language.
  From the beginning, this word was used to describe a drink made from grape juice.
1 The main wine-producing regions in Armenia are Ararat, Armavir, Aragatsotn, Syunik and Vayots Dzor marzes.
 The Ararat plain is the largest wine-making region. 60% of the country's grapes are grown here.
  Grapes grown in this region contain aromatic components աքար sugar, which determines the unusual taste of grapes.
  There are about 30 soil types in the Ararat valley, as a result of which the same variety of grapes grown on different lands has different flavors.
Currently, there are 43 wineries in Armenia.
 70% of Armenian wine is exported to CIS countries, and the rest to US-EU countries.
 The development of entrepreneurship in the RA wine market is one of the most important factors in the balance of the foreign trade turnover of the country's food products, the improvement of the macroeconomic indicators of the republic, the overcoming of poverty in rural areas.
  The latter demands the discovery of obstacles to the development of the wine market, the increase of competitiveness, the introduction of policy directions for the solution of the viticulture, the traditions of the viticulture sector, the comprehensive situation, and the introduction of policy directions for their solution.
The change in production volumes in the market of alcoholic beverages is clearly reflected in the table below.

Table 1. Change in the volume of production of alcoholic beverages in the Republic of Armenia in 2010-2014 1 (thousand liters) Product Name Grape Wine Champagne Cognac Vodka-Vodka-Liqueur Beer .
 2010-2014 30,723 thousand liters of grape wine were produced.
  2015 2022.3 thousand liters were produced in Armenia in January-November, instead of 5127.8 thousand liters in the same period of the previous year.
Armenia ranks 68th in the list of 70 wine-consuming countries.
  This is a very low index, if we take into account that one of the ancient cradles of winemaking, Areni, is located in Armenia.
 Meanwhile, Armenia is in the top three in the list of countries that consume alcohol.
  16 liters of alcohol per capita in Armenia.
 According to official statistics, 1.25 liters of wine and 220 grams of brandy և 5.8 liters of vodka are used per capita per year.
  It should be noted that the situation is exactly the opposite in countries with large wine production. More wine (more than 50 liters per capita) is consumed than vodka.
  For comparison, 5.5 liters of wine are consumed annually in Russia, 15 in the Scandinavian countries, 21.5 in the Philippines, and 23.5 liters in Singapore.
 Thus, just because we Armenians prefer wine to vodka, we can have a noticeable increase in wine production and consumption.
Increase in wine consumption in Armenia in 2015 2014 compared to 31% in 2000. compared to 12%.
  Consumption volumes have increased 2.3 times in the last 10 years.
The main markets for the sale of wine products are the CIS countries, first of all the Russian Federation, then the Republics of Belarus and Ukraine, and wine from other countries is relatively consumed in the United States.

The RA wine market is characterized by fierce competition, where in order to assess the competitive position of organizations, it is convenient to assess the volume of their achievements (grape procurement) and their change.
According to the RA legislation, none of the wine companies operating in the Republic of Armenia has had a monopoly position, but some companies have a dominant position.
  Thus, "Yerevan Brandy Factory" CJSC and "Great-Valley" JV LLC had a dominant position.
  However, together with the mentioned companies, "Yerevan Brandy-Wine-Vodka Combine Ararat" OJSC was also the leader.
 Great Valley LLC (4.16%), Proshyan Brandy Factory LLC (11.07%), MAP CJSC (4.16%), Samko also had a leading position in the market of raw material purchases. LLC (4.07%), "Kaghtsrashen Winery" LLC (4.27%).

1 Have a negative impact: 1. Reduction of local traditional varieties in the grape variety structure, which is the raw material base of winemaking.2. Unfavorable climatic conditions for viticulture in certain years.3. Low level of capacity utilization of winemaking companies.4. Inefficiency of marketing and advertising activities. The need for technological upgrading of wine companies in the field of winemaking. The main ways of development are: 1. Agro-technical improvement of grape selection, garden cultivation.2. Production of virus-free planting material ներդր Introduction of effective disease control techniques, testing of high quality varieties.3.
