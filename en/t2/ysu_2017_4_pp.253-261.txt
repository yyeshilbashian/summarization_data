RATING OF HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS OF THE CIS COUNTRIES One of the most important tools for ensuring transparency in the education system is the ranking of universities, which provides comparable and open information about universities in different countries.
 The ranking of universities is one of the important directions of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA), within the framework of which it is planned to introduce a unified ranking system.
  It will allow to consider the different educational institutions from different countries in a comparable field in a common educational field.
 This is evidenced by research conducted by the European University Association (EUA) 1.
  According to the latest international agreement on this classification, the Berlin Principles (Berlin principles IREG-2006) 2, developed and approved by the UNESCO European Center for Higher Education, the Washington Institute for Higher Education Policy, 2004. Founded by the International Expert Group as a Basic Principle for Comparative Research in National Higher Education Systems.
 According to these principles, there are currently more than 20,000 universities in the world.
 These principles are: • University rankings should have a clear methodology used in the classification, • have matching indicators, • have separate coefficients that are present in different indicators, • have a clear presentation of ranking results, • pay attention to ethics criteria, • use as much as possible only verified data, Assosiation, 2011, 2013.

Classifications are grouped on the basis of different principles and forms: purpose, units of measurement, presentation of results, intended effect, etc.
The first national university ranking was conducted in the USA in 1983 in "US News & World Report" 3 magazine.
Historically, the creation of ranking systems was based on the provision that they will enable to measure the efficiency of universities.
 The prevailing opinion was that high-ranking universities are more effective, provide higher quality education, research practice, as well as more benefits in terms of educational services provided to the public than institutions with lower ratings.
  However, analysts often point out that the three main functions of universities - education, scientific research - educational services provided to the public, can differ significantly in their quality.
There are national and international types of ratings, which differ from each other by certain criteria.
 One of the differences is that national classifications are more often used and governed by local governments.
  They tend to inform the students of the given country about the best study opportunities in their own country.
  International classifications consider universities on a broader level, whether international or regional.
The International Ranking period began in 2003 with the Academic Ranking of WorldUniversities (ARWU) by the Shanghai Jiao Tong University4.
 Then in 2004 the Times Higher EducationRanking (THE) classification of world universities was created5.
  Since then, University World 3 http.
//www.usnews.com.4 http:
//arwu.org/.5 http:
//timeshighereducation.co.uk/. Armenian classifications have appeared, the rating capacity has increased even more.
The aim of this research is to study the ranking of CIS universities in different classifications հ to raise the position of RA universities.
 Most of the organizations ranking the world's universities according to their rankings refer to the top 100-500 universities in the world, among which the Armenian universities obviously do not have their place at present, as there is no separate ranking of CIS universities, we consider it expedient to analyze "Interfax" Web Classification data և Find out the positions of CIS universities there.
Let us first refer to the "Interfax" classification.
  Interfax (Interfax Information Services Group) is one of the largest news, information-analytical groups in the CIS region. Ացնում Implements rating, financial analysis, data-seeking և presentation programs in various fields, published in 2013 by post-Soviet countries (CIS, Baltic countries և Georgia) ranking list of higher education institutions.
The methodology of compiling the university rankings used the methodological approaches of the British agency QS (Quacquarelli Symonds), which develops the world ranking of the leading universities.
 The structure of the rating consists of three components: educational, research and international activities of the university.
 The 405 most famous universities in the post-Soviet space were rated.
The ranking is headed by Moscow State University, Belarus State University is in the second place, and St. Petersburg State University is in the third place.
  Ki University is ranked 4th, and Vilnius University is ranked 5th on the list.
Yerjan State University is in the 11th place in the rating list.
 Tbilisi State University ranks 51st and Baku State University 61st among the universities in our region.
Here are the rankings of the top 10 CIS universities in that classification, where Yerevan State University shares the 9th place with "MIFI" National Nuclear Research University: 1. Moscow M. V. Lomonosov State University, 2. Belarus State University, 6 http.

Russian University of Friendship of Nations, 6.2. Moscow N. E. Bauman State Technical University, 8. Tomsk National Research University, 9.1. Yerjan State University, 9.2. MIFI National Nuclear Research University.
The other classification we have referred to is "Webometrics".
  The Cybermetrics research group, which is part of the Spanish National Research Council, conducts 7 Webometrics Ranking of World Universities rankings.
  The group started publishing such ranking surveys twice in 2004, twice a year, mainly in January-July.
Webometrics covers 20,700 universities around the world, mainly taking into account four indicators: • Presence - the number of indexed pages of the official website of the university. The data is collected on the Google search site. • Impact is the number of external links made to the university's official website from other resources. The data is collected from the most popular Majestic SEO8 և Ahrefs9 databases; • Openness - the number of documents available on the site in Adobe Acrobat (pdf), Microsoftpptx) format;
  Data is collected from Google Scholar և Scimago10 database.
The last one was published in January 2016, the new university world ranking report developed by "Webometrics" international company11.
  According to the published data, the highest rating in Armenia is 7 http.

//ahrefs.com/.10 http:
//www.scimago.es/.11 http:
//www.webometrics.info/en/Europe/Armenia. The university has YSU (2314th).
 In total, 37 universities from Armenia are included in the list.
Universities from all CIS countries are included in this report. Of the 2084 universities, more than 39 are headed by Armenian universities, led by Yerevan State University.
 The leading country in this list is Moscow VM Lomonosov State University, which is the 134th largest university in the world according to the January 2016 Webometrics classification.
  Yerjan State University is in the 15th place due to the superiority of the last index of the given classification, which measures the research capacities of the university.
  Referring to the "Interfax" classification, we should mention that among the CIS universities, Yerjan State University from Armenia shares the 9th place with "MIFI" National Nuclear Research University (Table 1).

University of Moscow V. M. Lomonosov State University of Moldova State University of Kyrgyz-Russian-Slavonic University Գ. Shchenkoyan University of Belarus State University In this list, Yerevan State University is 40th, 26 of the outstanding universities are from Russia, 9 from Ukraine, 2 each from Belarus and Kazakhstan.
The rating is used within the framework of the Eurasian integration processes, the vivid proof of which was made on April 12, 2016 in Moscow. The Council of the Association of Eurasian Universities, held at Lomonosov State University, 12 aimed to strengthen և develop educational and scientific cooperation between Eurasian universities.
 In particular, the representatives of educational institutions signed a memorandum on the establishment of the Eurasian Network University.
The representatives of the partner universities agreed to set up working groups for the international ranking of the universities, to jointly coordinate the work, and signed a corresponding protocol.
Thus, the position of RA universities among the universities of the CIS countries is quite high. YSU is in the top ten.
