Since independence, Georgia has been in a difficult political and economic situation, which was conditioned not only by the Georgian-Abkhazian-Georgian-Ossetian conflicts, but also by the struggle of the political opposition against the newly elected President of Georgia, which in 1991. the latter led to a civil war.
 In addition, F ․ Gamsakhurdia, unable to withstand the pressure of the opposition, left the country, asked for asylum in Azerbaijan, but, after being refused, came to Armenia and took refuge in the Ijan region3.
 Unlike his predecessor, the second president of Georgia Eduard Shevardnadze pursued a more balanced and comprehensive foreign policy. One of its first indicators was the establishment of good-neighborly relations with all neighboring countries, including Turkey.
Immediately after the collapse of the USSR, Turkey was the first in the world to recognize Georgia's independence in 1991. December 16 4.
 Diplomatic relations between Georgia and Turkey were established in 1992. on May 21.
 High-level meetings were held regularly between the parties5.

Turkish-Georgian relations develop on the basis of mutually beneficial principles ․ have a signed free access agreement 6.
  The two countries have a wide range of close cooperation: energy, economic, political, scientific, educational, cultural, etc.

According to Saakashvili, Turkey is a "friend" for Georgia and a "window to Europe" 1, according to Saakashvili.
During Saakashvili's presidency (2003-2013), several strategic projects were implemented between the parties: Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum gas pipeline, etc.2.
 In addition, the construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Akhalkalaki-Kars railway, which is part of the New East-West Silk Road, is underway, which was scheduled to be completed in 2012, but due to political and financial problems, it is still ongoing in Javakhk and Kars3.
2003-2013 A number of agreements have been signed between the parties, which are considered to be the driving force of Georgia's economic development.
 Thus, in 2006 An agreement on the construction of an airport was signed in Batumi, the management of which was transferred to the Turkish Tepe-Akfen-Vie (TAV) airline for 20 years4.
  According to the agreement, the construction of the airport was sponsored by the Turkish side.
 It will transport Turkish-Georgian goods.
 With the participation of the Presidents of Georgia, Azerbaijan and Turkey in 2007 The start of construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway has been announced5.
  2007 Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan took part in the Turkey-Georgia-Azerbaijan trilateral meeting in Tbilisi in February 2012, where the "Tbilisi Declaration on Common Regional Cooperation" and the "Joint Declaration on Mutual Understanding and Cooperation in the Energy Sector" were signed.
  Then in 2007 In November 2008, during the visit of Turkish President Abdullah Gul to Georgia, a free trade agreement was signed between the parties to avoid double taxation, which entered into force in 2008. November 1 to 7, and in 2012. On January 20, 2012, the parties signed an agreement on electricity trade in Tbilisi, according to which the Akhaltsikhe-Borka electricity transmission line was established8.
  The main goal of this agreement is to increase Turkey's influence in Georgia, especially in the predominantly Armenian-populated region of Javakhk, through the operation of a hydropower plant under construction.
 This, of course, is not in the national interests of the Republic of Armenia.
Turkey is one of the 10 largest investors in Georgia ․ 2010 As of now, Turkey's investments have amounted to about $ 113.7 million.
  In addition to investments, Turkey provides significant military assistance (both in terms of military equipment and financial assistance) to Georgia.
  Let us not forget that the strengthening of the Georgian-Turkish relations was stimulated by the tense Georgian-Russian relations.
  Even during the "five-day" Russian-Georgian war, Turkey was able to provide assistance to Georgia without "offending" the Russian Federation.
  Turkey, 2008 During the August 1945 Georgian-Ossetian, Georgian-Russian wars, occupying a neutral position allowed US warships to approach Georgia, provided 100,000 tons of humanitarian aid, and rebuilt 100 refugee camps in the Georgian town of Gori.
It is no secret that throughout history Turkey has wanted to conquer or keep Transcaucasia under its influence.
 Now Turkey continues its policy of gaining political and economic influence in the South Caucasus.
  Turkey, as a NATO member, seeks to strengthen in the region.

Turkish-Georgian military and military-technical cooperation started in 19921993, and the first military cooperation document was signed in 1997. in March.
 According to the latter, Turkish bases should not have been located in Georgia.
  About this in 1999. stated the then President of Georgia E. Shevardnadze, emphasizing that it may pose a threat to the long-term presence of Russian bases in Georgia1.
The other agreement was signed between the parties in 1997. in June on military education, and in 1999. A military cooperation agreement was signed in March 2012, according to which Turkish officers would organize training for Georgian servicemen, military police and border guards2.
  Moreover, in 1999 Turkey has also provided $ 1.7 million in military assistance to increase the combat readiness of Georgian border guards3.
 Under the guise of NATO, Turkey has been able to provide large-scale military assistance to Georgia.
  Only in 1998-1999. Turkey provided $ 9.3 million in military assistance to Georgia in 1999, including military, information facilities and equipment. within the framework of that program for the modernization of the Kojori training center of the Ministry of Defense.

1997-2007 60 RN-94 armored vehicles, 2 UH-1 Iroquois helicopters, 2,500 MP5A1 (K) submachine guns, 1,500 G3 A3 (A4) assault rifles, 500 T-40 assault rifles were imported from Turkey to Georgia. , 4000 pieces of 122MM missiles, 20,000 pieces of 155-MM missiles, 21.6 thousand pieces equivalent to 169.5 thousand dollars, size 12.7 x99 MM և 320 thousand pieces of 9x19 MM size bullets, a large number of grenades, anti-aircraft and grenade launchers, patrol boat "Kuta ("Turk" AB-30 project), communication and navigation equipment, radio equipment, 7 units of GPS satellite navigation systems, communication technologies, military equipment, several Land Rover vehicles, 10 units of diving equipment, military equipment, etc. technique 5.
 And in 2009 On July 25, 2012, Turkey handed over to Georgia new high-speed patrol boats, which had been pre-ordered by the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs6.
 In general, in 1997-2008. Turkey provided $ 45 million in military assistance to Georgia. The military turnover between the parties amounted to 3 million 350 thousand dollars7.
  Turkey probably continued to provide military assistance to Georgia in 2010-2012.
Besides, it is already being clarified that the cooperation of the Turkey-Georgia-Azerbaijan trio in the military-military-technical spheres gives significant results year by year.
 It received a boost at the same time as the launch of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, as problems arose to jointly ensure the safety of the pipeline.
  Turkey, Georgia "Azerbaijan planned to carry out military cooperation within the framework of GUAM" 8.
Georgian-Turkish relations are being further strengthened within the framework of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC).
  1992 The BSEC, established by 11 countries in the Gulf region in Istanbul on June 25, including Turkey, Georgia and Armenia, is an economic organization that aims to strengthen and deepen cooperation between member states.

Georgia's total trade turnover in 2005-2006 amounted to 899.7 million dollars.
Turkey is the fourth largest investor in the Georgian economy ․ In 2006, Turkish investments amounted to $ 127.08 million, which is 6 times more than in 2005. indicator 2.
 Already in 2007 The trade turnover between the parties under the Free Trade Agreement has quadrupled compared to previous years, amounting to about $ 830 million at the end of the year3.

 According to the Turkish Ministry of Economy, in 2012 Georgia's investments in Turkey amounted to $ 23 million, and Turkey's investments in Georgia amounted to $ 1.1 billion5.
Despite the Turkish-Georgian strategic cooperation, there are some differences between the two countries.
 It particularly refers to the problem of the Turkish Meskhetians.
In addition, Turkey wants to build a hydroelectric power plant on the Chorokh River, the operation of which causes serious environmental problems in the resorts of Adjara.
According to Manan Kochladze, chairman of the Green Alternative NGO, hydropower plants being built by Turkish companies on other Georgian rivers could lead to the destruction of 27 villages in Georgia and the flooding of more than 528 acres of fertile land6.
Some problems for Georgia are also caused by the 400-500 thousand 7 Abkhazians living in Turkey, who, if possible, raise the issue of Abkhazia and darken the Georgian-Turkish relations.
  The Abkhazians of Turkey, being united, are able to force the local authorities to take them into account, which in turn is unacceptable by the Georgian authorities.
2011-2012 Turkish-Georgian relations were strained when the issue of restoring a mosque built in Batumi in 1863, which had been destroyed during the Soviet era, was still being discussed.
  A significant part of the Georgian society negatively accepted that policy of official Tbilisi9.
  The Turkish authorities, in their turn, stated that if the issue of restoring the mosque is not resolved, the Georgian churches in Turkey will suffer the same fate.
  Tbilisi found itself in a difficult situation ․ in the pre-election year M. On the one hand, Saakashvili tried not to worsen relations with the Georgian Church, and on the other hand, to show his tolerance to the West and Turkey10.

The most difficult issue in Turkish-Georgian relations is the issue of the return of Turkish Meskhetians, according to the official Ministry of Economy.
 The Turks call them "Akhisk Turks" 1.
 1999 By becoming a member of the Council of Europe on April 27, 1944, Georgia undertook to provide The return of the exiled Turkish-Meskhetians 2.
  2007 On July 11, 1945, the decision was made to return the Meskhetian Turks to their homeland.
 The resettlement of Meskhetians in Javakhk poses a serious threat to both Georgian and Armenian national security, as it may change the demographic situation of Armenian-populated Javakhk, and the Muslim-populated Turkey-Adjara-Javakhk-Kvemo Kartli-Azerbaijan section will be formed.
 And in international organizations, the parties did not vote against the resolutions put forward by them, a vivid example of which is Turkey's reaffirmation of its position in 2008. At the 62nd plenary session of the UN General Assembly on May 15, 2006, where the Turkish representative spoke in favor of preserving Georgia's territorial integrity, he also abstained from voting in Resolution GA / 10708, without straining relations with both Georgia and Russia4.
Thus, in parallel with the development and strengthening of relations between the parties, there are many problems, which in one way or another do not allow to establish full "brotherly" and friendly relations or to keep what is strong, regardless of the will of the authorities.
Based on the research of the material, it becomes clear that the main reason for the strengthening and rapprochement of Georgian-Turkish relations is the new geopolitical developments in the South Caucasus, in particular, the deterioration of Georgian-Russian relations. the life of the gas pipeline.
 It is undeniable that Turkey, being one of the active and influential members of NATO, could not but be interested in the Georgian leadership, especially in the case that the latter has repeatedly expressed a desire to join NATO.
 In this regard, Turkey is a potential ally, as it has always supported Georgia's application for NATO membership and provided adequate assistance to the Georgian Armed Forces to meet NATO standards.
Anyway, Turkey always shows "good will" towards Georgia, supporting in various issues, without inflaming relations with Russia.
 Turkey has always been able to successfully get out of the dilemma situation without losing any of the parties.
  A vivid example of this is the Georgian-Russian "five-day" war ․ Maintaining neutrality, Turkey did not worsen relations with Russia, but at the same time managed to "flatter" the pro-Western leadership of Georgia by providing other types of humanitarian aid.
In conclusion, we should mention that there are both positive and negative elements in the Georgian-Turkish relations, which Armenia should use properly to make the Georgian side understand that the Republic of Armenia is a reliable ally for Georgia.
1 "Akhiska" is a Turkish name for the region in the south of Georgia, which became part of the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century and joined the Russian Empire in the 19th.
 At that time, the peripheral society of Georgia was assimilated to accept Islam, as ethnic Turks and Kurds settled there.
 1944 About 70,000-80,000 people living mainly in Adigen, Aspindza, Akhaltsikhe, Akhalkalaki and Bogdanovka (now Ninotsminda) were forcibly evacuated to Central Asia.
