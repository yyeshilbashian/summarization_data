THE PROBLEMS OF THE ARMENIAN CASE AHEAD OF THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE IN ARF "AZDAK" PERIOD After presenting the issue of defending the Armenian Cause in the international arena, it became a key issue of national ideology, and later the ARF Dashnaktsutyun Armenian National Committee was formed.
  The ideology of the Armenian Cause is based on the principles of unification of the Diaspora Armenians in exile in the territories of Western and Eastern Armenia, on the creation of free, independent, united Armenia.
The Armenian Cause has always been in the field of view of the ARF "Azdak" periodical, and on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the Armenian Genocide in 1965, various articles on the topic were published.
  The ARF official newspaper viewed the Armenian Cause in several layers, based on history and eyewitness testimonies, as well as assessing the position of the international community and anticipating the necessary steps.
Historical Overview.
  The newspaper presents Hay Dat, in particular, the preparation, implementation and consequences of the Armenian Genocide, based on historical data, as well as the studies of Armenian and foreign historians and lawyers.
  Instead of mechanical rewriting, the defects of the works are pointed out.
  For example, it is emphasized that one of the Soviet Union's historians, Academician Eugene Tarle, did not delve into the study of "Europe in the Age of Imperialism" to find out the Soviet government's guilt in "handing over Mustafa Kemal" 22, but in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia it is described in detail. the most destructive covenant for.
In order to find out the truth of the historical facts, the newspaper enters into a long-distance debate even with Turkish historians, providing the arena to Armenian specialists.
 The main objections are related to 22 See Tarle E. V., Turkey and the Armenians, "Azdak", January 12, 1965, No. 262, Samuel H., Turkey - the Armenians, January 13, No. 263.
23 "Treaty of Sevres through the eyes of the Soviets", "Azdak", 1965, February 24, No. 299.
Turkish historians have linked the chronology of events to Turkey's interests and linked the idea of ​​annihilating Armenians with the Armenian "rebellion" 24.
 Evidence is presented of Germany's role in the implementation of the genocide program and its silence in the press 25, citing 8 bulletins received from Armenian provinces, the Turkish Bulletin of the Assembly of Deputies, 1910. Talaat's speech at the Ittihad conference, German documents, state archives, court records and many other documents.
The Armenian Cause in the 1960s.
 The newspaper, proceeding from the geopolitical situation of the observed period and the issue of preserving the national image in the Armenian colonies, puts forward more realistic programs in pursuit of the Armenian Cause, offers to read the views of different intellectuals.
 Reflecting on the future of the Armenians, especially the Diaspora, "Azdak" raises the issue of preserving the national identity, avoiding the white massacre, using the unification of the Armenian schools of education around the church26.
  The periodical tries to make its contribution to making the Armenian culture accessible to the new generation of the Diaspora. He regularly publishes reviews of Armenian cultural and public figures, excerpts from their works, posts heroic episodes of history, discusses issues related to the Armenian language and literature27.
  A special role is reserved for educating young people who have attended foreign schools in the Diaspora press28.
 The expediency of creating an Armenological center is also voiced29.
"Azdak" is looking for possible factors contributing to the settlement of the Armenian Cause, analyzing the guarantees that have matured before that period.

In particular, the step of state adoption of the law on the recognition of crimes against humanity in France on the basis of a UN resolution on the basis of a UN resolution seems to represent the pro-Armenian statement of the Cypriot Foreign Minister at the UN30.
"Azdak" has its position on the issue of resolving the Armenian Cause.
 The idea of ​​presenting the Armenian question to foreigners with facts is not put forward mainly on an emotional level31.
  According to the newspaper, this mission can be undertaken by the new generation, which studies the history of its nation with an impartial approach, recognizing the Armenian Cause as a perpetual struggle against assimilation.
  At the same time, presenting the truth to foreign nations through foreign publications is considered a priority, counterbalancing Turkey's propaganda32.
  The newspaper considers the verification of the number of Armenians around the world as one of the practical steps proposed in the framework of the huge work expected on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, in order to have additional grounds for pursuing the Armenian Cause33.
The Armenian Cause, which existed before the genocide, is widely covered by the ARF Dashnaktsutyun official newspaper, referring to the land issue in the Karabakh, Nakhichevan and Akhalkalaki regions34.
 In this case, the periodical is not free from criticism of the Soviet Union.
 It is also referred to the unfavorable socio-economic conditions inside the country, which is not just an expression of the ARF Dashnaktsutyun's strong dislike of the Soviet regime, but an aspiration to have a united, powerful homeland in the context of the Armenian Cause35.
 The attitude of the ARF official newspaper towards Soviet Armenia is definitely not negative, as it enthusiastically records the repatriation of Diaspora Armenians36.
"Azdak" attaches great importance to the views of thoughtful leaders, historians, party members, public figures, and writers on the necessary steps towards the 50th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. 30 See "Crimes against humanity are inalienable", "Azdak", April 14, 1965.

The aftermath of the genocide.
  Confirming the importance of the factual material in the claim of the Armenian people, the periodical published data on the losses suffered by Armenian villages, churches and the number of victims.
 Azdak publicists tried to assess the material damage caused to the Armenians in order to outline the demands to be made by Turkey in case of recognition of the genocide.
  In particular, churches of civilizational significance were completely destroyed or looted.
 Fearing that Turkey might continue its plan to eradicate the remains of preserved churches, the need to compile a list of them in any way possible is put forward38.
  Citing secret state decrees, ambassadors' telegrams, Armenian Patriarchs' bulletins addressed to the Pope and travelers' notes, the newspaper's staff published data on the number of Armenian villages, churches and victims, and even estimated the total amount of the loss.
Eyewitness testimonies.
 "Azdak" tried to make the stories of the Armenians who escaped the Armenian Genocide heard by the public, to publish the testimonies of foreign public figures in the form of a newsletter.
 In particular, in the section under the newspaper, several issues are continuously provided by Y. Lepsius bulletin, his opposite impressions about Armenians and Turks40.
 The stories of the perpetrators of the atrocities of the Turks are sometimes written by themselves, sometimes by the employees of the presented newspapers (including foreign ones) 41.

Foreign press և Hay Dat.
  "Azdak" retrospectively asked both to present the approaches of the foreign press about the Armenian Cause and to counteract the falsification spread by the Turkish press.
 The situation described by the newspaper reminds every year, especially in 2015. Turkey's behavior.
 In particular, as the day of commemoration of the victims of the Genocide approaches, this country is looking for ways to minimize the impact of the 50th anniversary, taking into account the international interest.
Against the background of the publications of "Le Monde", "Figaro", "Boston Globe", "New York Times", "Observer" and other periodicals presenting factual data on the policy of extermination of Armenians, the Turkish press is trying to influence the world opinion.
"Azdak" studied and singled out the most insidious ways chosen for that purpose.
The Turkish press emphasizes the unity of Armenians and Turks, "warm" relations, calling to forget the bilateral losses43.
  In response, "Azdak" publicists cite the example of Turkey not forgetting the events in Cyprus44.
The coverage of the Western media, including the European, American and Canadian ones, differs from the pro-Armenian publications, in which, with an interesting regularity, the emphasis is on comparisons with Hitler's actions.
 The ARF periodical bypassed the "Times" review of the English author Lord Kinbos' book dedicated to Ataturk, which was banned from entering the country due to its recognition of Turkey's national interests45.
 The French "La Figaro" did not avoid mentioning that in 1915 The crime was the first in the 20th century46.
 And the radio և Canada ու radio and television broadcast widely the tapes prepared by the Central Committee for the 50th Anniversary of the Genocide47.
 In addition, The Le Monde Ն The New York Times reported on the failure of the Sword Pact, 42 Frunjian T., the 50th anniversary of the first genocide of the 20th century, and the Arabs.

At the same time, the role of the Armenian culture in the development of the world civilization was valued.
The publications of the Arab, especially Lebanese press are distinguished by their readiness to support the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the warmth towards the Armenians.
  They include the role of the Armenians in the development of various spheres in Lebanon49.
  And the Egyptian newspapers referred to how in 1915 to the massacres, as well as to the declaration of 1965 as a year of mourning and hope50.
Turkish diplomacy in 1965.
  The ARF periodical closely follows the Turkey-USSR relations, the position of the former on the Cyprus issue, seeing pleas with the Armenian Cause.
  The newspaper logically notes that the issue of Armenian lands has become a subject of trade in the hands of Turkey։ USSR, as 51 years ago51.
According to Azdak, the active initiative of the Soviet Union-Turkey agreement on trade relations shows that Turkey is entering a new phase in its relations with the USSR, while maintaining favorable relations with the West.
  As a result, the foundations for the settlement of the Armenian Cause were weakened, one of which was given by Stalin at the end of World War II, demanding the return of Kars and Ardahan from Turkey, where the Diaspora people were to be resettled.
 Meanwhile, N. Khrushchev stated that the USSR has no land claim from Turkey52.
 Azdak reproduces analytical articles in Arab newspapers covering Turkey's Middle East policy, the re-establishment of positive relations with the Soviet Union over Armenian lands under Ataturk, and the awakening of Kurdish-Armenian issues within Turkey.
 They also drew parallels 48 See “A Fifty Years of Cancer. The Massacre of the Armenians of Turkey "," Azdak ", April 28, 1965, No. 45," Armenia Remembers "Armenians are a cultural, intelligent, old tribe, says the New York Times, April 30, No. 47.

Among the "Armenian massacres" of the Turks' encroachments on the Balkan countries, noting that in both cases the Turks blame the other side54.
The situation of Armenians living in Turkey is within the framework of the ARF official newspaper.
 It reveals the government's indifference to the needs of the Armenian community, describes the isolated way of life of Armenians in different cities of Anatolia, and even succumbs to the pressures of conversion55.
Mention and appreciation of programs dedicated to the 50th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide.
  "Azdak" referred to the commemorative evenings, protests, lectures organized by Diaspora Armenians in the Armenian colonies, drawing attention to the initiatives of the Armenian communities from Beirut to Paris and Washington.
Moreover, the newspaper contributed to the public awareness of the pan-Armenian events, inspired the Armenians of the Diaspora to contribute to some fundraisers or demonstrations56.
  Thus, "Azdak" becomes a bridge between Armenia and the "Armenian communities existing in all corners of the world", uniting their initiatives around one idea and transmitting the spirit of unity57.
1965 և Today's Diaspora Armenian press, of course, differs in structural, linguistic, genre aspects, as journalism develops along with life.

not by the example of an interesting hero or by a combination of expert opinions.
 In the case of incidental materials, sometimes a record of uninteresting details is made, giving the material an official lifelessness.
When referring to the aftermath of the genocide in a historical overview, the staff of "Azdak" shows the consistency of using several sources to suggest a sequence of steps.
  Meanwhile, in the articles on the current status of the Armenian Cause and the new generation, they do not look beyond the tragedy, as a result of which the article turns out to be full of emotional-rhetorical questions.
Thus, one can learn from the publications of "Azdak" newspaper about 1965. On the eve of the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, to highlight the political and ideological aspects of the newspaper on the Armenian Cause after the mood in the Diaspora.
  They provide an opportunity to learn about history and learn lessons, as Turkey's policy towards the international community has not changed significantly in 50 years.
  These days, the ARF official newspaper presents more clearly its ultimate goal - the most important steps to achieve it.
