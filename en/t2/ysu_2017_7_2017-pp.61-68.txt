Science ․ Head: ف․م․ Ph.D., Assoc. R. Avetisyan Plato warned the 5th rulers in Athens about the danger of extreme inequality.
 "There should be neither extreme poverty nor excessive wealth among the citizens," Erna writes, "both of which are the cause of great evils."
In this study, the Gini coefficient for measuring income inequality will be considered, as well as related concepts.
The Lorentz curve was proposed by the American economist Max Otto Lorentz in 1905 as an indicator of population income differentiation2.
The Gini coefficient, or Gini index, is the degree to which the distribution of household incomes is statistically deviated from the perfect equation3.
Using the Lorentz curve, we can calculate the coefficient of 4.

All calculations by Pietra were performed using the obtained interpolation multiplier.
In this context, it is suggested to calculate the "contribution" of individual groups in the Pietra indexing process.
  In the example, the net "contribution" of each group to the Pietra index is singled out, which is presented in the third column.
  The calculation was made by subtracting the deviation of the previous group from the current group.
 For example, for the fifth group we will have: L (25) -L (20) = 17,24-14,54 = 2,99.
The resulting coefficient, Maximum deviation ∗ 100%, indicates the weight of individual groupsNet deviation

  Moreover, the calculation is made by presenting the area of ​​the first as the sum of two areas, the area before the point of maximum deviation (where the Pietra index is registered) and the area after that.
See the results in Table 2.
The results show that ․ • The area before the maximum deviation point is larger than the area after it.
 The latter means that the groups with lower incomes than the average income have the largest share in the integration of Gini.
• Having the Gini coefficient calculated on the sample data և The Gini coefficient calculated by the interpolation polynomial representing the Lorentz curve, we can find the value of K in the remainder of the interpolation.
