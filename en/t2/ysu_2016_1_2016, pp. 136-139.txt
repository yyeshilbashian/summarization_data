ASYMMETRIC SYNTHESIS OF ENANTIOMERICALLY ENRICHED INSATIENTLY CONNECTED CONTENTS The literature is known for a limited number of acetylene-containing amino acids, which are mainly detached from cells [with fungal isolates]
 For example, Streptomyces catenula (S) -2-aminobuty-3-acid (propargyl glycine) isolated from fungi inhibits the activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae և Escherichia coli cells, acts as an inhibitor of amylase synthesis] It is part of the antimicrobial drug FR 900130 [3].
New Guninea (S) -2-aminohex-4-acid isolated from fungi is considered an AED inhibitor [4], and Euphoria long-separated (S) -2-amino-4-methylhex-5-acid և (2S, 4R -2-amino-4-hydroxyhept-6-acid show antimutagenic activity [5] և et al.
Previously, enantiomerically enriched (non-protein-enriched) S-enriched in many enantiomerically (non-enriched) S asymmetric synthesis [6-9].
 In all cases, the chiral macrostructure of nickel complexes provided high stereoselectivity, which could be expected when using a similar structure of propargylglycine (NiII- (S) -BPB- (S) -PGly) complex.
In the present work, the optically active non-protein amino acid (S) -2-amino-2- (4-fluorobenzyl) pent-4-amino acid was synthesized by alkylation of the NiII- (S) -BPB- (S) -PGly complex.
  The NiII- (S) -BPB- (S) -PGly (1) complex was synthesized by a previously developed method [10].
  4-fluorobenzylbromide (2) was taken as the alkylating agent.
The alkylation reaction has been studied in various media: DMF / NaOH, CH3CN / NaOH, CH3CN / K2CO3 both at room temperature and under heating.
  However, the best results were obtained in the DMF medium in the presence of NaOH at 600C (Figure ․ 1).

The Argasik complex (3) was separated from the reaction medium by precipitation from water and crystallization from methanol վել characterized by physicochemical analysis methods (see experimental section).
The absolute configuration of the amino acid residue of the basic diastereomeric complex (3) α was confirmed by polarimetric measurements at a wavelength of 589 nm.
  The positive value of the optical rotation of the diastereomer complex indicates its (S, S) absolute configuration.
  The diastereomeric excess of the major diastereomer complex was determined by chiral BAHC analysis.

  1H-MMR spectra were removed on a Merkury-300 Varian NMR (300 MHz) spectrometer (Yerevan, Molecule Structure Research Center, NAS RA).
  The value of optical rotation was measured on a "Perkin Elmer-341" spectropolarimeter.
 The optical purity of the amino acid was determined by chiral high sensitivity liquid chromatography (HPLC) on the "Waters Alliance 2695 HPLC System" device (Yerevan, "ArmBiotechnology" SNCO of NAS RA.
 Melting temperatures were measured with an "Elektrothermal" device.
