 It can play an important role in the energy technology of the future.
 The use of Escherichia coli bacteria in mixed fermentation is a new approach in the biotechnology of molecular hydrogen (H2) production, offering efficient hydrogen production from renewable sources.
Molecular hydrogen (H2), as an alternative և renewable source of fuel, is of great interest because it emits up to 142 kJ / generation [1], just as it is an environmentally friendly fuel, as its combustion releases water.
  During oxygen fermentation (when there is no external electron receptor), E. coli produces mixed carbon fermentation using glucose as an external energy source of carbon.
  As a final product, formic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid and ethanol are produced [2, 3].
Special enzymes are involved in hydrogen metabolism - hydrogenases (Hyd), which are responsible for the production of hydrogen, on the contrary, for oxidation.
 Four [Ni-Fe] (1-4) Hides have been found in E. coli, which are synthesized under different physiological conditions and encoded by the operators hya, hyb, hyc, and hyf, respectively [4, 5, 2].
 Hydrogenases are enzymes involved in ion transport by bacterial membranes that can interact with the proton FoF1 AEFase [6, 2, 3].
  In the E. coli bacterial membrane, there is a vital H + / K + pump for bacteria, consisting of proton transporter FOF1 AEPH և potassium ion transporter TrkA system.
 It has been shown that formic acid hydrogen lyase complex participates in the transfer of energy inside the pump, providing redox equivalents [7, 6, 2].
The activity of HID depends on the environmental conditions, from the substrate to its concentration, pH, redox, redox potential.
  In E. coli, there is evidence that the Hid-3 enzyme is primarily responsible for the production of H2 by E. coli; it is active at low pH values, while Hid-4 is in neutral և weakly ground conditions.
  It has also been shown that glucose has a suppressive effect on hyf gene expression.
  However, the mechanism of the suppressive effect of glucose on Hid-4 is not yet clear.
  Hid-4 has subunits that can transport protons through the membrane.
  This assumption, Sky, still needs to be proven.
Glucose levels in the E. coli bacterium have been shown to affect Hid-4 activity by altering the interaction of the proton FoF1 with AEPH.
JRG3621 (hyfB-R) mutant strainResearch objects և methods.
  The natural isogenic strain of E. coli facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacterium BW25113 was used for the studies և [6].
Bacteria were grown under anaerobic conditions with a medium / test volume ratio of 1.
1․25.
 Oxygen from the liquid medium, nitrogen, was previously removed by steam removal in tubes sealed with rubber stoppers.
  The bacteria were grown for 18-22 hours in a Wise Cube 32 thermostat at 37 ° C [9, 6].
 Bacteria were grown in liquid media containing 20 g / l peptone, 15 g / l K2HPO4, 1.08 g / l KH2PO4, 5 g / l NaCl (pH7.5) or 20 g / l peptone, 1.08 g / l K2HP O4.15 g / l KH2PO4, 5 g / l NaCl (pH5.5).
Bacteria were isolated from the medium at 5000-6000 rpm for 10 minutes by centrifugation (R g tina 420 R or PC-6).
 The resulting residue was washed twice with distilled water and centrifuged again under the same conditions.
 The 0.5 ml volume of bacteria was then transferred to 4.5 ml of experimental solution containing 200 mM trisaminomethane, 1 mM NaCl և KCl, 0.4 mM MgSO 4 [9, 6].
The redox potential was determined with an accuracy of 0.1 mV: I-160MP type potentiometer (Gomel electrometer plant, Gomel, Belarus) , Gomel, Belarus).
 The lack of Ti-Si glass electrode sensitivity to molecular hydrogen, as well as its ability to catalyze oxidative reactions, determines the advantage of these electrodes over the platinum (Pt) electrode [9, 6].
  Due to this feature, the oxidation-restoring state of bacterial suspension can be measured with the help of Ti-Si electrode.
 The Pt electrode is sensitive to oxygen։ hydrogen.
 Consequently, under no circumstances, this electrode registers only the amount of molecular hydrogen (H2).
In fact, the sharp decline in OVP to negative values ​​indicates an increase in the amount of hydrogen in the environment.
The transport of ions through bacterial membranes was studied using an epothenometric method based on changes in their activity in the environment.
  This method is based on the electromotive amplification of a galvanic cell composed of relative cation-selective electrodes.
 The method allows to determine even the smallest changes in the flow of ions, as the surface / volume ratio of bacteria is quite large (10-4 cm -1).
 The cation-selective electrodes used to determine the activity of H + և K + in the environment were prepared at the Institute of Chemistry of the St. Petersburg State University (St. Petersburg, Russia).
  The chloride-silver electrode (Gomel Electrometer Factory, Gomel, Belarus) made of 3 M KCl was used as a comparative electrode.
 The cation-selective electrodes were placed in a thermostatic chamber (37 0C) relative to the general electrode.
The instructions for the electrodes were determined using an ionometer, and the data were recorded using a Labvuw computer program.
Research results և their discussion.
  Study of bacterial growth at 0.2 և 0.8% glucose fermentation և pH values ​​5.5 և 7.5.
  It is known that the redox potential of bacterial growth medium (BPH) as a physicochemical factor is important for the bioactivity of bacteria.
Anaerobic growing environments (both rich in organic matter and low in carbon with a unique carbon source) have positive OVP values.
  Such a value of OVP may be due to the presence of dissolved oxygen or a certain amount of different oxidants.
 The growth of the culture, that is, the multiplication of bacteria in your environment, takes place at a high rate և is conditioned by the decline of OVP (negative from positive values).
  The decline in OVP indicates the intensification of recovery processes.
  That is, bacteria grow under anaerobic conditions at negative OVP values ​​of the environment, when at the same time a decrease in pH from basic to acidic is observed.
Such a result shows the correlation of OVP with the pH of the environment.
 The study of glucose fermentation of E.coli bacterium has been performed many times under different conditions of oxygen-free, acid-base pH.
To perform this experiment, at a temperature of 37 ° C for 17 hours, 3 ml of bacterial suspension (making up 2% of the study medium) was taken from the overnight medium of bacteria grown in 0.2 և 0.8% glucose և transferred to a 150 ml pre-disinfected peptone growth medium.
 Since, as already mentioned, the pH value of the medium is a necessary condition for fermentation, the growth of these samples was observed under conditions of two different pH values.
Bacterial growth was observed within 24 hours in four samples, two of which were wild-type E. coli BW25113 cultures grown at 0.2% և 0.8% glucose, respectively, and the other two were E. coli JRG3621 (hyfB-R). are cultures of the defective mutant strain, also grown at 0.2 և 0.8% glucose concentrations.
 These samples were grown in a thermostat at a temperature of 37 0C.
 Bacterial suspension was removed from the samples every hour, OVP, pH և optical density values ​​were determined.
 Another measurement was performed at the 24th hour.
As can be seen from Figure 4 և 5, during the increments the readings of the two electrodes (Pt և Ti-Si) decrease from positive to negative values. In the conditions of fermentation of col 0.2 և 0.8% glucose concentrations of և 0.2 և 0.8% bacteria of E. coli BW25113 bacteria, the Pt electrode indication reaches և -400 mV from the 3rd hour of growth under the acid and basic values ​​of pH.
 This indicates the production of molecular hydrogen (Figure 2).

It should be noted that high glucose concentrations do not have a stimulating effect on H2 production.
 At the same time, acidification of the environment is observed. An increase in optical density is observed.
 Note that the high glucose levels had a 1.3 և 1.2-fold increase in wild-type E. coli BW25113 bacteria at pH 7.5 և pH 5.5, respectively (Figure 1).
The picture is different in the case of E. coli hyfB-R mutant with HID-4 violation.
As can be seen from Figure 3 (here in all samples observed for OVP decline), the Pt electrode reading in the sliding phase does not reach -400 mV.
This indicates the absence of molecular hydrogen production, although after 24 hours the production of H2 is observed under the conditions of և´ 0.2, 0.8% glucose fermentation,, acidic, և´ basic pH.

Picture 3 ․ E. coli hyfB-R mutant strain glucose on oxygen at the time of pH values ​​of 5.5 և 7.5 at platinum (Pt) electrode with titanium-silicate electrode (Ti-Si).
 The curves of glucose (C) 0.2 և 0.8% samples are presented.
Moreover, if we compare the results of the optical densities (OX) of the wild-type և hyfB-R mutant strain grown under the same conditions, we can see that the growth of the hyfB-R strain is approximately 1.3 times higher than that of the wild-type strain.
 This suggests that Hid-4 may play a role in bacterial growth.
  However, this mutant is found in bacterial asbestos with high glucose fermentation at 0.8%.
Study of ion fluxes in the membrane of E. coli batteries under the fermentation of different amounts of glucose. The study investigated E. coli BW2513 և hyfB-R Hid-4 mutant H + fluxes by potentiometric method (see Methods).
  Bacteria were grown under the fermentation of 0.2 և 0.8% glucose.
  A mass of bacteria was obtained, which was introduced into an experimental medium.
  Then 0.2 or 0.8% glucose was introduced.
  Acidification of the medium (H + emission) and absorption of K + was immediately observed (Figure 4).
  Proton emission kinetics were recorded, ion flux velocities were calculated (Table 2).
Parallel experiments were performed in the presence of FOF1 AEFA inhibitor DCs.
  It was shown that the H + streams were DSCD-sensitive. At a concentration of 0․5 mmHg in the DCH, the H + flux was inhibited 1.6 times (Figure 4, Table 1).
 The result assumes its effect on FoF1 AEFA activity.
 When the bacteria were grown under 0.2% glucose, 2 0.2% glucose was introduced, the proton release rate was 4.5 mmol / min, and the FoF1 AEP phase flow was 1.6 mmol / min.
 The introduction of 0.8% glucose 1.1 increases the rate of proton excretion.
 When the bacteria were grown under 0.8% glucose fermentation, the experimental medium introduced 0.2 և 0.8% glucose with a proton 1.1-fold increase in expiratory velocity compared to the bacteria grown in 0.2% glucose (Table 1).

Picture 4 ․ Kinetics of proton-potassium metabolism in E. coli BW25113 bacteria during fermentation of 0.2% glucose at 7.5 pH.
There is evidence that the presence of glucose in the low buffer medium suppresses the expression of hyf operon genes.
  The work of Andrews և and his colleagues has shown that the activator of the hyf opera has an effect on the genes of the hyf, but not the hyc opera.
  Hid-3 has been shown to be primarily responsible for hydrogen production at low pH values.
 Mnatsakanyan և Others have shown that the addition of formic acid to the pH value of 7.5 activates the hyc operon;
  This adds to the above data, where the glucose concentration was 0.8% (more formic acid may be produced by activating the hyc operon).
As noted, Hid-4 can interact with FoF1 AEF by providing regenerative equivalents for energy transport.
  Indicates that under conditions of limited glucose production, Hid-4 undergoes hydrogen production during fermentation.
Thus, the results indicate the potential of Heid 4 for bacterial growth, suggesting that glucose levels և ambient pH may be significant for Heid-4 Հ FoF1 AEPhase interaction.
