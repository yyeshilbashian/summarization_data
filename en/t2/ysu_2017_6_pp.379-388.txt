MODERN CHALLENGES OF INFORMATION WARS IN ARMENIA In modern conditions, the issues of information security, information wars, and information environment occupy a significant place in comparative political science20.
Information warfare is the struggle of states, non-governmental organizations, through the means of information technologies, turning them into information weapons and spreading various ideas.
  The long-term impact on public opinion և mass consciousness is conditioned by the peculiarities of information wars.
  In the modern era, information wars are inhumane. Human policy is a serious threat.
 It is especially dangerous when they support cyber warfare, dissemination and confrontation at the state level by developing various communication processes.
 The subjects of the information policy of the Republic of Armenia strive to strengthen the information environment.
  The values ​​of independence, democracy, peace, international cooperation and preservation of the Armenian identity are essential for the establishment of the information society.
 The peaceful settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict within the framework of the OSCE Minsk Group, the issues of recognition and condemnation of the Armenian Genocide, the development of Armenia-Diaspora relations, being pan-Armenian priority issues, are directly subjected to anti-humanitarian actions of information and psychological wars.
  Aggressive information campaign against the Armenian society 20 For more details see Панарин И. N., Information War and Geopolitics, M., 2006. pp., SPb., 2008, Rid T. and Hecker M., War 2.0.

 Regularly taking advantage of the tension in international relations, Turkey and Azerbaijan propagate anti-Armenian hatred, trying to change the reality.
 Moreover, by constantly improving the information warfare technologies directed against the Armenian communities of Armenia.
  The international community, based on the desire to live safely, has developed appropriate procedures to prevent the devastating dangers posed by information flows.
  Armenia, as a subject of information security, actively conducts bilateral-multilateral negotiations, assuming a number of responsibilities within the framework of the UN, EU, CoE, OSCE, EEU.
The Sumgait tragedy, which is considered a continuation of the Armenian Genocide, was followed by the unification of Armenia and Artsakh.
 And today, cases of ceasefire violations are often registered on the Armenian-Azerbaijani border, according to which different data are presented, become the subject of analysis and studies.
 Unprecedented military operations have been registered in recent days, and in order to change the national worldview in the public sphere, it is necessary to implement relevant information programs.
  2014 A tragic event took place on the Armenian-Azerbaijani line of contact on November 12, 2010. The Russian "Igla" anti-aircraft missile was hit by the Mi-24 attack helicopter of the Armenian Defense Army 22, which participated in the RA-NKR military exercise. .
  According to the statement of the Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense, the Armenian helicopter attacked the Azerbaijani positions, as a result of which the latter opened fire and destroyed it24.
 However, the spokesman of the RA Ministry of Defense A. Hovhannisyan wrote on his Facebook page. "The fabrications of the Azerbaijani side that the Armenian helicopters attacked their positions are meaningless, they responded.
 The study of the helicopter wreckage will allow to confirm that the helicopter was not armed.
 This aggravation of the situation by the Azerbaijani system continues, Yerevan, "Noravank" Foundation, 2009, Harutyunyan G., Information Security Issues of the Organization of the Armenians // "21st CENTURY", No. 2 (20), 2008, pp. 1-18, RA Information System Development issues in the context of national security, Yerevan, Noravank Foundation, 2002, etc.

It was when the helicopter had already landed… ”25.
 The air strikes in the region seem to have become symbolic of new geopolitical developments.
  One year after the Armenian helicopter was shot down, Turkey shot down a Russian Su-24 plane on the Turkish-Syrian border26.
The event caused various comments.
 The Russian "Kommersant" periodical wrote to the Turkish Prime Minister A. Davutoglu commented on "what can be done to return the occupied territories of Azerbaijan" as a response to Russia's economic and political sanctions, "a step to enter from the Karabakh front."
  The Republic of Turkey is officially considered a possible external threat to the Republic of Armenia28, which puts the issue of recognizing the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan among the preconditions for the establishment of Armenian-Turkish relations29.
  Turkey's aspiration for reconciliation with Russia is directly absent at the level of statements, and the continuous conflict of Russian-Turkish interests in the conditions of the fragile Armenian-Azerbaijani ceasefire may push the Azerbaijani side to take more adventurous steps.
 And whether political scientist A. Iskandaryan believes that Azerbaijan has potential problems with Nagorno-Karabakh30, but our combat readiness, including vigilance and targeted intelligence activities, should play a primary role in the political interests of all actors.
  At the regional level, the main threats to the information activities of Armenia և Artsakh ական Artsakh's information security are the main goals of the Azerbaijani direction 31: 1) Armenia ացումը care, cultural and material values ​​related to the Armenians, "destruction" as opposed to the rise of Azerbaijan; In contrast to the common enemy (Armenians) 25 Hovhannisyan A.

According to Doctor of Political Science, Professor V. According to Makarov, information wars have 3 main signs32, which are fully operational during the Armenian-Azerbaijani information warfare. 1) the purposeful activity of harming the state interests of the enemy, 2) the secret information-psychological operations as an organized form of activity, 3) the use of information weapons.
An information weapon is a set of means և methods that allow information to be stolen, distorted or destroyed, restricted or restricted from accessing legitimate users of information, disrupting or shutting down computer systems used to ensure statehood 33 statehood 33.
  The authors consider information weapons 34 as computer viruses, software logic "bombs", means of suppressing information exchange in the telecommunication network, falsification of information through state-military information channels, means of neutralizing test programs, targeting various errors in the software of the facility.
  Since 1998, widely used Armenian websites have been the target of attacks, as evidenced by intrusions into Armenian cyberspace, hence anti-Armenian actions.
 Information weapons are available from any military weapon, but can inflict no less painful blows, especially in the case of Azerbaijani use, it becomes pronounced criminally.

  Massacres of Armenians The deportation started on January 13 (Harutyunyan G., Kotanjyan H. և Others, Anti-Armenian Information System of Azerbaijan, Noravank Foundation, Yerevan 2009, 114 pages, pages 38, 54).
The websites of the RA embassies were subjected to genocidal attacks36, which, according to information security expert S. Martirosyan, 2009 It was the first serious attack on the part of the RA state network since September 37.
 The response blow was not late. The Armenians broke the big Azerbaijani blog platform, վեցին 16 thousand user data were published38.
  Already on January 28, Monte Melkonyan's cyber army hackers launched a new attack on Azerbaijani state websites and Azerbaijani e-mail addresses39.
  Another example is the computer virus that spread on Facebook during the hostilities in early April.
 Due to information security specialists, the spread of the program to change the screen image by the user with the RA flag was prevented 40 41.
Since April 2, there has been no shortage of rumors, "reliable sources" on the current Armenian-Russian-Turkish-Azerbaijani relations, arms sales, territorial concessions, discussions on Russian peacekeepers, but the main manifestation of the political direction of information backlash is at the level of official statements.
  Both the Armenian authorities and the OSCE Minsk Group Presidents, CIS Foreign Ministers, OSCE Ambassadors and EU Ambassadors, the UN Under-Secretary-General's criticism of the military solution at other diplomatic levels were criticized, and a PACE Declaration on the peaceful settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict was adopted42.
 However, once again the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry issued an indictment43, which stated that Armenia "gross violation of international law, maintaining the status quo in the occupied territories, military presence in the occupied territories, demographics of lands" 36 See "Armenian embassy websites hacked" (20.01 .16), http.

"to change the physical, physical nature, to prevent hundreds of thousands of Azeris from returning to their homes."
 In response, the Armenian Foreign Ministry stated 44 that this cynical statement distorts the reality, turns the obvious facts upside down, seeks to disrupt the negotiations under the auspices of the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs, that clear steps are needed to bring order to Azerbaijan and bring a clear constructive field.
 Although from time to time statements are made about the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, but it is obvious that they are not enough to ensure the peaceful coexistence of the two peoples.
After the April war, we can assure you that in this new phase of hostilities, subjected to various information attacks, we redirected our national priorities, moving away from the previous way of life, we entered a new phase of creating a future based on our own strength.
 In general, we can say that Armenia, as a full-fledged party to the information war, has a number of features.
1. The use of information and communication technologies is widely available in the Republic of Armenia.
 2000 The information technology industry was recognized by the Government of the Republic of Armenia as one of the dominant branches of the Armenian economy45, which started the success of Armenian IT specialists in this field.
 2015 According to the NSS, 69% of the population of Armenia used the Internet, 46 in 2016. 70% of the population of Armenia actively uses the Internet, in the case of Georgia it makes 60%, and in the case of Azerbaijan - 61% 47.
  Such a picture offers ample opportunities both to meet modern challenges and to receive vulnerable attacks.
 2016 The April war proved that the Armenian society, as the main source of information on military events, preferred the official news. At the beginning of April, the ranking list of the number of followers in the Armenian domain of Facebook was headed by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Defense A. Hovhannisyan48, who mainly uses 44 See the statement of the RA Ministry of Foreign Affairs (21.04.16).

There was a text format for transmitting information in social mobile usage.
 This method allows the public to think critically, simply seeming more reliable than visual or auditory information.
  The required amount of visual information was provided later.
  To fill the information vacuum in crisis situations, the public turns to various information sources.
 According to the results of the survey conducted on April 2-6 this year (according to Alexa.com), the main audience of the leading Azerbaijani electronic media milli.az, trend.az, haqqin.az are Azerbaijanis (90% և more).
The latter use the Armenian press to quench their information thirst. That is, on April 2-6, 21.74% of the average news.am audience made visits from Azerbaijan.
 Unlike Azeris, Armenians are particularly interested in visiting non-Azerbaijani websites, which is due to both the necessary amount of internal information and the lack of foreign language articles on Azerbaijani websites.
  According to the above-mentioned study, Armenians use the information provided by haqqin.az website the most, which does not exceed 5% of the audience.
At the same time, the Azerbaijani propaganda work with the external audience should not be underestimated, for example, since 2009 the multilingual English, Russian, Persian, Turkish and Armenian international TV channel "ATV International" 49 has been operating.
  It is broadcast via satellite in neighboring countries, with Armenian broadcasts seen as an opportunity to "convey the truth about Azerbaijan to the Armenian audience" and "address the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh directly."
  In such conditions, in working with an external audience, we consider it necessary to use the fact that information is available to strangers, which in this case is quite restrained.
  Still in 1943 German radio stations broadcast in 53 languages51.
2. Another goal of the information war is the violation of the control of the enemy's information system, as a rule.
  In the direction of the Armenian information positions by Azerbaijan 49 See Azerbaijan TV channel ATV INTERNATIONAL changed the parameters to HOT BIRD13 ° E (15.10.11).

2016 The April attack was definitely a failure.
  According to military expert K. Vrtanesyan52: One of the main goals of this attack was to cause panic among Armenians.
  However, the Armenian, who stood out with incomparable restraint, preferred to get the main information, especially in the first hours of the war, from sources that provide objective information.
  The list of unreliable websites was spread by a number of active users on the Internet, providing a range of information necessary for information security, but in the days following the war, the "nation that became an army" was also provided with old videos and pictures that were far from reflecting false information.
  In order to overcome the uncertain flood of information, we propose to clearly state by legislative initiative the informational, analytical, entertaining or other types of mass media, which will define the corresponding responsibilities for deviating from the given dimension.
 This will allow the public to report information in separate directions.
3. Especially during the "peaceful" war period, the assessment of tactical dangers և attacks becomes more difficult.
 2016 In April, the Azerbaijani side often spread misinformation, presenting the well-known hostess as a sniper53, preparing a report in front of a local sign 54 (before that, a H1 TV reporter 55 reported on the situation in Artsakh next to the real sign), fake pictures 56, publication of a fake document, etc.
 Undoubtedly, this is a version of the internal audience propaganda, which is closed to any external interference.
4. Any attempt by the parties to the conflict to come together at the conciliation table shall be subject to information influence by this or that party to the conflict.
 As a result, in parallel with the unbalanced course of the NKR-Azerbaijan conflict, the first man is subjected to information attacks 52 See Military expert. The goal of the Ministry of Defense of Azerbaijan is to cause panic (03.04.16).

The Minsk Group, which is considered an interested party in the NKR settlement.
 The ambiguity of the "friend-enemy" distinction typical of information warfare allows to expect the spread of anti-Armenian information even in the case of strategic allies.
 A vivid example of that is the Russian Deputy Prime Minister D. Rogozin's statement to provide Armenia և Azerbaijan with military armament58.
5. The perception of the nation-state as a high public value is the way to save many unpleasant events.
 Especially for the Armenians all over the world, the existence of uncertain national-state borders in case of taking planned information actions has served as an additional precondition for being "Armenian" and disseminating information.
