ARMENIAN-GERMAN ECONOMIC COOPERATION 1991-2008 In the current period of world economic development, the establishment of stable international economic relations is of key importance for each country.
  The analysis of the level of inter-economic cooperation between the Republic of Armenia and the Federal Republic of Germany should be based on the analysis of international trade, labor flows, capital exports, international credit, international monetary relations, international scientific-technical-production cooperation.
The economy of the Federal Republic of Germany is a post-industrial economy based on the principle of a social market economy, of which industry is one of the leading industries.
 Germany is the leader in Europe in terms of economic strength, ranking third in the G7 after the United States after Japan.
  At the end of the 20th century, Germany, as the most influential country in Europe, gained a special status as the economic driver of the region, the emerging leader of the European Union1.
Traditionally, industry has been one of the leading sectors of the German economy, which is the main engine of foreign trade.
  German information և biotechnologies, ecologically clean technologies related to the use of alternative energy sources occupy high positions in the world.
 The main exported products are machinery, vehicles, chemical products, metals and textiles.
The Armenian economy is still on the way to building a market economy, but it is one of the few CIS countries that succeeded in 2000-2008. to double the gross domestic product in the conditions of economic blockade and transport restrictions.
  As a result, a unique model of economic development was formed, which ensured rather high rates of economic development - macroeconomic stability, until 2008. The impact of the global financial crisis.

Thus, the economies of the Republic of Germany and Germany, which are in different stages of economic development, are incomparable in terms of economic capacity, but from the very beginning of Armenia's independence, Germany has shown a willingness to assist Armenia in building a market economy.
1990 After the reunification, Germany, in parallel with its political goals, sought to strengthen its economic influence in the newly independent Transcaucasian republics that were part of the former Soviet Union.
At the same time, after the collapse of the USSR, Armenia relied on the support of Western countries, including Germany.
  However, Armenia, which is not rich in natural resources and is under blockade of communication, was not considered by Germany as a potentially profitable partner during the first years of independence.
 On the other hand, there was always the Russian factor.
 As K. mentions. Haji, "the economic penetration of any power in the Caucasus is itself seen as a narrowing of Russian interests in this region."
1990s The main aspect of the economic cooperation between the FRG and the Republic of Armenia in the first half of the 20th century was the financial and technical assistance to eliminate the consequences of the armed conflict, the establishment of a competitive market economy, an effective system of public administration, and the fight against poverty and its social consequences2.
The emphasis on German social assistance programs was not accidental, as the German model of economic development in the period was characterized as a social market economy, which was a compromise between economic growth and the most equitable distribution of wealth.
The basis of the technical assistance programs provided to Germany by Armenia was laid in 1993, and the financial assistance programs have been implemented since May 5, 1995, when the first agreement on financial cooperation between the Government of the Republic of Armenia and the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany was signed.
  Within the framework of technical cooperation, the projects are implemented by the German Technical Cooperation Company (GTZ, now GIZ) by 4 parties.
 Financial cooperation programs are funded by the KfW Development Bank with funding from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).
  Among the implemented programs, it is worth mentioning "Refugee Assistance", "Energy Immediate Assistance", "Transmission System Rehabilitation", "Rehabilitation of Communal Infrastructure in Armavir Marz" and other programs6.
We can say that in the 1990s. Armenian-German economic relations, despite the existence of a number of interstate agreements, were mainly limited to Germa 1 See Gadzhiev K., Geopolitics of the Caucasus, Moscow, 2003, p. 295.2 See Die GTZ in Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia // GTZ, available at www.gtz.de/de/weltweit/574.htm, available at: 3 See Pogorletsky A., закономика зарубежных страни, Second edition , St. Petersburg, 2001, p. 211.4 The GFC is a federal institution of international cooperation operating in different countries of the world, which aims to contribute to the political, economic development of the South-Eastern countries, the solution of environmental and social problems by improving the living conditions of the people.

With the technical and financial assistance provided by Armenia to Armenia, the trade turnover between the two countries was still low.
1998 As of November 1, 2012, out of the total number of 1299 foreign-invested enterprises registered in the RA State Register, only 24 were with German participation, 16 of which were Armenian-German joint ventures. In most of them, the German share did not reach 1%.
 In terms of the level of activity of joint ventures with Germany, the presence of German companies in Armenia, Armenia was several times behind Georgia and Azerbaijan 1.
This was due to some reservations of German investors in connection with capital investments in Armenia, which, unfortunately, were due to the internal political situation in Armenia, the insufficient level of investment image and investment protection guarantees.
Tendencies to intensify economic relations between the two countries began in 2000.
 In particular, in 2000 The visit of the delegation of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Bundestag in May, the visit of the delegation led by the President of the Bundestag A. Fuchs, the visit of the delegation of the Bundestag նտես Development Committee հ in July և December գործում the visit of the delegation headed by Hans Georg Wagner հարցերի
It is necessary to separate 2000. The business forum dedicated to the Armenian economy, which was successfully held in Berlin on May 11, 2012, can be considered the first large-scale event to simplify Armenia's economic and investment environment and attract German investments.
 It is noteworthy that in 2000 The "EXPO 2000" international exhibition was held in Hanover, Germany from June 1 to October 31, 2012. Armenia was presented with a separate pavilion.
 2001 May 9-11, 2001 in Bonn. Regular intergovernmental talks on issues of Armenian-German cooperation in the field of development.
  As a result of negotiations, it was decided that in 2001-2002. To provide a total of 49 million German marks in financial and technical assistance to Armenia for cooperation, of which 5 million as grants and the rest as soft loans under the terms of the International Development Association3.
Studying the dynamics of trade turnover between the two countries in 1998-2008, we record the following picture (see Table 1).
Table 1. Trade turnover indicators between the Republic of Armenia and the Federal Republic of Armenia 4 Exports of the Republic of Armenia Place of the Federal Republic of Germany in the export of the Republic of Armenia (thousand US dollars) Import of the Republic of Armenia from the Federal Republic of Germany since 2004 A rather high growth was registered, from 6.5% to 11.5%.

4 The table was compiled by the author on the basis of data on foreign economic activity published in the annual statistical yearbooks of the National Statistical Service of Armenia. Data for 1998-2000, according to the "Statistical Yearbook of Armenia 2001" (pp. 451-458), 2001-2004. Data according to the "Statistical Yearbook of Armenia" 2005 (pp. 487-493), 2005-2008. data according to the "Statistical Yearbook of Armenia" 2009 (pp. 457-463).
Considering the dynamics of the specific weight of Germany in the import of Armenia, a relative increase in the demand for German products in the Armenian market has been registered since 2004, and already in 2005. The index was 7.8% for the highest period.
  2002 The continuous growth of the share of exports, which is more noticeable since 2004, was conditioned by a number of objective factors, including the 2003 decision of the President of the Republic of Armenia Robert Kocharyan. A number of agreements reached in the field of economic cooperation within the framework of a working visit to the Federal Republic of Germany on January 14-15, 2010 (on intensive cooperation in the field of private business, implementation of the Armenian-German large business forum, etc.).
R. was of great importance in the further expansion of the Armenian-German economic ties. Kocharyan in 2004 The second official visit to Germany on November 17-19, during which the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany G. Schroeder noted with satisfaction that the trade turnover between Germany and Armenia increased by 40% 1.
The study of the dynamics of German investments in the Armenian economy (see Figure 2.4) shows that along with the activation of the trade turnover between the Republic of Armenia and the Federal Republic of Germany since 2004, a significant inflow of German capital into the Armenian economy has been observed.
Line 2. German investments in the RA economy (1998-2008) 2. In general, 1998-2006. The FRG invested $ 186,672.8 thousand in Armenia, which is 7.65% of the total investments made during the given period, and 10.91% of the direct investments3.
  Note that in 2005 The decrease in investments compared to 2006 does not indicate a decline in the level of trade and economic relations between the two countries. just in 2005 The large index of German investments in the Armenian economy was conditioned by the launch of a large investment project in the mining sector.
  It should be noted that in 2006 և 2007 respectively 47815.9 thousand implemented with German capital. և 55251.9 thousand The investments of 4 dollars were directed only to the mining industry, which clearly indicates the need to diversify German investments.
2008 It was a turning point not only for the Federal Republic of Germany, but also for the world economy, due to the unprecedented global financial and economic crisis.
  In 2008, the annual growth of the gross domestic product of the German economy was 2%, but this indicator showed a downward trend since 2008. From the third quarter, and already in 2009 there was an economic decline of about 2.25%, which is explained primarily by a significant reduction in German exports.
 The global financial and economic crisis led to a decline in demand for German companies' products, which was reflected in almost all sectors of exports.
  In particular, the number of cars was greatly reduced.
  The investments made in the economic sector are taken into account.
 Investments in the financial sector are not included in this case.

The demand for industrial products, which are known to be the main branches of the German economy1.
This partly explains the 2008 Significant reduction of German investments in the Armenian economy.
 According to Figure 2, in 2008 German investments in Armenia have decreased by more than 57% compared to the previous year.
  The reason was the decrease in the demand for raw materials in the world market, and the main branch of German investments in the real sector of the Armenian economy is the mining industry.
In the context of strengthening the Armenian-German economic ties, cooperation in the financial sector, in particular in the banking sector, is significantly strengthened.
  According to the report submitted by the NSS on the basis of the data received from the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia, in 2008 703786.2 thousand dollars were invested in the share capital of Armenian banks and credit organizations by non-residents, of which German investments made 45205.2 thousand dollars, or only 6.42% of the investments2, which was the largest investment made by Germany in the banking capital of Armenia.
In terms of financial cooperation, the "Renewable Energy Support" and "Sustainable Housing Financing Market Development" programs implemented since 2006 by the German-Armenian Project Management Office 3 (ACA) are essentially important.
2008 The agreement on financial cooperation for 2007-2008 was signed between the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Government of the Republic of Armenia during 2007. It was envisaged to provide about 74 million Euros in financial assistance to Armenia (70 million Euros as a loan, 4 million Euros as a grant).
2008 Armenia's exports to Germany amounted to 183.7 million dollars, and imports from Germany - 255.6 million dollars (see Table 2.1), which amounted to 102.8 million - 134.3 million euros, total trade - 237.1 million euros, while the trade turnover for the same year in the case of Georgia - Azerbaijan According to the German Foreign Ministry, they amounted to 358 million և 2.400 million euros4.
Thus, the Armenian-German economic cooperation did not show a high level of intensity in the initial period of Armenia's independence, until the early 2000s it was manifested mainly in the form of financial and technical assistance provided by Germany to Armenia, which, although a great support to the Armenian economy. in the implementation process, but was not sufficient for effective trade and partnership.
The development of bilateral economic relations was given a great impetus especially by the support programs of the small "medium-sized" banking sector implemented within the framework of the "Caucasus Initiative", as well as the activation of the frequency of interstate visits, which began in 2003. RA President R. Kocharyan paid an official visit to Germany, which was the first official visit of the RA President to Germany.
The year 2004 was a turning point in the framework of economic cooperation between the Republic of Germany and the Federal Republic of Germany, during which a large Armenian-German business forum took place, followed by a significant inflow of German capital into the Armenian economy, in particular at the Zangezur Copper and Molybdenum Combine Company. at the expense of investment.
 At the same time, there was an increase in trade, both in the export and import sectors.

 The only founder of the institution is the Central Bank of Armenia.
 The main purpose of the ACS is to implement and manage the loan programs of the German-Armenian Fund within the framework of the Interstate Agreements between the Governments of the Republic of Germany and the Governments of the Federal Republic of Germany.

2008 As of today, there were more than 100 companies with German capital operating in Armenia, including representatives of a number of world-renowned companies, and the volume of trade had significantly increased.
Nevertheless, in the field of economic cooperation with the Federal Republic of Germany in the region, due to a number of objective factors, Armenia still continued to yield to neighboring Georgia and Azerbaijan.
