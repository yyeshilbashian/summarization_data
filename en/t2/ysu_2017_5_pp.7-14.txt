SOCIO-ECONOMIC-GEOGRAPHICAL THEMATIC CARTOGRAPHY IN ARMENIA Modern socio-economic cartography is a large independent scientific field, which has its own theoretical-methodological bases, an important field of practical activity. It expresses the social and economic elements of geosystems.
Socio-economic cartography և Its constituent socio-economic-geographical cartography clearly reflects the urgency of a comprehensive study of economic and social phenomena in the spatial, geographical sector.
  That is why this branch of science uses special types of cartographic research, which are based on comprehensive, systematically analyzed, synthesized information on the population, economy, and social sphere in space-time.
 In this respect, socio-economic cartography enriches economic, social, political geography, provides their information-methodological connection with physical geography, geo-ecology, regional geography, other geographical sciences.
A variety of socio-economic thematic maps can be seen in the atlases, where they are of great practical importance and are used in solving the problems of territorial organization and management of individual sectors of the economy.
 Without such maps, the atlas would lose its completeness, its scientific value.
Socio-economic maps are required to maintain their "geographical nature", firstly it must correspond to the real distribution of the given phenomenon, and secondly, it must have detail, ie it must express all the constituent elements of the phenomenon, both individually and interconnectedly. in.
In the atlases, this section follows the section on nature, as the structure and location of many socio-economic-geographical phenomena are conditioned by natural features.
 Socio-economic maps are characterized by movement և temporality.
  Unlike nature maps, they are "obsolete", so the content of maps should be based on complex synthetic characteristics.
There are several types of socio-economic maps: maps that express elements of a local nature, have a specific place, create specific systems, such as maps of settlements, industrial centers, transport routes, - maps that express individual elements of socio-economic phenomena. Characteristics, such as maps expressing specialization, production volumes of the economy - maps that express the spatial processes of socio-economic phenomena, elements, such as maps of population movements, crop yields, - synthetic or combination maps, which present socio-economic world systems as a whole,for example, a map of settlements according to their function or function, or a map of the location of industrial centers according to their degree of specialization.
The process of compiling socio-economic maps is more complicated due to the use of a larger number of sources than the nature maps.
 As a rule, their legends are more complicated combined, there are many diagrams, tables, texts presented in the form of inscriptions.
  Most of the cartographic methods are used here.
Atlases of socio-economic-geographical section maps are divided into two major groups: maps belonging to the social sphere քարտեզ maps belonging to the economic sphere [2].
 The first group includes other maps of the population, the service sector, social and political life.
 Economic maps are divided into maps of individual branches of the general economic economy.
To get acquainted with the content of the socio-economic thematic maps and the cartographic methods of their compilation in more detail, let us analyze 1984 ․ Published the Atlas of Agriculture of the Armenian SSR.
 It is a cartographic work of scientific-informational nature, which details the factors influencing the development and structure of agriculture, presents the interconnection of natural and socio-economic preconditions of agricultural development.
  It is a thematic atlas intended for agricultural research and organizational structures, a unique work in its field.
 The project of compiling the atlas was developed at the Chair of Economic Geography of the Armenian State Pedagogical University after Kh. Abovyan.
 Scientific and organizational work was done. science Dr. L. Under the direct leadership of Valesyan.
  The chairmen of the Editorial Board are: Candidate of Technical Sciences, Minister of Agriculture of the Armenian SSR G. V. Tarjumyan.
  Among the members of the editorial board are engineers-cartographers G. A. Bogatova, A. V. Kravchenko, A. F. Chepkasov, Head of the Chair of the Research Institute of Economics and Agriculture, A. O. Hambardzumyan և others.
  Economists, agriculturists, biologists and other specialists also took part in those works.
The atlas consists of six sections, which include more than three hundred maps.
 The sections are.1. "Geographical location of the Armenian SSR և general description" ․ It includes 12 maps.
 The section begins with a description of the physical-geographical position of the Armenian SSR1.
A map with a scale of 2,000,000, which reflects the geographical, physical and geographical location of the country, gives an idea of ​​the relief of the area.
The analysis of the cartographic methods used in this section showed that the method of signs in the 12 maps in the section was used in 7 maps, the method of quantitative background in 6 maps, the methods of scales and lines were used in 7 maps, the methods of cartograms and cartograms were used in mapping, 2 the method of areas in the map.
 Other cartographic methods have not found expression in these sections.
  Responsible for this section Dr. L. It is Valesyan.
2. The section "Assessment of natural conditions and resources for agricultural development" includes 119 maps.
 All elements of the natural environment are evaluated: surface, climate, water, soil, vegetation, fauna.
  There are 5 maps depicting the morphology of the relief, the horizontal, vertical fragmentation.
  Glare վում The radiation balance is expressed by means of a single map.
  Air temperature changes և The maps showing the different features are 12.
 Another 12 maps show atmospheric precipitation, their distribution, atmospheric humidity, evaporation, presence of stable snow cover և Other features, presence of atmospheric precipitation during the vegetation period of different plants.
 6 maps show the manifestations of droughts and frostbite.
  4 maps show the period corresponding to cattle breeding.
  15 maps show the periods of vegetation, flowering, grain and potato sowing of different tree species.
 There are 4 maps characterizing the direction of atmospheric humidity, temperature, winds in different months, and one map shows the meteorological stations.
 The logical continuation of this group of maps is considered to be 1.
The map of the climatic zone with a scale of 1,000,000.
  Map 14 contains detailed information on the river network, the degree of mineralization of river waters, pollution, maximum and minimum flow hazardous areas, and the logical conclusion of this group of maps is the map of the hydrological zoning of the area.
  Map 1 shows the hydrological characteristics of Lake Sanaa.
  Soil types, subtypes, soil solubility, mechanical composition, amount of different chemicals in soils, change in the amount of these substances և other features are summarized in 26 map, agro-industrial grouping of lands և soil zoning is shown.
 5 maps express the vegetation, plant species.
  3 maps are provided for the expression of information about species.
 Map 1 shows the minerals used in agriculture.
 Eventually, a detailed study of all these factors affecting agriculture would lead to the mapping of landscape zones, the physical-geographical zoning, which ends the largest chapter of the atlas.
The analysis of the methods showed that the sign method was used in 18 maps, the qualitative phonimeth method was used in 42 maps, 72 maps were compiled using the quantitative background method, only the 3-scale method was used in 42 maps, and the map method was used in 9 maps. In 5, the method of jagging maps, the method of local diagrams was expressed in only 3 maps, 1 stone thesis was formed using the method of lines of motion.
 Of course, we should not forget that maps provide a lot of information due to the combination of several cartographic methods, which not only increases the scientific value of the material, but also provides more detailed information about the mapping phenomenon.
 Tables and diagrams are presented as auxiliary material, օր the nature diary for different settlements of Armenia is presented as a novelty.
  This department is responsible for labor science. candidate R. Ս. Mkrtchyan.
3. "Socio-economic conditions of agricultural development" ․ It consists of 28 maps, which represent the objects of territorial organization and management of agriculture, the Soviet collective farms, the level of employment of the rural population in them.
  These include the service sector of the rural population (the number of students in rural-urban secondary schools, the level of education of the rural population, the availability of agricultural educational institutions), health-related maps, the location of libraries, clubs and trade maps.
From the analysis of the applied cartographic methods it became clear that the method of signs was used in 11 maps, the method of line-scales was expressed in 12 maps, the method of qualitative background in 2, 5 maps were made 19 using the methods of cartograms.
 It becomes clear that the difference between the maximum number of methods is not so great.
 Responsible for the cartographic work of this chapter of the Atlas. Science and Technology Ս. Մ. Dulyan.
4. 78 maps are summarized in the section "Level of scientific, technical and economic investments in agriculture".
 They are all analytical and evaluation maps, for example, agricultural land evaluation map, land fertility map, economic evaluation of lands, economic evaluation of agricultural lands, etc.
 Separate maps show gardens, grasslands, pastures and vineyards.
  Information is provided on the energy capacity of agriculture through technical means of energy supply, the degree of mechanization of the main types of work on farms is analyzed, etc.
 Among the cartographic methods used in the maps, the methods of cartograms - 45, cartographic diagrams - 31, 6, signs - 15, scales - 14 stand out the most.
 Linear point methods are relatively rarely used.
 Maps made by means of signs and scale methods have an average number.
  The section is equipped with auxiliary materials, various digital materials.
  At the end, the maps of surface water և air basin pollution are given.
  They were responsible for compiling this section of the atlas. science to R.P. Zohrabyan տ Economy science to Գ. Գ. Tsaturyan.
5. There are 62 maps in the "Sectoral structure of agriculture" section.
  The structure, location and level of development of agricultural branches and sub-branches are presented in detail.
  The following methods were most widely used in cartographic methods, in maps - 53, cartograms - 28, scales - 10, point - 7.
  They were responsible for compiling this section of the atlas. science to R. P. Zohrabyan և Economy Science and Technology Գ. Գ. Tsaturyan.
6. There are 22 maps in the section "Territorial organization and spatial structure of agriculture".
  In addition to the maps characterizing each agricultural region, maps of inter-regional relations, land users, and the structure of land plots are also provided.
  The most used of the used cartographic methods are 15 methods of qualitative background, 7 of signs, 12 of scales, 4 methods of lines and 4 map diagrams.
  The people in charge of the last section of the atlas are: work. science Dr. L. H. Valesyan, agriculturist. science Dr.P. R. Arzumanyan և Economy science to O. K. Pervishin.
The atlas ends with the presentation of huge textual information materials related to each section, which once again confirms the scientific direction of the atlas.

From Table 1 it is clear that the maps in the atlas were compiled by several methods at the same time, without compromising their readability and expressiveness.
  The use of cartograms and charts is the largest, which is explained by the peculiarities of the expression of agricultural indicators.
At present, there is a need to create such an atlas, as not only the administrative structure of the country has changed, but in parallel with the privatization process, agriculture has undergone changes in both sectoral and territorial organization.
  Many atlas maps have already lost their relevance, but there are no narrow professional maps corresponding to the current situation.
The most recent scientific information maps on agriculture in 2007 ․ They are published in the National Atlas of Armenia, but here they do not present the content of the atlas of agriculture of the Armenian SSR, therefore the creation of a new agricultural atlas is very important for our country, as it is the leading branch of the economy.
