EGYPT-TURKISH RELATIONS AFTER THE REVOLUTION OF EGYPT IN 2011 AFTER Egypt և Turkey are linked by religious and historical ties, but their diplomatic relations have sometimes been very friendly, sometimes extremely tense and contradictory.
Turkey established diplomatic relations with Egypt in 1925 at the level of Chargé d'Affaires, and since 1948 the two countries have embassies in their capitals.
 They are full members of the Euro-Mediterranean Union and signed a free trade agreement in 20051.
 2008 Political and economic dialogue continued between the two countries2, as a result of which a memorandum on further development of military cooperation was signed3.
In Egypt in 2011 Turkey was the first country after the revolution in February to express its support for the "free will of the Egyptian people."
 Explaining his intention to "give a sincere warning" to President Hosni Mubarak, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called on him to take the necessary measures for peace, security and stability in Egypt.
 The open stance taken by Erdogan և official Turkey differed from the cautious comments made by Western countries4.
After the victory of the Egyptian revolution, Turkish President Abdullah Gul was the first president to resign in 2011. He visited Egypt on March 3.
 The main purpose of Gul's visit was to express solidarity with the Egyptian people.
 He met with representatives of the interim government, discussing the transition period, presenting Turkey's views on Egypt's transition to democracy.
  In his remarks, Gul stressed the importance of a peaceful way of transferring power through free and fair elections5.
The opinion of the Turkish president was very important for the Egyptians during this period, which was due to the fact that Gul has a Muslim-majority population [http: // www.

  It was also said that Turkey had an experience of transition from military to civilian leadership, which allowed to take seriously the advice voiced by the Turkish leaders - the political direction.
The Turkish President was followed by Prime Minister Erdogan, paying a three-day official visit in 2011. on September 12.
  His visit accompanied by 6 ministers, about 200 businessmen, was considered a diplomatic success and met with great enthusiasm from the Egyptians.
  In the "CNN" report, some Egyptians said: "We consider him an Islamic leader in the Middle East."
  This visit caught the world's attention. During the Arab Spring, Erdo ։an enjoyed great prestige in the region.
 There were many reasons for Erdoողan to pay so much attention to the Egyptian and Tunisian Libyan peoples.
 Recently, official Turkey has shown a tough stance towards Israel, which could be interpreted as a pro-Arab stance among the Arabs.
 In addition, Turkey pursued two policies of "soft power", which fully allows us to understand this line of foreign policy.
During the mentioned period, there was a real shortage of "leaders" in the countries that lived in the Arabian Peninsula.
  During revolutions, people usually look for reputable individuals whom they can trust, who can lead them.
  This is a very important factor in organizing revolutions, when the leader is not only charismatic, but also pays attention to ordinary people on the street, thus winning the hearts of ordinary citizens.
  In fact, Erdo ։an made a similar move during his official visit, encouraging Egyptians to adapt their country to the demands of a democratic state, in exchange for which Turkey would be willing to invest in Egypt.
  During his visit, which, by the way, was called "historic" by the Turkish press3, Erdogan agreed to increase Turkey's investments in Egypt to $ 5 billion, increasing the volume of trade between them4.
One week after Erdoողan's departure from Egypt, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoօlu expressed his vision for the future of relations between Egypt and Turkey.
 He noted that these are the strongest, most populous, influential countries in the region, and their strong alliance can create a new axis of power, the "axis of democracy", while the US influence in the Middle East seems to be diminishing5.
[http:
//edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/09/12/turkey.diplomacy/].2 "Soft power" is a form of political power that allows to achieve the desired result through voluntary participation, sympathy and attractiveness, as opposed to a "tough force" that implies direct coercion.
 The concept was first used by Joseph Nye.
3 The Egyptian revolution in Turkey and the subsequent processes were generally covered very positively. The above-mentioned visit was called historic, the elections held were free, fair, without any clashes, etc.
[http:
//www.todayszaman.com/news-269483-a-year-after-the-egyptian-revolution-egyptian----turkish-relations-are5 Shadid A., "Turkey Predicts Alliance With Egypt as Regional Anchors", 18.09 .2011, [http:
//www.nytimes.com/ However, the speeches of Turkish officials in Egypt were not accepted unequivocally. Some expressed their concern, noting that the Egyptian revolution is not over yet,, Erdogan is looking for the strategic interests of the country in Egypt.
 There were even opinions that during the transition period in Egypt, Turkey could shift the balance in favor of a force that might "stand between the freedom of the Egyptians and the latter."
Despite the ideological rapprochement, official Cairo-Ankara relations have been developing slowly since the overthrow of Mubarak, and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo ։an's statement during his visit to Egypt has caused political uproar.
  Erdoանըan urged the Egyptians to adopt a secular constitution in the near future, which was negatively accepted by the Islamists, especially the "Muslim Brotherhood", who called Erdo իսan a defender of Islam but advised him not to interfere in the internal affairs of their country2.
Erdoողan mainly met with Islamists, particularly the "Brothers", which seemed alarming to other political groups.
 This is the opinion of the young liberal forces that carried out the revolution.
 At that time, it still seemed to them that Erdogan was the man who could transform the "Muslim Brotherhood" into a moderate force.
As a result of the Arab Spring, the socio-political forces established in the Middle East for many years disintegrated.
  After the initial violent reactions, Turkey's foreign policy lost its practical-pragmatic direction, becoming more ideological, which reduced Turkey's influence in the region3.
Almost a year later, in 2012. After the victory of the Islamists in the parliamentary elections in Egypt in January, the country's relations with Turkey significantly improved.
  State-level forums and conferences proved this best4.
2012 year. Egyptian President-elect Mohamed Morsi has been seeking to develop relations with Turkey since July.
 He is one of the few high-ranking officials who in 2012 On September 30, he took part in the Assembly of the ruling Justice and Development Party in Turkey in Ankara as a sign of the developing relations established between Turkey and Egypt.
  During the meeting, he once stressed the need to develop bilateral relations5.
2012 year. On October 1, it was reported that Turkey was going to provide a $ 2 billion loan to Egypt, of which $ 1 billion in a very short period of time6.
 The loan was to be provided for 5 years with և 1% interest rate.

The main focus was on economic issues1.
The foreign policy of the two countries during the mentioned period was general in the issue of the Syrian crisis.
 Ankara, "Cairo supports the rebels", called for the removal of Bashar al-Assad.
 In this context, Turkey and Egypt quickly switched to defense cooperation.
 2012 year. Joint naval exercises began on October 7 in the eastern Mediterranean off the coast of Syria.
It was reported that Turkey had concentrated quite rich military equipment in that area.
  There was no information about Egypt.
  The exercise, dubbed the "Sea of ​​Friendship," lasted about a week, during which the Egyptian-Turkish navy developed a plan for joint military action and cooperation2.
2012 year. On November 17, Erdogan visited Cairo to join his Egyptian counterpart, newly appointed Prime Minister Hisham Kandil, in attending the Egyptian-Turkish Economic Forum, during which a number of officials highlighted President Morsi's efforts to pave the way for further Turkish investment in the country.
2013 The first half was a promising period for the strengthening of Turkish-Egyptian relations, during which the Egyptians hoped that the established strongholds could lead to regional development, security and stability.
  However, former Egyptian Foreign Minister and former head of the League of Arab States Amr Moussa believes that if the relations between the two countries develop and strengthen only at the level of the ruling parties, it will not bring any success.
 He believed that relations should be established between the "nations" of the Egyptian and Turkish states.
2013 In February, the President of Turkey once visited Egypt.
Egypt and Turkey planned to double trade between the two countries to $ 10 billion over the next few years5.
 The Egyptian President even expressed hope that Turkish investors would benefit from the opportunities of the Egyptian market6.
2013 In the context of mutual official visits in the first half of the year, the Egyptian side became more active.
  In particular, on May 3, 2013, Pakinam Al-Sharqawi, Egypt's Senior Assistant to the President for Political Affairs, visited Turkey, where he participated in "The State, Society and the Concept of Justice in the Context of the Arab Spring."

  The Minister of Defense and Military Cooperation of Egypt Abd Al-Fatah Al-Sisi paid an official visit to Turkey in 2013. The prospect of military cooperation on May 5 համար to discuss Turkey's interest in making new investments in Egypt.
  Al-Sisi also took part in the "International Defense Production" fair organized in Istanbul under the auspices of the Turkish Defense Ministry.
2013 On May 10, Turkish President Gül received Egyptian Prime Minister Hisham Kandil.
  They discussed the possible activation of bilateral relations in various spheres.
2013 At the end of May, the demonstrations related to Gezi Park started in Turkey and the subsequent events.
  The Turkish government at that time was very busy with the internal affairs of the country, as the issues were already large-scale.
 These events were immediately followed by the July 3 military coup in Egypt.
Turkey has voiced its strongest criticism of the overthrow of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.
  The media reported that the ruling Justice and Development Party in Turkey had close ties with Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood2.
 Turkey has stated that Morsi is still considered the "legitimate president" of Egypt.
 Proof of this could be the fact that during one of his speeches, Erdoանըan showed a four-finger gesture in solidarity with the Islamist demonstrators gathered around the mosque in Cairo3.
For a long time, Turkey was not politically active in the region, but after the introduction of the "zero problems with neighbors" principle, many things changed, and in the eyes of the Egyptians, the rude position of Turkey towards the military that ousted Morsi seemed strange4.
 Such a position of Turkey can be explained not only by the close relations established between Morsi's Islamist "Freedom and Justice" party and AKP officials, but also by strategic reasons.
  The failed coup attempt by Gezi protesters forced Turkey to take a clear stand on the military coup in Egypt.
2013 In his speech on August 28, Erdogan criticized the chief imam of Al-Azhar University for supporting the military.
  He even stated that Turkey does not respect those who "do not respect the supremacy of human rights", referring to the July 3 military coup5.
 In response to the criticism, Al-Azhar reminded Turkey that they did not interfere in the affairs of the Turkish government during the events in Taksim Square, so they expect a similar response from Turkey: [http.

In order not to upset the balance of relations between the two countries1.
After the coup, Egyptian officials accused Turkey of meddling in their country's internal affairs and supporting the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, but official Ankara has consistently stated that it only supports democracy2.
It was said that this political dispute could not harm the volume of Turkish exports to Egypt3, however, a number of economic agreements signed last year were terminated and frozen.
  During this short period of closer relations with Egypt, Turkey did not miss the opportunity to create a large market for Turkish goods.
2013 On November 23, the political tensions between the two countries reached their peak.
 Official Cairo declared Turkish Ambassador to Turkey Hussein Avni Botsali an persona non grata in Egypt, giving him a week to leave the country4.
 Egypt reduced its diplomatic relations with Turkey to the level of Chargé d'Affaires.
  Turkey could not respond in the same way, as Egyptian Ambassador Abd Al-Rahman Salah Al-Din was recalled in August and was not sent back in response to Turkey's stance on the latest developments in the country.
 The decision of the Egyptian authorities was interpreted by the country's Foreign Ministry as the most extreme measure they had to resort to after Turkey did not use the opportunity to change its policy towards Egypt6.
 President of Egypt G. A similar precedent was set during Nasser's rule when the Turkish ambassador was expelled from the country.
 1954 Nasser sent the Turkish ambassador back because the latter had criticized the actions of the "Free Officers" 7.
The Egyptian "Al-Watan" weekly reports that the international members of the "Muslim Brotherhood" continued to meet in Istanbul to discuss the future of the Islamist movement in Egypt8.
  The "Muslim Brotherhood" was accused of planning demonstrations abroad and trying to form a new government.
The prevailing views in the Egyptian society on the issue of severing relations with Turkey were divided into two different issues.

Muhammad Ibrahim Shaker, the head of the parliamentary's foreign affairs committee, stressed that the decision was an adequate response to Egypt's criticism of Erdogan's July 3 coup.
  Adli Mansour, who became the interim president of Egypt, said that Turkey should have ties "with Egypt and its people" and not only with the leadership of certain groups.
  In response to Erdogan's arguments և speeches, a post was posted on Mansour's Twitter page on August 17 alleging that Egypt had decided to sign a document recognizing the Armenian Genocide. "Our Permanent Representative to the UN will sign an international document recognizing the և 1 million Armenian Genocide perpetrated by the Turkish army."
  Mansour's announcement, which has about 80,000 followers on Twitter, was redistributed 365 times in 22 hours.
  It was posted on Arabic-language news sites.
 The announcement provoked heated discussions.
 According to Turkish media, Adly Mansur has no official page on his Twitter account, and the latest news is only a provocation4.
Egyptian official sources did not comment on the statement attributed to the acting president, nor did they fight to delete that "fake" account.
  On the contrary, some sources claim that the page is unofficial and serves to spread the private message of the new Egyptian authorities and to control public opinion.
A number of Egyptian (and not only) newspapers began to remind the Turkish Prime Minister of 1915. The Armenian Genocide5.
 In the article "Armenian Genocide, Erdogan" published by "Al-Ahram", the author called on Turkey to officially recognize the Armenian Genocide, which was committed by Erdogan's ancestors6.
"Middle East Panorama" in its turn "Erdogan. In the article "Forward, forward" he calls the Turkish Prime Minister "morally ugly" because of his policy towards the Arabs7.
A few days before these incidents, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo ։an accused the Egyptian army of committing genocide in his own country.
  Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag said on this occasion that the current powers of Egypt and their decisions have no legal force for Turkey.
Commenting on all this, the director of the Russian Middle East Institute Yevgeny Satanovsky noted. "The situation is very clear. Turkey sharply criticizes the new Egyptian authorities, and Egypt has not missed the opportunity to respond in the same way.

By adopting such a position, the Egyptian authorities automatically turn the large Armenian communities in France and the United States into their lobbyists. ”1
A wide range of Egyptians were in favor of not continuing relations with Turkey, demanding that the country's government sever bilateral diplomatic ties.
  The leader of the coalition of the "National Salvation Front" political forces, Nabil Zaki 2, often speaks about this.
  It was widely believed among Egyptian analysts that Turkish special services were supporting the terrorist attack in the Sinai Peninsula3.
  Al-Manar referred to Turkey's support for terrorist groups in the Sinai Peninsula, Sudan and Libya4.
According to some sources, the Turkish ambassador who was sent back was considered a member of the "Muslim Brotherhood", he headed a huge spy network in the press in the universities և in universities5.
One of the most active and ardent supporters of maintaining relations with Turkey was the Muslim Brotherhood, which warned that severing ties could cause huge economic losses for the country.
  The official print organ of the organization quoted the Turkish Foreign Ministry as saying that "the government that carried out the coup" is being held historically responsible for the move6.
Opponents of severing relations between the two countries said that such a large country as Egypt could not easily sever diplomatic, political and economic relations with key countries in the region, such as Syria and Turkey.
  Turkey is known for its "foreign policy unpredictability", but it plays a key role in the region.
 The foreign policy direction taken by the Egyptian government was considered alarming. It was pressured that the country should not give up the opportunity for dialogue7.
In recent years, due to its anti-Syrian policy, Turkey has found itself in a certain regional isolation, which was emphasized due to its support for the Muslim Brotherhood.
  Today, Turkey also does not stop its attempts to assume the leading unions in the Sunni world, striving to advance in the post-competition with Saudi Arabia.
  Major military-political centers constantly hinder the increase of Turkey's religious role.

Qabslaa rsmla جIjrakhla Rizu Dassam:
Relations between Saudi Arabia were quite tense, despite the rapprochement of the ruling elites in Turkey and Egypt.
  However, with the fall of Morsi, the events began to develop in reverse relative to the previous one.
The current interim government led by the Egyptian military is leading the country's foreign policy to closer relations with Saudi Arabia.
  Immediately after the return of the troops, Russia began to improve its relations with Egypt by offering financial deals, while the United States had rejected Egypt in this matter1.
  Taking into account the fact that Cairo "Moscow" relations have recently developed to some extent, it can be considered that Russia is coming to fill the gap in Turkey's relations with Egypt.
After the aggravation of relations between Egypt and Turkey, billions of dollars in aid began to flow to Egypt from the Arab monarchies of the Gulf, especially from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE.
  Muhammad Morsi spent most of his presidency on Turkish funds to obtain funding.
  However, at present Al-Sisi's economic platform, which is created at the expense of foreign funds, is based mainly on financial support from the Gulf.
 Turning to foreign financial aid to keep the economy from collapsing is becoming Cairo's de facto economic policy.
In conclusion, if Turkey could no longer dialogue with the former Arab regimes, then its relations with certain sections of the Arab society, in particular, the Muslim Brotherhood, were quite eloquent.
 Turkey was trying to introduce the "Turkish model" of the interweaving of secularism and Islamism in its country to the countries that went through the "Arab Spring", especially Egypt, with the aim of increasing its regional role.
  However, there were significant differences between the "Justice և Development" and "Freedom և Justice" parties. In the first case, religion did not spread in the political and social life of Turkey, while the "Muslim Brotherhood" tried to do it everywhere.
 In addition, there is a difference in the political cultures of Islam in the two countries, as Turkey is currently ruled by the Nakhchivan Sufi elite, and Arab Islam Sufism has never been dominant in the political system.
Egypt 2011-2013 Turkey was included in the "list" of friendly countries, and as long as good relations brought economic benefits, Turkey continued its regional integration.
 Turkey's relations with the countries of the region have improved due to economic trends, global movement and Turkey's new "crisis" policy.
It is another matter that due to a number of motives, Turkey was unable to maintain its chosen political line, and Egypt, in its turn, decided not to continue the political dialogue in the current conditions.
After the removal of the ambassadors, Turkey has no significant diplomatic relations with Egypt.
  The seemingly promising relationship between the two potential countries in the region came to an abrupt end.
