Sci. Head: Doctor of Technical Sciences, Prof. H. Sargsyan The reality of corruption is studied both in public life and in economic systems from the political-legal-socio-economic points of view.
Scientific research is being carried out to study the negative effects of corruption on various economic indicators.
  Of particular importance are the studies that look at the level of governance efficiency և public welfare, as well as the increase in socio-economic policy և the level of public welfare in the point-of-control country.
In this context, one of the most well-known works in the economic literature is Norfolk 16's work, the government is a system of man-made restrictions, which has a great influence on the decisions of economic agents.
  Therefore, effective governance, which contributes more to efficient division of labor, attraction of productive investments, socio-economic record higher economic growth.
 On the other hand, according to Holly Ջ Jones17, if good governance contributes to economic growth, then poor governance contributes to low levels of property rights, 16 See North DC, Institutions, Institutional Change, and Economic Performance, New York.

This article's low level of dominance of purpose, non-optimal tax system, high level of corruption lead to inevitable decline in public welfare.
In addition to the above assertions, the numerous expert assessments made show 18 evidence of a positive dependence on governance efficiency and economic growth.
  Such studies include, for example, Alam, Kitenji-Bedan, Achemoglu, Johnson-Robinson, Achemoglu-Robinson, Barro, Naki-Kiefer, Kaufman և Cray, Kaufmann, Cray աստ Mast.
However, on the other hand, corruption processes negatively affect effective governance, the latter leading to a lower level of public welfare.
seeks to present the level of corruption in the Republic of Armenia, as well as its impact on the level of public welfare.
In-state surveys in state and public institutions, as well as throughout the country, are in-depth expert assessments based on those surveys.
These types of assessments include, for example, the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), which is evaluated annually by Transparency International, the Global Corruption Barometer, and so on.

Public opinion assessments on the level of corruption are presented to each sector / institution.
 The level of corruption in each sector / institution is rated on a scale of 1-5, with a score of 5 indicating a high level of corruption in the sector / institution and a score of 1 being the highest of the average global scores for corruption.
Corruption spheres / institutions are assessed.

 In the model, the dependent variables explain the dependent variable by 80.2% (Adjusted R-squared = 0.802).

  The model explanatory variable, the Corruption Perceptions Index, has a positive effect on the dependent variable, the Human Development Index (0.09).
  This means that a unit increase in the corruption perception index (lower level of corruption) will lead to human development (0.09 increase in the higher prosperity ratio).
From the point of view of efficiency, it is necessary to strengthen anti-corruption management. Therefore, the effective development and implementation of Avetisyan Georgik policy իքcontrol, as corruption leaves a significant negative impact on the level of public welfare.
