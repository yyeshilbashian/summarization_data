RODOBACTER SPAHEROIDES INSULATED FROM MINERAL SOURCES IN ARMENIA
 Molecular hydrogen (H2) is considered to be an environmentally friendly fuel that does not pollute the environment with harmful substances.
 At present, the production of biogenic H2 (hydrogen) is of great interest [Gabrielyan, Trchounian, 2009; Hallenbeck et al., 2012; Basak et al., 2014].
  H2 is produced by organisms belonging to different disciplinary groups: chemotrophic bacteria, phototrophic apricot-green bacteria, cyanobacteria, a number of algae.
  Only two groups of photosynthesizers are able to synthesize H2: microalgae իան cyanobacteria by direct biophotolysis, apricot bacteria by photosynthesis of organic acids oxidizing organic compounds (Gabrielyan, Basakian, 2009; al.
H2 production is the result of redox processes (Gabrielyan et al., 2010, 2014; Hakobyan et al., 2012a).
  The ability of bacteria to carry out redox processes depends on the redox potential of the environment (OPS), which in turn depends on the rate of redox reactions (Vassilyan, Trchunyan 2008; Poladyan et al., 2013).
 Anaerobic growth of bacteria is associated with a decrease in negative values ​​from the positive values ​​of OVP, which describes the transfer of electrons through the bacterial membrane և the formation of a proton force (Hakobyan et al., 2012b).
The potential role of OVP has been demonstrated for Escherichia coli, another bacterium growing under anaerobic lactic acid conditions (Soghomonyan et al., 2011; Poladyan et al., 2013).
 Various oxidants and reducing agents have been shown to affect bacterial growth.
 The regenerative DL dithiotreitol (DTT) suppresses the growth of E. coli և lactic acid bacteria (Vasilyan, Trchunyan 2008; Soghomonyan et al., 2011).
 It is assumed that the effect of DTT is due to the direct effect on the environmental OVP և depends on the pH.
  In the case of Enterococcus hirae bacteria, DTT stimulates the growth of bacteria (Poladyan et al., 2013).
A number of metal ions, particularly iron (Fe) ions, being part of many enzymes, also participate in OV reactions.
 At the same time, it is known that excess Fe2 + -i can suppress cell growth (Nies, 1999; Wang, Wan, 2009).
 Under anaerobic conditions, Fe2 + is more stable than Fe3 +.
  Although the exact mechanisms for the penetration of iron ions into the literature to regulate their concentration are not well known in the literature, they have been well studied in E. coli bacteria.
 The Fe2 + absorption system is known to work in anaerobic conditions in E. coli bacteria.
  It is an ABC transporter endowed with great care for Fe2 +, which is secreted by the feoABC genes.
  Fe2 + ion transport is thought to be AED-dependent (Nies, 1999; Ma et al., 2009).
The permeability of Fe3 + is very low, which makes it difficult for it to enter the cell.
Cells contain specific iron-binding proteins that bind to iron and transport it to the cell (Nies, 1999; Ma et al., 2009).
 After crossing the outer membrane, the Fe3 + - protein system binds to specific proteins, which are components of ABC transporters, և transported by the plasma membrane (Ma et al., 2009).
It is known that ions of different metals can be used for the growth and metabolism of most microorganisms (Liu et al., 2009; Wang, Wan, 2009).
 For example, iron is a component of the growth medium of a number of bacteria and is part of the major enzymes responsible for hydrogen production, hydrogenases and nitrogenases.
 The vast majority of hydrogenases are [Fe] - or [Ni-Fe] - hydrogenases, and nitrogenases are composed of [Mo-Fe-Co] և [Fe-S] components (Liu et al., 2009; Wang, Wan, 2009 ).
 In addition, photosynthetic electron transport chain transporters, such as ferredoxin իտ cytochromes, also contain Fe (Liu et al., 2009). There is no data on the effect of various reductants and oxidants on apricot bacteria.
  In this study, the regulation of aphrodisiac bacterium isolated from Rhodobacter sphaeroides MDC6522 cells isolated from the Jermuk mineral spring of Armenia was studied by oxidants of H2 with oxidants (ferricyanide, Fe3 +) and reductants (DTT, Fe2 +).
Studies of the effects of regenerators (oxidants) will allow to find out the general patterns of H2 photoproduction in R.sphaeroides, as well as to clarify the mechanisms and ways of regulating this process.
Object of research և methods.
  In this work, the apricot non-sulfur bacterium R. sphaeroides MDC6522 strain was used, which was isolated from the Jermuk mineral spring in Armenia.
  Bacterial culture was grown under anaerobic conditions in the liquid medium of Ormerod, at 36 V / m2 illumination, at a temperature of 28-300C, in the presence of succinic acid as a source of carbon, yeast extract as a source of nitrogen (Trchunyan et al., 2012; Hakobyan et al., 2012).
  DTF և ferricyanide was introduced into the growing medium at concentrations of 0.1 mM, 1 mM և 2 mM, and FeSO47H2O և FeCl3 at concentrations of 40 μM, 80 μM և 120 μM.
Bacterial growth was measured by measuring the optical density of the suspension using a Spectro UVVis Auto (Labomed, USA) spectrophotometer with 660 nm light wave absorption (OH 660) according to the dry matter mass determination of the bacteria according to the following formula. dry weight (g L-1) = OH 660 * 0.43 (Trchunyan և ur., 2012).
 The specific growth rate (µ) was determined as 0.693 (ln2) և oh ratio ՝ = 0.693 / τ, where τ is the doubling time of the's bacterial suspension's (Trchunyan և, 2012; Hakobyan et al. ., 2012a; Gabrielyan et al., 2014).
The ambient pH was determined using an ionimeter (pH 302, Hanna Instruments, Portugal) and adjusted to 0.1 M NaOH.
 Growth medium pH was maintained at 7.5.
ВПВ-01 type flat-point platinum և ОО-021 titanium-silicate glass electrode were used to measure the ambient OVP.
 The production of H2 is evidenced by the significant difference in the readings of platinum-titanium-silicate electrodes (Trchunyan et al., 2012; Hakobyan et al., 2012a, b).
The output of H2 was calculated according to Piscar վել expressed in mmol / g dry weight (Trchunyan և ur., 2012; Gabrielyan et al., 2014).
 H2 production was determined chemically (Trchunyan, 2012).
Research results և their discussion.
3.1. Peculiarities of growth of R. sphaeroides bacteria in the presence of oxidants և reductants.
  The growth rate of R. sphaeroides bacteria under the influence of various oxidants and reductants was studied (Fig. 1).
  0.1-1 mM DTT inhibits the specific growth rate by 1.2-2.25 times, and at concentrations above 2 mm no growth is observed at all.
  With the presence of Fe2 + (40-120 μM) in the medium, the specific growth rate increased 3.4-4 times compared to the control (Fig. 1).
  An increase in maximum intensity was observed in the presence of 40 μM Fe2 +.
 The following picture was observed in the presence of oxidants in the environment.
 The oxidizing ferricyanide (0.1-2 mM) inhibited the growth 1.3-3 times, and the growth of bacteria under the influence of Fe3 + ions (40-120 μM) was negligible compared to the controller (Fig. 1).
  Inhibition of growth by OV compounds may be due, in part, to their indirect effect on OVPs and, on the other hand, to the interaction of OV compounds with thiol groups of bacterial membrane proteins.
Figure 1. Specific growth rate of R. sphaeroides MDC6522 strain under the influence of OV compounds.
 Bacteria grown in the absence of compounds were used as controls.
Changes in ambient pH are important criteria for bacterial growth (Gabrielyanet et al., 2010).
  During anaerobic growth of control cells (up to 72 h) the ambient pH increases from 7.5 to ~ 9.5 (Fig. 2).
 In the presence of regenerators, an increase in pH is observed in the environment, which may be due to the absorption of organic acids, the production of OH ions, as well as the formation of metabolic products such as polyhydroxybutyrate.
 The pH change is lower in the culture grown with the presence of ferricyanide, and the pH is observed in the presence of Fe3 + (Fig. 2).
Figure 2. Change in ambient pH during anaerobic growth of R. sphaeroides MDC6522 under the influence of OV compounds.
 ∆pH is the difference between the pH of the bacterial growth և 72 h of the initial pH.
3.2. Changes in the growth medium of R. sphaeroides bacteria in the presence of oxidants and reductants.
  OVP is an important criterion for the environment, which can be characterized as the ability of the biological system to oxidize or reduce various substrates (Vasilyan, Trchunyan 2008; Soghomonyan et al., 2011).
 Positive-negative values ​​indicate the restored և oxidized state of biological systems.
Rehabilitation DT, which provides the negative value of the redox potential of the environment (-200 ± 20 mV), stimulates the decline of OVP.
  This effect is concentration-dependent (0.1-2 mM) (Fig. 3a).
  With the presence of 1 mm DT, the OVP decreases to -680 ± 20 mV.
  Meanwhile, the OVP of control cells decreases to 6 -610 ± 10 mV during 72 hours of growth.
  In an environment containing 80 μM Fe2 +, the OVP decreases to 7700 ± 20 mV (Fig. 3b).
 Such a decrease in OVP indicates the stimulation of regenerative processes, which is typical for the growth of bacteria under anaerobic conditions.
 Changes in OVP during bacterial growth indicate the importance of OV processes in bacterial activity.

Modification of DTT և Figure 3. R. sphaeroides MDC6522 Unlike OVP of the medium, the oxidizing ferricyanide provides the ideal OVP of the medium (250 ± 10 mV).
 When the bacteria were grown in the presence of an oxidizer, a drop in OVP pressure was observed (Fig. 3a).
  In a medium containing 1 mM ferricyanide, the OVP decreases to և500 ± 15 mV.
 This effect is also concentration-dependent.
 In the presence of Fe3 + ions, the OVP of the bacterial suspension did not change significantly; this change was similar to the results obtained in the test (Fig. 3b).
Such changes in the above physicochemical parameters may be due not only to fermentation products but also to oxidation processes on the surface of bacterial cells.
The results show the different effects of oxidants and reductants.
3.3. Photoproduction of H2 in R. sphaeroides bacteria in the presence of oxidants և reductants.
 The change in OVP during anaerobic growth of bacteria indicates not only important oxidative processes, but also the production of H2 (Vasilyan, Trchunyan 2008; Hakobyan et al., 2012a; Poladyan et al., 2013).
In these bacteria, a direct link was found between the change in OVP և "H2 production" (Hakobyan et al., 2012a; Gabrielyan et al., 2014).
  The reduction of protons up to H2 is observed under severely reduced conditions.
  As shown in Fig. From 4, regenerative DTR suppresses growth, but stimulates H2 photoproduction in R. sphaeroides.
  In the case of 0.1-1 mm DTT, the output of H2 after 72 hours is 1.35 times higher than that of the controller.
 However, in the presence of 2 mM DTT, H2 production was not observed in the medium during 48 h of bacterial growth, and at 72 h it was almost 3 times lower than the control (Fig. 4).
 It is noteworthy that the production of H2 was not observed in the absence of Fe2 + ions, which indicates the participation of this ion in the production of H2.
 The output of H2 in the medium containing 80 μM Fe2 + was shown to be 10.54 mmol / g dry weight, which was almost twice as high as the output of H2 in the control (40 μM Fe2 + medium) (Fig. 4).
Figure 4. Effect of OV compounds on H2 output during 72 h of anaerobic growth of R. sphaeroides MDC6522.
Photoproduction of H2 is inhibited by the presence of oxidants (Fig. 4).
  When the ferricyanide concentration increases from 1 to 2 mm Hg, the H2 output decreases by 3.3-5 times during 72 h of bacterial growth.
 In the presence of Fe3 + ions, bacteria do not produce H2.
It is clear that redox processes play an important role in the metabolism of R. sphaeroides.
  Most of these processes, which take place in bacterial membranes, depend on OVP.
 The OV compounds used affect the growth of bacteria և H2 production through OVP.
