 On the other hand, the outflow rates of new subscribers attracted by Orange Armenia from November 5 (the day Orange Orange enters the market) to December 31 are reflected to some extent.
There are 3 companies operating in the RA mobile market: "Armenia Telephone Company" CJSC with its "Beeline" brand, "Telecom" CJSC with its "Vivacell-MTS" brand, "Orange Armenia" CJSC with its "Orange" brand.

Figure 4 shows that the number of active subscriber numbers of individual operators has not changed significantly.
  This phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that the market is mature, close to saturation, so the strategies of telecommunications operators need to be developed frequently and changed.
  All mobile operators try to provide high quality voice, text, multimedia և data transfer services.
 The source of operators' income has traditionally been voice (text (SMS) transmission services.
  Today, however, telecom operators have to accept the challenges of the so-called Over TheTop (OTT) services.
OTT services involve the transmission of audio, video and video through traditional Internet services offered by operators.
 Because these service providers do not need to have access permissions or use their technological capabilities for their operations, they are called "Over-The-Top" services.
  "Viber", "Skype", "Volp", which are widely used as examples of similar services. Facebook ձայն voice, video, text messages and calls from other organizations.
  The world's leading telecommunications operators are paying close attention to the challenges of OTT services.
  According to the forecasts of the global organization "Informa Telecoms & Media", the global revenues from "SMS" services in 2018 will decrease to 96.7 billion US dollars per year (instead of 120 billion in 2013) due to the greater use of OTT messaging services 1.
  According to the report "Spirit DSP" published by "Spirit DSP", the global revenues from the voice services of mobile operators by 2020 will fall to 799.6 billion US dollars (instead of 970.4 billion in 2012) 2.
