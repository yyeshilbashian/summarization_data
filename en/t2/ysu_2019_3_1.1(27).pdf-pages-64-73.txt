ANALYSIS OF METEOROLOGICAL DANGEROUS PHENOMENA AND ASSESSMENT IN TAVUSH REGION Agriculture, which is almost entirely carried out in the open air, is considered to be one of the most important spheres of human activity.
The productivity of all objects of agricultural production - crops, animals, land, water - largely depends on the climatic conditions.
 Studies of adverse weather conditions are especially useful for mountainous regions, as changes in the agricultural environment are very rapid here.
The dangers of natural conditions at work have been assessed not only in modern conditions, but also in the context of global climate change.
 The aim of the work is to study the degree of danger of natural emergency phenomena in Tavush region: droughts, hurricanes, frosts, winds, hailstorms, to assess the damages caused by the latter, to indicate the ways to protect or mitigate them.
          Tavush region is located in the north-east of the territory of the Republic of Armenia.
  It is a complex system of rugged mountain ranges, plateaus, deep river valleys, canyons, and intermountainous depressions.
  The relief heights of the region vary from 380 m (Debed valley) to 3000 m (Mount Halab, 3016 m).
 Fragmented mountain relief plays an important role in shaping climatic conditions.
Droughts, gusts, winds, frosts, hailstorms in the territory of the Republic of Armenia, in particular, in Tavush region, are among the most frequently repeated dangerous phenomena, which with significant intensity, in terms of time of occurrence, lineage and spread are significant damage to the economy.
Drought is a complex meteorological phenomenon, which is due to high temperatures (> 25-300), low relative humidity (≤30%), long-term significant precipitation.
The impact of droughts on crop yields depends on many factors, including drought drought, intensity, rainfall, wind speed, vegetation stage, drought resistance, and the level of agricultural machinery used.
Droughts are classified according to their origin into two types: atmospheric and soil.
In case of soil droughts, the plants suffer from long-term absence of rain, lack of useful moisture in the root layer of the soil.
In case of atmospheric drought, the soil may have useful moisture reserves, but the plants suffer from high air temperature աբեր Relatively low humidity.
 In this case, the water requirement of the plant's above-ground organs significantly exceeds the water intake from the root system.
 Atmospheric droughts are usually preceded by atmospheric droughts, which are followed by irreversible effects.
Drought phenomena are observed in Tavush region in all seasons of the year.
 Autumn, winter and spring droughts usually occur in low (20-250) temperature, but long-term rainless conditions.
 During summer droughts the air temperature rises above 25-300 during the day.
  Droughts are especially strong when the amount of precipitation during the vegetation period is 4050% of the norm, the number of dry decades reaches 4-5-5-5, and the average air temperature exceeds 2-8-3-80 normal.
  Severe drought is considered to be 62-70%, 28-32 dry decades և 1․1-2․20 average temperature above normal [1].
Tavush region is distinguished by the minimum number of drought days (Bagratashen, Berd), where precipitation is relatively high and daytime warming is not high (Figure 1 և Table 1).
Figure 1. Atmospheric precipitation in Tavush regionOpen. Altitude, Air temperature meter Table 1. Number of days in Tavush region with 25, 30, 350 temperatures Figure 1 shows that in Tavush region the maximum precipitation (more than 800 mm) falls in the top zone of Gugarats mountains, and the lowest precipitation (up to 600 mm) in the lower reaches of rivers. in the currents at 400-600 altitudes.
Table 1 shows the number of days with high temperature (25-350), which depends on the altitude of the place.
 If at 400 m the number of days above 250 is 118, then at 1600 m it is 37, and at the height above 300 it is relatively 52 և 2 days.
It is interesting to compare these data with other (internal) regions of Armenia.
  Thus, the number of days with temperatures above 250 m at 600 m reaches 98, then in the interior regions - 145 days, etc.
The number of ten days with droughts in Tavush region is given in Figure 2.
As can be seen from the picture, droughts of 20-40 days are observed mainly in the lowland regions of the region, at altitudes of 400-800 m.
  However, it should be noted that in relatively humid climates the drought intensity is quite small compared to the interior regions of Armenia.
The drought and water scarcity observed in Tavush region in 2000 caused great damage to agriculture.

The combined effect of the following air-ithological elements is considered as the criterion of the curve: relative humidity ≤30%, air temperature ≥250 և wind speed ≥5 m / s [2].
Usually, during the penetration of burrows, the crops are in the stage of rapid development, due to which there is a significant increase in yield, and in some cases, the destruction of plants.
 As the cultivation season lasts for several days (up to 5-6), the crop loss depends significantly on the agricultural crop and the level of agro-technical measures.
  The effect of shingles on plants is exacerbated by a lack of moisture in the soil, when a rupture occurs through the "water inlet" that evaporates through transpiration.
The water supply fields are almost unaffected on weekdays, they are reduced to a minimum.
The intensity of the winds is determined by the combination of the wind speed և air saturation deficit (at 1300) (given in Table 2).
Satisfactory deficit values ​​at 1300 h
IntensityLightWeightIntensitive In case of very intense wind speed ≥ 8 m / s <8 m / sTable 2. Determination of wind speeds by a combination of wind speed և air saturation deficit indices In Tavush marz, storm conditions are observed for 25-45 days.
  Weak grooves are mainly observed here [5].
 Intense և Very intense ridges are almost not observed (Figure 3).
Figure 3. Number of days with ridges in Tavush marz The most dangerous, intensive ridges are observed in July-August.
 Studies have shown that if there is a sufficient amount of moisture in the soil (20 mm in 0-20 cm layer, more than 50 mm in 0-50 cm և about 100 mm in 0-100 cm layer), then grain crops, fruits և vines can withstand weak frosts up to 5 days without damage, in case of medium intensity - 3-4, intensities - 2-3 days [4].
In the context of global climate change, the negative impact of droughts on crop yields will intensify.
 A number of measures should be taken to mitigate these effects, to increase crop adaptability, and to provide new technologies.
 Among them, a special place should be given to the circulation of drought-resistant crop varieties, especially in the regions where agriculture is carried out in arid conditions.
 It is necessary to choose varieties that are more genetically resistant to air drought and can provide a normal crop in drought conditions.
 Proper fertilization of crops is possible.
Hailstorm is one of the most dangerous meteorological phenomena in Armenia, particularly in Tavush region, which causes great damage to the economy.
 Along with the increase of the local altitude in the territory of the Republic of Armenia, the number of hail days increases by 1 day / 200 m gradient.
  Most of the hailstorms are observed during the day at 13-2000, and the maximum cases of the day at 1700.
Studying 2006-16. The number of hail cases observed in the territory of Tavush region, we have come to the conclusion that 50% of the registered cases were observed in Dilijan, and the diameter of the hailstone was 6-25 mm.
 During this period the number of hail days in Ijan was 10, and in Bagratashen - 1 day.
The number of hail days in Tavush region is given in Figure 4.
 It is clear that the number of days with hail increases from 1-2 to 10 ըստ more days depending on the altitude.
Figure 4. Number of hail days in Tavush marz The average monthly և annual wind speed values ​​increase in altitude in the marz.
 In the high mountainous regions of the region, the maximum wind speeds (≥20 m / s) are observed in winter, and in the low-lying foothills, due to the mountain valley circulation, in summer, and the minimum in winter.
Late spring and early autumn frosts in the region are mainly conditioned by cold air intrusions from the west and northwest.
  The frost period at the bottom of the depressions is 2-26 days longer than the period at temperatures above 100 ° C.
 During the drought years of the vegetation period, the largest areas in Tavushimarz were affected in 1935, 1941, 1961, 1964, 1985, 2017.
Analyzing 1955-2016. The course of the maximum and minimum temperatures registered by the meteorological stations of Tavush region, it turns out that there was an increase of the minimum and maximum temperatures, making 1․5-2․10 և 1–0–2․00, respectively.
  During the same period, atmospheric precipitation decreased և´ year-round և´ during the vegetation period.
 Studies have shown that in the context of global climate change, there is an intensification of dangerous meteorological phenomena, a high frequency of recurrence and a large spatial coverage.
Summing up the results of the study, we came to the following conclusions: • Tavush region is distinguished by the minimum number of drought days.
In the lowland zone (400-600 m) the number of days with 250 temperatures decreases by 10 days / 100 m, in 600-1000 m - 7 days / 100 m, and in 1400-1600 m - 5-6 days / 100 m.
• Situations in the region are observed for 25-45 days.
Weak ridges are mainly observed, the highest probability of which (90-98%) is observed only at altitudes of 400-800 m.
 The rainfall sharply decreases at 800 m, reaching 7 days.
• Most hailstorms are observed during the day at 1300-2000, and the maximum cases of the day are at 1700.
  2006-16 Hail days in Tavush region make up a large number in Dilijan - 50% of hail cases.
• Monthly և annual wind speed values ​​increase with altitude.
  The maximum values ​​(≥20 m / s) are observed in winter, in the lowland և foothills due to the mountain-valley circulation in summer, and the minimum in winter.
• Late spring և early autumn frosts due to intra-western և north-western cold air intrusions.
  The frost period at the bottom of the depressions is 2-26 days longer than the period of temperatures with temperatures above 100.
 That is, the lower regions of the region are more dangerous.
• Calculations show that in 1955-2016. The "minimum" and "maximum" temperatures increased during the year, respectively 1-5-2․10 ․ 1․0–2․00.
  During the same period, the amount of atmospheric precipitation decreased և´ for a year և´ during the vegetation period.
 This trend continues in the context of global climate change.
 It will lead to intensification of dangerous meteorological phenomena.
