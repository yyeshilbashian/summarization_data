3-BENZYL-4-PHENYL-5-MERCAPTO-1,2,4-TRIAZOL BASED SYNTHESIS OF A NUMBER OF VEGETABLES In the last fifty years, some of the potential problems of medical chemistry have been studied. synthesis [1].
  Of the heterocyclic systems, 1,2,4-triazole derivatives stand out for their biological activity, of which many well-known drugs are widely used: antifungal (Fluconazole, Itraconazole, Ravuconazole, etc.), anti-cancer (Letrozole, Anastinazole (Anastrazole), Estazolam) among drugs as the main therapeutic drugs [1,2].
 Triazoles have aroused great interest and continue to arouse their various biological activities.
  In this direction, work is being done in the Department of Organic Chemistry of YSU Faculty of Pharmacy to obtain new triazole derivatives, which may be of great importance for receiving new antifungal, anti-cancer drugs [3].
Based on the above, the aim of the presented work is to synthesize new 3-benzyl-4-phenyl-5-mercapto-1,2,4-triazole derivatives.
The interaction of 3-benzyl-4-phenyl-5-mercapto-1,2,4-triazole with methyl ester of hydrochloric acid was investigated.
Potash was used as the acid-binding agent in acetonitrile at a molar ratio of 1 mole.
 The reaction was carried out at a temperature of 40 ° C.
  The yield of S- (3-benzyl-4-phenyl-4- H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl) -O-methyl carbonate was 56% .Then, the product was hydrolyzed with 85% hydrazine hydrate solution. 1.
At a ratio of 1.5 mol, at different temperatures of 0-60 ° C in ethanol medium.
  Irrespective of the conditions, the target S- (5-benzyl-4-phenyl-4H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl) hydrazine carbonate does not occur, and the main product of the reaction is 3-benzyl-4-phenyl-5. The interaction of 3-benzyl4-phenyl-5-mercapto-1,2,4-triazole with 3-bromopropionic acid methyl ester was studied to introduce a functional group for the introduction of a functional group.
1.2 in molar ratio under different conditions (solvent: benzene, acetone, methanol, benzene և acetone (1.
1) mixture, bases: potash, triethylamine, lithium carbonate).
  The resulting MRI studies showed that the ester was not actually a mixture of one S-substituent but two N և S-substitutes.
 The reason is that the reaction of hydrogen bromide to form methyl acrylate during the reaction, which leads to the formation of 2-N-substituted esters in triazole. with methyl acrylate 1.
1.5 mol in sodium methylate medium.
 As a result, only methyl-3 - ((5-benzyl-4-phenyl-4H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl) thio) propionate is formed. Continuing the work, methyl 3 - ((5-benzyl- Hydrozinolysis of 4-phenyl 4H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl) thio) propionate, in which the resulting hydrazide was reacted with acetyl acetone in the presence of one drop of concentrated hydrochloric acid.
1 molar ratio, resulting in 95% yield of 3- (3-benzyl-4-phenyl-5-thioxo-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl) propane-1-one containing a triazole-triazole group. In order to synthesize the compound, the interaction of the synthesized hydrazide with phenylisothiocyanate under the conditions described in the literature [4,5] was studied, which led to the formation of the corresponding thiosemicarbazide.
The resulting product was subjected to intramolecular cycling with 10% aqueous solution of KOH, resulting in 96% yield of 5 benzyl-2- (2- (5-mercapto-4-phenyl-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-) il) ethyl) -4-phenyl-1,2,4-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-thion.
Thus, conditions for the synthesis of a number of potentially bioactive compounds have been developed; it has been shown that 3-benzyl-4-phenyl-5-mercapto1,2,4-triazole is a suitable starting point for the synthesis of bioactive compounds.
  The structure of all synthesized compounds was confirmed by MMR և IC spectral analysis data.
