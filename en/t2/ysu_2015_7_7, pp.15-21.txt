SYSTEMATIC, STRUCTURAL AND INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE POPULATION SOCIAL PROTECTION AFTER THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE,
  In the context of the transition process, the development and implementation of such a policy must first be based on an in-depth analysis of the interconnected social systems, interconnected subsystems, structures, elements, as well as social development opportunities and perspectives.
At present, the empirical approach prevails in the field of sociological study of social protection issues of the population of the Republic of Armenia, in particular, mainly sociological research is carried out, which aims to study the socio-economic situation of households, family incomes, living standards of the population, etc.
Accordingly, the video-methodological-practical aspects of the study of the social protection of the population are not yet the subject of a unified sociological analysis.
 Not considering social protection as a social institution, social system, activity aimed at achieving social protection, in fact, impoverishes the possible scientific-practical value of existing studies.
 In transition countries, including Armenia, the need for such a holistic approach in field studies, with limited resources, the inevitability of social crises, and the need to avoid ineffective approaches in practical social policy models.
 Moreover, such an approach has a direct impact on the logical duration of the period required for the "transition" in a transitional country, as shown by the existing processes in Eastern Europe.
It should be noted that the current basis of the empirical approach to the study of social protection makes the social policy based on it primitive, as the latter is almost directly monetary in response to income poverty, ignoring many external and internal factors affecting the system and the implementation of possible mitigators.
Let's try to substantiate why the analysis of social protection of the population can be carried out using structural-functional, systemic-institutional sociological approaches.
In the framework of the systemic approach, the analysis of social protection features is based on the idea of ​​understanding the object as a system.
  This approach gives an opportunity to discover the whole of the object, to discover the multidimensionalities in it ել to unite them in one general theoretical structure.
  The system approach assumes to study all the elements of the system, their external-internal relations, the quality and level of the main objective function of the system, to identify the "challenges" and "dangers" coming from the external environment, both hidden elements of individual elements (components, subsystems) and the whole system. Reserves և Development opportunities.
In the study of social phenomena in modern society, the introduction of the concept of "social subsystem" is used.
 It unites individuals on the basis of one of the functional characteristics of the system, characterized by a high degree of organization.
 When studying social systems and subsystems, it is necessary to emphasize the characteristics that allow to identify the social peculiarities of the latter և to separate the system development criteria.
You. According to Kolesnikov, the key features of the system are the general purpose (s) of the system, the performance of certain functions by each element (which in turn are conditioned by the common purpose, the corresponding tasks), the subordination և coordinates of the elements of the social system, as well as the governing subsystems. the existence of feedback.
 The basic elements of a social system as a whole are people, as well as their connections, interactions and relationships1.
 Moreover, the meaning of the system lies in the ability to achieve the goal, և it is this ability that provides the basis for the further vital activity of the system.
 The system is viable as long as it can set goals և achieve them.
  The role of such a criterion is the concrete result, which the activity of social systems is aimed at achieving.
In order to reveal the unique content of the social protection system of the population, it is necessary to find the original element of the latter.
 As such, the goal is to protect the population from social risks in all cases when they become socially vulnerable, ie the satisfaction of people's vital needs is endangered for various reasons beyond their control.
  Thus, the system is a structurally and structurally unified whole, and the goal, the ability to achieve the latter կարող the ability to achieve the latter երում the result of the factors that ensure the vitality of the social system as a criterion for achieving the goal.
The social protection of the population as a whole is conditioned by the interconnectedness of its subsystems, as well as by the interaction of its subjects.
  In such an organic system, each element presupposes the existence of the other, and 1 See Zamaraeva Z., Социальная защита, Пермь, 2009, p. 13.
According to Walter Buckley, the relationship between the elements is based on more information than energy transfer1.
However, the social protection of the population is an intermediate system. according to U. According to Buckley, intermediate systems are created by social systems, contribute to the self-preservation of the system, and some intermediate systems to the implementation of changes.
  Over time, intermediate systems become more independent, determining the actions of the system2.
The system of social protection of the population, like any highly organized system, in order to function and develop normally, must have certain resources of self-regulation, which will create an opportunity to ensure balance within the system.
  The regulators of the balance of the social protection system of the population are the additional measures of the social policy implemented by the state, which are aimed at easing the tension, contribute to the desired state of the system of social protection of the population և, in fact, additional mitigators that allow to push back more undesirable developments.
The mentioned system has a rather complicated structure. Each element of the system is unique ունի has a certain role in ensuring the social protection of the person.
 Ս. According to Yushkova, the structural elements of the social protection system of the population are social security, social assistance, social assistance և rehabilitation, social work, social benefits3.
In general, within the framework of professional literature, different structural elements of the social protection system are distinguished by different authors.
  The above classification, in our opinion, can be used to solve a problem such as the subordination of the main problems of the social protection system of the population, depending on the needs of the population, first of all, socially vulnerable groups.
Thus, in the context of systemic theory, the social protection of the population is viewed as an organic whole, which is characterized by formation, development and development.
  It has its own patterns of operation և principles, which need to be considered as unique starting points for the analysis to be performed.
As for the context of structural functionalism, the analysis of the social protection of the population should be carried out in the context of the structural functionalism of Talcott Parsons.
  According to T. For Parsons, the survival of any system requires the following 4 functions: • Adaptaion. Thanks to this function, the system is able to overcome or perform random events from the external environment.
2 See ibid., P. 218.
3 See Yoshkova S., Structure and conditions of functioning of effective social protection systems, Moscow, 1997, pp. 10-11.
requirements.
 The system, in essence, adapts to the external environment, just as it adapts the environment to its needs.
• Achieve the goal (goal attainment). Thanks to this function, the system is able to set its primary goals և achieve them.
• Integration. The system must coordinate the interrelationships of its elements և manage the relationships of the other three functional imperatives (A, G, L).
• Latent function (preservation of value samples). Due to this function, the system preserves both the motivation of individuals and the cultural values ​​that create and maintain that motivation1.
In fact, the social protection system of the population also performs the above-mentioned 4 functions.
  Thus, the social protection system solves the problem of rational organization and distribution of material, human and cultural resources, which is similar to the problem of adapting to internal situations and external changes.
  As for the function of achieving the goal, the social protection system develops its goals and promotes their achievement.
 In addition, the social protection system also performs the function of integration through institutions of social control, which create and maintain common norms and values.
  And finally, in order to maintain the existing order, the social protection system of the population must develop mechanisms that promote the process of socialization of the people.
  This process creates certain conditions for both the stability and change of the social protection system of the population.
T. In analyzing this system within Parsons' theory, it is necessary to emphasize the interaction of the main actors providing social protection of the population, the behavior of different actors involved in the development and implementation of social policy, as well as the social context in which policy decisions are made.
 It is also necessary to discuss the relations between the main entities "objects" providing social protection of the population.
The object of social protection is practically the whole population of the country.
  The object of implementation of social programs և measures ultimately become specific people, their associations, which are social protection target groups.
  Traditionally, three such target groups are distinguished: • The whole population (ensuring safety of life, protection of consumer interests, strengthening the health of the nation, etc.), • Individual groups and strata of the population (intelligentsia, servicemen, workers in education, health, culture and other fields), 1 See Ritzer J., pp. 118-119.
• Vulnerable groups of the population (large families, disabled people, unemployed, etc.) 1.
Apart from the state, state agencies և institutions, local self-government bodies, extra-budgetary funds, non-governmental organizations, citizens, etc. act as subjects of social protection.
According to another representative of functionalism, Emil Durkheim, the goal of social protection is to improve the living conditions of the whole society.
  The physical, emotional and economic needs of the members of the society համարsocial, emotional, economic needs must be met in order to ensure the welfare and maintenance of the society2.
Thus, according to functionalists, the goal of social protection is to ensure the normal functioning of all segments of society, thereby ensuring the stable operation of the entire social system.
 In fact, functionalists see the goal of social protection in improving the living conditions of the most vulnerable group, as well as of society as a whole.
 These ideas are also discussed within the framework of Robert Merton's structural functionalism3.
As for the application of the institutional approach in the study of this or that social phenomenon, it is quite well-founded և scientifically substantiated4.
 The study of the social protection of the population in the context of the institutional approach, first of all, presupposes that the present institution exists in the modern society and influences the change of the specific conditions of the society.
 In addition, this institution is one of the inseparable elements of the social sphere of public life.
In fact, social protection, being a rather complete system by its functional nature, is an independent social institution, which is characterized by certain peculiarities due to the technologies of services provided within the latter.
  Social protection of the population is a social institution because: • It is a stable reproductive form of social interaction, due to which every society uses its own forms of social protection based on its level of development.
• Social protection is characterized by the totality of normative legal acts, as well as the norms of moral norms formed in the society.
• Social protection is characterized by professional ադր personnel, ie special professional knowledge and skills work in the social protection system 1 has skills 1 See Rodney A., Impacting social policy.

Specialists, there are institutions that train such specialists, etc.
• Social protection is characterized by a certain internalization of social norms and expectations. Those who provide social protection, as well as those to whom social protection is addressed, have a certain form of attitude towards this social phenomenon.
Every society cares to one degree or another for the social protection of its members.
  The responsibility for solving this problem lies directly with the institution of social protection, which, as a social institution, is a set of legal norms aimed at solving certain socio-economic problems.
  In the international context, social protection is usually related to certain categories of citizens who, due to loss of ability to work, lack of work or other reasons, do not have the means to meet the living needs of their disabled family members.
 Within the framework of the Institute of Social Protection, those citizens who find themselves in unfavorable situations in accordance with the legislation are provided with assistance in the form of natural resources, as well as various services.
  In addition, the institute of social protection assumes the implementation of preventive measures aimed at preventing adverse situations.
 Social protection is implemented through various organizational and legal forms, including individual responsibility of employers, social insurance, targeted social assistance, state social security, etc.
 The use of this or that organizational legal form of social protection can cause various economic and social consequences, the prediction of which can be achieved in the process of choosing the means to achieve the goal.
Thus, in our opinion, social protection should be viewed as a social institution, social system - activity aimed at achieving social protection, which allows to enrich, refine the current "need-response" package of empirical studies and social protection policy based on them.
  This issue is especially relevant in the context of the current radical reforms in the sphere of social protection of the Republic of Armenia.
  It is obvious that the unsolved problems of theoretical and conceptual nature are directly reflected in the implemented social reforms, endangering their effective implementation.
