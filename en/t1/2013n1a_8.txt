The study of world experience shows thatduring different stages of economic development , theeffective implementationnot only of monetary policy, but also of the fiscal policy of another important macroeconomic instrument is of great importance.  Both monetary and fiscalpolicy are important components of the general economic policy of the state .The latter is a complex of functions performed by the state,aimed at the regulation of economic processes, regulation, andthe provision of defined target indicators.
Although the theoretical basis of fiscal policy has been sufficiently studied, the directions of scientific research in this field of economics have not yet been exhausted.There are a number of potential unresolved issues in  this area , theimpact of which on the economy requires both their prompt andeffective solutions and thefurther improvement of the theoretical basis of fiscal policy . The development of new approaches to fiscal policy, especially after the recent financial and economic crisis, isespeciallyneeded in order to overcome its negative effects and be more prepared for further similar challenges .
Fiscal policy is a set of financial functions by the state aimed at generating government expenditures and revenues.  It is a set of state measures in the field of public expenditure, tax policy, change of state budget indicators and management, aimed at economic growth, full employment, as well as the balance of payments.Fiscal policy, as aneffective and influential method of influencing the economy   , has been most prominent since the 1930s, and the development of its economic base is largelylinked to the eminent British economist John Maynard Keynes.Keynes և later he's his ideological supporters of the state
Themost important role of fiscal policy has been attributed to the stabilization and growth of the economy , to ensuring full employment at the level of prices. At theheart of their economic research, Keynesians view aggregate demand based on the idea that it is through it that aggregatesupply is formed .  According to this theory, the reduction of tax ratesleads to an increase in gross demand, which, in turn, increasesreal GDP, raises market prices.  As a result, inflation rates are also rising, andshort-term government budget revenues are declining, ը itsdeficit is growing .
Contrary to this view, proponents of the "supply economy" believe that aggregate supply shapes aggregate demand; in their view, Keynesian theory does not take into accountthe impact of taxes on aggregate aggregate supply.Proponents of this economic theory argue that tax cuts stimulate aggregate supply, increase state budget tax revenues, and thus reduce budget deficits.However, not all economists agree with this view. It is true that tax cuts can lead to higher tax revenues, but it takes a long time, while the impact on gross demand is
more short-term nature և more visible.  In economic theory, both of these opposing approaches are used,the dominance of either of them in terms of practical applicationdepends on the economic situation of a particular country, the economic policy adopted by the state.The main targets of modern fiscal policyare economic growth - full employment,leveling of disproportionate territorial development, socio-economic development of the country,etc. It should be noted that in order to characterize the fiscal policy of the state, it isnecessary to find out its specific goals.  Onecan distinguish from the latter . - Reduction of cyclical economic fluctuations,- Overcoming the effects of financial andeconomic crises , - Ensuring economic growth,- Reducing inflation or maintaining its corresponding rates, -Ensuring full employment, etc.The primary goal of fiscal policy is to attract and concentrate monetary resources for the generation of state revenues in the appropriate funds, through which theeconomic, including financial policy of the state is implemented .Naturally, the most important of such funds is the state budget. The latter is the state financial plan for a certain period (usually one year), which consists of state revenues և expenditures.
 Moreover, their detailed structure is reflected in the state budget.The essence of an effective fiscal policy is reflected inthe accurate planning of the state budget, which is ensured bythe precise definition of the tax system և budget directions of expenditures.Public spending և The tax system are the most important tools for regulating the economy.  Through the latter, it is possible tomanage GDP growth according to the set goals և indicators,as public expenditures և taxes have a direct impact on gross income, gross demand, production volume, employment.
 It can be said that at present the tax system has turned from a means of generating state revenues into atool to influence gross demand, which, naturally, isconditioned by the developmentof the economic management system and economic progress.Impact on the economy through fiscal policy instruments is done by direct և indirect methods.  Themain direct method   is budget regulation through theprovision of appropriate revenues and expenditures.  By indirect methods, thestate influences the financial opportunities of economic entities to increase the gross solvent demand in the country.
 By changing tax rates,providing various tax benefits, changing the tax-free income threshold, the stateensures the preferred level of gross demand, stable production volumes, and most importantly, appropriate indicators of economic growth.Taking into account the above, it is customary to distinguish between discretionary and non-discretionary directions of fiscal policy.  Discretionaryfiscal policy is the purposeful manipulation of taxes and expenditures by the state in order to change production, employment, control inflation, and accelerate economic growth.
  Methods of this policy include changes in tax rates, such as volume changes in state support programs, public procurement, and various state-funded programs. In unfavorable socio-economic situations, the state uses various tools of discretionary fiscal policy to alleviate social tensions,provide additional material support to vulnerable groups of the population ,prevent further decline in production , and reduce unemployment.Various tax benefits are applied to  prevent a sharp decline in the income of businesses , such as
Certain tax rates are being revised.Discretionary policy is also implemented through statetransfers and purchases. The change of the latter directly leads to a direct change of gross expenditure, whichin turn leads to an increase in gross demand. The nature of discretionary fiscal policy, the use of this or that tool, mainlydepends on the economic situation in the country, theeconomic policy pursued by the state .Within the framework of fiscal discretionary policy, there are the following financial correlations:1. Increasing government spending increases aggregate demand
both private consumption and investment growth through the resulting increases in production capacity and employment,2. Income tax increase reduces economic entities and population and the resulting reduction in aggregate supply,which in turn leads to a reduction in production and a rise in unemployment .As a result of the economic downturn, particularly the financial and economic crises, the state is pursuing an expansionary fiscal policy, which is reflected in the discretionary fiscal policy with a significant increase in public spending and a reduction in tax rates.  Basically like this
The policy assumes a significant deficit of the state budget, but on the other hand, it allows to prevent a significant decline in production.As a result of the increase in public spending, there is a so-called "exclusion effect" as a result of competition between the state and private investment, as well as the redistribution of production factors infavor of the state.  The increase in government spending ultimately leads to anincrease in market interest rates, which in turn contributes to a reduction in private investment. The reduction of the latter contributes to the outflow of capital, has a negative impact on economicgrowth and the living standards of the population in the country .  This policy:
efficiency depends on thedefinition of the optimal amount of public spending . On the contrary, in the period of economic growth, the state fiscal discretionary policy aimed at curbing additional demand and maintaining price stability is pursued by reducing public spending and increasing taxes.  When implementing such a policy, the state budget is usually additional.The revenues collected exceed the planned expenditures.Non-discretionary fiscal policy presupposes a change in the net tax revenues of the state budget as a result of a change in the volume of national production. Basically, government spendingև taxes change automatically.  This is usually the result
progressive tax rates և state transfer system. Non-discretionary fiscal policy operates independently due to internal market regulators.  The latter are market mechanisms operating independently of the state policy, through which the ups and downs of the economy are significantly leveled.The peculiarity of internal regulators is that tax rates are correlated with the level of income, for example,income tax, profit tax, etc.  The change in tax revenues, depending on the change in the level of income, is a consequence of the external regulators.  During the period of high GDP growth, tax revenues increase, provided that:
The tax system is progressive. As a result, thepurchasing power of the population is limited , which, in turn, inhibits economic growth. And in the period of economic decline, the exact opposite process takes place.  As we can see, internal regulators are important tools for economic stability.  They, being important components of the state fiscal policy, mitigatethe undesirable fluctuations of production volumes and employment, but do not eliminate other unfavorable consequences of volume production changes. Internal regulators mainly affect production volumes, price levels and market interest rates.
  When aggregate demand is reduced, domesticregulators prevent drastic changes in production volumes. Their impact is reflected in the cyclical surplus or deficit of budgets.Discretionary-non-discretionary fiscal policies are appliedtaking into account the specifics of the economic policy pursued by the state, as well as the possibilities of applying direct or indirect financial instruments and methods of economic regulation. The effectiveness of the state fiscal policy largely depends on its timeliness andability to respond to economic situations in a timely manner.Its use for purely political purposes, as well as externally
Crisis situations in the economic environment reduce the effectiveness of the state fiscal policy in the country. That is why before launching this or that direction of fiscal policy, the peculiarities of external and internal   economic situations, as well as the peculiarities of those policies, are taken into account, taking into account theaccurate assessment of their possible impact on the country's economy .Fiscal policy, as mentioned, is implemented through its toolkit. The latter includes the economic mechanismsthat ensure theimplementation of the goals set by the fiscal policy .  They are among the tools of fiscal policy State subsidies և transfers, state purchases, changes in taxes և their rates, definition of new taxes.Each of these tools has a different impact on the economy.For example, changes in different tax rates have differenteffects on both economic indicators and the incentives that driveeconomic growth. The use of different forms of public spending also has different effects on the economy,as the multiplier effect is different. For example, it is natural that the increase in the country's defense spending willaffect the economy in another way, and the increase in state transfers in another way.
  Depending on the corresponding stage of the economic cycle, inwhich the country's economy is in the given period,առանձնահատ the peculiarities of the state economic policy, the fiscal policy tools find different applications.Particularly in the period of economic downturn, the tools of stimulus and expansionary fiscal policy can be:- Reduction of taxes, as well as the abolition of some types of taxes,- Increase of remittances, - Increase of state procurement volumes.One of the tools of restrictive fiscal policy can be distinguished:-reduction ofpublic procurement, -increase of tax rates, as well as introduction of new taxes,
- Reduction of state transfers.Of course, there are also other infrequently used fiscalinstruments, in particular public works, which the state organizes by involving the temporarily unemployed to ensure an appropriate level of employment, agricultural subsidies provided toensure an appropriate level of income in the agricultural sector , and so on.Now let's refer to theanalysis of the peculiarities of the pre-crisis and post-crisis fiscal policy in Armenia. It shouldbe noted that the fiscal policy implemented in Armenia before the financial and economic crisis, after 2004, was restraining.
 Due to this policy, the aggregate supply was significantly restrained, aswell as the state budget deficit was reduced, which was the right direction inthe given period of economic growth. As a result, it was possible to reduce the debt / GDP ratio.  Thus, if in  2000 the foreign public debt was about 45% of GDP, then in the following years this indicator had a steadydownward trend վերջին at the end of 2008 it reached 13.2%. This greatlycontributed to the possibility of attracting new financial resources in the future inorder to overcome the negative consequences of the financial and economic crisis .
 It should be noted that the fiscal restraint policy was accompanied by a mildly restraining monetary policy. However, it is appropriate to note that despite the application of a restrictive economic policy, in the economy, nevertheless, until 2008.Some overheating has been observed.  The actual state fiscal policy during that period was restrained, but not enough. This was mainly due to the low level of tax collection, lack of competition in some sectors of the economy,rigid prices, as well as some shortcomings in the implementation of structural reforms in the economy.
 These circumstances significantly reduce the resilience of the economy to crisis situations, the multipliereffect of fiscal policy . As a result, in the stage of economic growth, the economy is more likely to overheat, and in times of crisis, the level of economic decline is deeper.The effects of the financial and economic crisis on the Armenian economy began to be clearly manifested in October 2008. The peculiarity of the impact of the crisis in Armenia was that itsprimary impact, that is, the panic of the financial markets, the liquidity of banks and other financial institutions werenot addressed. This was largely due to the fact that in Armenia
The fund sector of the financial market is not so developed, it is explained by the fact that the Central Bank of Armenia used a rather strict policy of control over financial institutions.However, the secondary impact of the financial and economic crisis was observed in Armenia, which affected the economy in the following four directions:- significant reduction of private remittances from abroad,-decrease in prices of raw materials, especially metals , -   decline inexports of goods and services, because of,
- Decrease in the volume of investments entering the Armenian economy as a result of liquidity problems of financial assets in the world economy.In the above-mentioned conditions, the economic growthdecreased from the double-digit indicators of the last years of 2008, making only 6.8%. And already in 2009, the negativeeffects of the financial and economic crisis began to appear more vividly in the Armenian economy .  According to the RA National Statistical Service,in January-April 2009, compared to the same period in 2008, a 9.7% economic decline was registered.To overcome the negative consequences of the crisis, to avoid further deeper decline, both fiscal and monetary
Policies should be expansionary, iein the event of a reduction in private sector spending, the public sector should becost-effective to meet the required level of demand andcounteract the impact of reduced financial inflows. Due to the global nature of the crisis,it was largely possible for all countries to pursue stimulating macroeconomic policies, including fiscal ones. Only thestimulus policy of one or a few countries would be accompanied by an increase in the import of those countries, slowing down and in many cases failing the process of restoring economic activity.  It should be noted that almost all developed
The big countries also adopted a macroeconomic expansion policy, which, we think, will help to overcome the negative consequences of the crisis quickly.There was also a need to coordinate fiscal and monetary policies within the economies of individual countries. In particular, thereduction of bank interest rates through the use of monetary policy instruments alone was not yet sufficient to significantly stimulate aggregate demand, asthe cautious approach to lending by the banking system hindered the effectiveness of interest rate transmission mechanisms when risks to the economy increased. In this situation, there was more than enough demand
a direct stimulus policy, the effective version of which was the expansionary fiscal policy.  In this case, too,the increase in governmentdebt through the expansion of government bonds could lead to an undesirable increase in long-term interest rates.  In such conditions, there is aneed to implement a systematic monetary and fiscal policy. In particular, in addition to lowering interest rates, central banks were required to conductlarge-scale direct bond   purchases to prevent long-term interest rate hikes.  "Naturally, he was used extensively to pursue an expansionary macroeconomic policy."
Financial support of international organizations որ donor countries.In order to mitigate the effects of the global financial and economic crisis, theGovernment of the Republic of Armenia adopted the following principles of macroeconomic policy.•Enhancing communication with the public արար business environment և to send the right signals and toform common objective expectations in the economy ;   •Implementation of expansionary fiscal and monetary policy to support the real sector of the economy .In the conditions of economic decline, the implementation of anti-cyclical fiscal-monetary policy is used.  With
In addition, macroeconomic and financial stability,as well as the elimination of the above distortions in the economy, are preconditions for the effective implementation of the anti-cyclical policy .Based on the above-mentioned principles ofeconomic policy , the expansionary economic policy of the government has proceeded in the following directions:• Implementation of infrastructure projects, which would directlycontribute to domestic demand, consequently, economic growth andjob creation;• Targeted assistance to enterprises with temporary financial difficulties; • Improving the business environment և Supporting small and medium-sized businesses in their activities by eliminating existingbarriers;• Consistentimplementation of socially oriented budget expenditures to alleviate social pressures և Publicpessimistic expectations.For the effective implementation of the above-mentioned strategic tasks, we believe that at the present stage,thefollowing tactical measures are widely used and implemented in the field of fiscal policy pursued by the Government of the Republic of Armenia .1. Reduction of VAT rate - up to 15%, which will contribute to both thereduction of prices in Armenia and the increase of business activity
մանը or to stimulate aggregate demand.2. Establishment of differentiated progressiveprofit tax rates, and reduction of profit tax rate for small and medium enterprises up to 15%.3. Increasing the amount of personal deductible from the income tax, up to50,000 AMD, in other words,raising the non-taxable threshold for income tax .4. Revision of income tax rates.  In particular, in terms of low-middle income (up to 200,000 AMD) reduction of the rate to the level of 7%, which will greatly contribute to the growth of consumption by the majority of the population. Instead, high-income earners (AMD 1,000,000 or more)
setting progressive high rates for.5. Review of the list of economic entities taxed with fixed payments.6.Establishment of state guarantee funds to assist companies operating in the real sector of the economy in attracting financial resources .7. Providing tax exemptions to newly established companies, and in case of creating a small or family business, also exemption from taxes in the first two years.8. Increasing the amount of unemployment benefits.9. Organization of public works by the state for unemployed persons վճար payment for them in the amount of average salary.10. Large-scale retraining for the unemployed
Organizing and launching educational programs.11.Co-financing interest rates on mortgage loans to activate the real estate market .  Similar measureshave already been launched, especially for young families andscientists, but the interest rates on these loans are stillquite high, the terms of use are limited, sothey are not widely available to everyone. It would be expedient toimplement such programs for other segments of the population, toreview both the interest rates andthe terms of loans with such support .12. Previously formed overdue tax liabilities
full forgiveness, provided that the companies will continue their activities and create new additional jobs.13.Providing tax benefits to new companies creating additional jobs .14. Provision of financial support and tax benefits to export-oriented enterprises.15. Establishment of free economic zones, mainly tosolve theproblems of disproportionate territorial development in the remote regions of the Republic of Armenia , to develop the productive and social infrastructure of those territories, as well as to preventthe emigration of labor .16. Further simplification of tax administration ապահովEnsuring transparency .
We believe that the implementation of the above-mentioned measureswill make the fiscal policy implemented by the Government of the Republic of Armenia even more effective and targeted, will ensure sustainable economicgrowth for the Armenian economy in the near future.
