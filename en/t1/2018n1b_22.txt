Recent linguistic research has consistently focused on new concepts of German և English և linguistic commonalities, their interactions at different language levels, and the methodology of the content of German as a first և second foreign language course.
 Therefore, the urgency of this topic is conditioned by the need to develop a new methodological concept of German as a second foreign language university course և norms, where their practical importance is given to the practical use of two languages, German և English։.
Thus, the aim of this topic is to show the role of German in the context of modern globalization in the modern world, the similarities between German and English, to assess the practical significance of English language transfer in the development of the content and methodology of German as a second foreign language course.
In the age of modernization (globalization) in the modern world, the socio-economic importance of a foreign language is becoming more and more important, which leads to the transformation of languages ​​in terms of creating global communication preconditions.
 Under these conditions, widespread English becomes "power by other means" (The Econom, 2001).
  It permeates all walks of life, primarily through the Internet.
 Consequently, English words and phrases are now in large numbers in all languages ​​(especially European languages).
 For example, a closer look at the German vocabulary reveals that at the verbal level the boundaries between German and English are not stable today, despite the fact that German has a special place in the Indo-European language family, the mother tongue of all Germanic languages.
 There are many factors that drive language interactions and interactions.
 One of them is political, economic, cultural contacts, which can often be a source of language changes and penetrations.
  Communication can be reflected at all levels of language.
  In today's globalized world, linguistic communication has become commonplace, which necessitates the transition to common language standards.
Such a tendency has a direct impact on the German language ընդհանուր the general concept of its teaching, forming a "language policy", at the core of which is the spread of German in the world, its increasing role, the strengthening of world positions.
Due to the latter, German continues to be one of the most popular foreign language learners in the world, which is due to the leading position of the German-speaking countries in the fields of science, education and economy.
 Thus, German and English, coexisting on the same cultural level, have many commonalities, the registration of which can significantly contribute to the practical learning of German.
 This circumstance should be introduced in the basis of the development of the methodology of German as the content of the second foreign language course, as in the Armenian educational system German is mostly taught as a second foreign language, any second և next foreign language inevitably bears the influence of the first language Weinrich describes it as a deviation from accepted linguistic norms, which occurs as a result of linguistic communication [3,22].
Thus, English language և literature, translation work in English-Armenian, English-Russian sections, the practical course of German as a second foreign language becomes especially effective on the basis of such methodology.
 German as a second foreign language for learners whose mother tongue is Armenian is especially important in English, as in this case the mother tongue has no similarities with German.
  Meanwhile, English offers many opportunities in that context.
 As many observations show when teaching German as a second foreign language, learners are more likely to turn to English if they do not know anything about German.
 From this point of view, the comparison of the linguistic-structural levels of the two languages ​​becomes even more important, as it can be a favorable basis for linguistic research in the later stages of learning.
Recent observations of German as a second foreign language course in practice confirm that it requires a different methodological approach.
  Priority is given to the inclusion of German-English commonalities, which in turn leads to the phenomenon of language transmission3.
  Moreover, the transfer of English to German as a second foreign language course can be positive or negative.
 In both cases, 3 Transfer in this context implies the principle of transmission of linguistic phenomena, according to which the realities of one language can be transferred to another language.
և´ Positive, և´ negative, transmission phenomena can have a positive impact on the learning process if properly monitored.
Here, however, there can be no unequivocal assessment.
 There are two traditional approaches to this issue: in one case, the effects of transmission, positive or negative, are often not observed; consequently, do not involve foreign language teaching; transmission potential in foreign language teaching [4, 4-5].
Here, in fact, the teacher factor becomes primary.
The task of the latter becomes to expand the process of teaching a second foreign language with the results of the latest research, concepts, creating new perspectives, providing appropriate tools.
  There is a new requirement for the teacher, which implies the possibility of choosing new methods of presenting the content of the material.
Thus, transference phenomena of teaching German as a second foreign language can be observed at all language levels: phonetic, verbal, grammatical, such as: • Equivalent sounds at the phonetic level, such as pronunciation, writing, composition and meaning. Tanzen / to dance, der Elefant / the • Latin script; • Existence of a definite և indefinite article նման Principles of such use • Equivalent models of sentence. Er ist krank./ He is ill. Es ist kalt./ It is • Generalities of the composition of tenses: three main forms, series of sounds. kommen-kam-gekommen / come-came-come, composition. have + Participl II / haben / sein / + Partizip II; • Weather verbs. Müssen / must, können / can, dürfen / may.
Many of the other phenomena listed above can be used as a basis for instilling a conscious approach to a second language in German as a second foreign language course, thus reducing the negative impact factor of the first language.
  While the conscious transmission of the realities of the first language leaves an unequivocally positive effect, in this case it is about the phenomenon of verbal transmission.
 The positive transfer of language knowledge, abilities and skills to a second foreign language ensures its rapid and effective assimilation.
 In this case, the initial attitude towards the language is no less important.
It is necessary to develop a positive attitude towards German among students at this stage, refuting the stereotypical approach to the insurmountable difficulties of the given language, showing that it is at the level of their cognitive knowledge.
 The presence of a large number of English words in German is considered a factor in this regard.
  English studies were singled out within the framework of the German language course as a second foreign language.
 English elements in German are characterized by one common definition - "Denglisch".
  Such penetrations in the German vocabulary are assessed negatively, which is due to a number of factors.
However, without referring to the use of English words in the general linguistic imagery of German, it should be noted that many of them come from different historical periods and are also used in other European languages.
 The latter are characterized by the term "international words".
 Such elements predominate in the vocabulary in economics, sports, politics, science, press, technology, spheres.
 English և international words are included in the German vocabulary, adapting to the phonetic-grammatical rules of the language.
  Moreover, they are adapted to the German language rules to different degrees - full և partial adaptation.
 For example, park, café, politik, auto, Physic, arm, hand, address, emotion, bus, hotel, և many other nouns in German get capital letters, article, gender և, respectively, are derived by the corresponding derivation: der Park, das Café, the Politics, the Auto, the Physics, the Arm, the Hand, the Address, the Emotion, the Bus, the Hotel.
 To surf, to download, to check in, to checkout և other verbs in German get an indefinite derivation ending, sometimes և verbal prefixes և are pronounced with facial and numerical corresponding suffixes: surfen, downloaden, einchecken, auschecken.
  By the same token, we can list many words with other idioms, which, adapting to the linguistic rules of German, are nevertheless perceived as international words or English words.
 They make up a large number in the German vocabulary, the tendency to increase them is constantly growing.
International words և English can, if given correctly, significantly contribute to the development of a basic knowledge of the interest in the language.
 In the initial stages of language learning, the goal can be achieved among students through a collaborative method.
  For example, it is possible to form 2 or 3 groups of 10-15 student groups.
  In the period after the game (10-15 minutes) after explaining the rules of the game, students should write as many international words as possible, which are already familiar to them from their German course, are also used in other languages, such as Russian and sometimes Armenian.
  At the end of the time, the instructor checks the results of each team, corrects և counts the points.
  The winning team submits the vocabulary list, then the competing team or teams complete the vocabulary with unspoken words.
  The instructor introduces their German equivalents, if any, into the correct pronunciation of the given words in German, thus enabling students to supplement their vocabulary with words of բառ make the lesson more interesting և informal.
In the same way, some questions of German grammar can be introduced, as can be seen from the examples above.
 The interrelationship between the two languages ​​also has a beneficial effect on the examination of some English language problems.
 In this case, a possible factor is the teacher's knowledge of English as a second foreign language.
In this regard, it should be noted that the international words և English are only a part of the interaction between the two languages ​​երկու.
 It should be added that the many similarities between German and English have more depths at different linguistic levels, which is clearly revealed in the typological comparison of the two languages ​​at different levels.
 The first, the main precondition is the kinship between the two languages.
English, as a separate language, descended from Germanisch, undergoing many changes at different stages of its historical development [2,5-8].
 Therefore, the similarities and similarities between these languages ​​are conditioned by the existence of a common mother tongue, belonging to the same language branch in the same language family, which could not remain without its direct influence at different stages of language development.
