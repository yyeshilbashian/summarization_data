Bisexuality is related to the grammatical order of the verb gender, in particular gender changes տեղ is expressed in the dictionarywith a unit verb that combines differentThe idea of ​​genders without additional lexical-grammatical changes [1, 672].
Bisexuality, as a feature of the grammatical order of the verb gender, or is specific to the Armenian verb system historicallyin all stages of development, not fully studied ուսումնասիր continuesto demand an in-depth և complete examination with practical և theoretical generalizations.
The examination of heterosexual verbs can be done according to different principles, one of which is the study of the composition of the initial basis.
 The starting point, as we know, from a word-formation point of view can be simple orcomponent, presenting all types of Armenian word formation.
Our study aims to single out the consonant verbs of Old Armenian with word-based suffixes:to verify Grabar in the number of about 500 double-sex verbs in 1 (absolutemost of them are simple in composition) as well as the specific weight of the latter, as shown by this or that word-formation suffixFrequency of use in different sub-regions of ancient Armenian.
How to choose the original copies we used as:From the sources we studied։ from the dialects of the works of the 5th-7th centuries, as well as from the dictionary articles of the New Haykazyan dictionary.
We tried to group the Grabar verbs in question in Grabaraccording to classical-post-classical-pre-middle sub-periods2.
We made this division with reservation - for the first time an experimentby presenting the classical Grabar շրջան to the regions following itBisexual verbs with a certain classification.
Such an approach can find out whether it is possible to form or neutralize heterosexuality in a relatively short period of the historical development of a language, such as the classical-post-classical period, or not.
1 See H. Zakyan, Old Armenian double-sex verbs. temporary examination
Gyumri, 2015.
2 This approach, of course, can be controversial, as done by the MekhitaristsSome linguists do not accept the division, arguing that the arguments put forward for such a division are not examined [3, 28].
Thus, a certain number in the consonantal verbs of Old Armenianare basically with a word-formation / non-verbal / suffixbisexual verbs.
It has been proved that suffixes mainly appear in the prescriptive period of a language, from independent words, with the result of "wear and tear" of the latter.
  Derivatives of language in the written languagethey become stronger and more stable.
 That is why a relatively small number of suffixes are created in the written language [2, 177].
Most of the Grabar suffixes originated in Armenianin the circle.
 Among those suffixes are -avor, -at, -ats, -akan, -gin, -yan, -i, -urd, vet, -ot, -ak, -ayn, -aran, -ord, -ich և etc.
To be formed in ancient Armenian with the basics of such suffixesare verbs in which a number of consonantal verbs combining the corresponding meanings nb and ch are formed.
The latter, as the study shows, are classicIn the sources written in Old Armenian they make 1 small number. with the suffix -2: to enlighten, direct, force, arm, perpetuate, with- և ar- with prepositions: to advance, to advance, to pause, -at: to shorten, to divide, -ord: to follow, to lead, to announce, -ot, -ak , with suffixes: rust, accumulate, confuse, unjust և etc.
Let us bring the corresponding original examples: illuminate-nb-lightto spread, to fill with light, to find out. Enlighten my multitude with baptism (Ag.,
426), not to publish. They were mixed with God in abundance
և enlightened (Ag., 352).
  Straighten, adjust directionto give Zirs directed that it should not be according to the law [4, 457], not to be corrected. With
Virtue, though we do not direct, we marvel [4, 547].
 To become a soldier, to arm. He thought of enlisting all the freedmen of the Armenian Imperial Pension (PB, 198), of becoming non-soldiers, of arming himself. Who?
never retires with a soldier (1 Corinthians 9: 7).
 Permanent - nb-extend. Let winter be like this, when the sun in the south perpetuates its senses
1 We mean Hr. About 40 sources separated by Acharyan.
2 This suffix is ​​one of the most frequently used suffixes in the Armenian written period.
  V. Arakelyan counted 114 words in the Bible with a suffix (see V. Arakelyan, The Language and Style of Armenian Translated Literature of the Fifth Century, Yerevan, 1984, p. 95).
[4, 291], to become eternal, to be eternal… only to the same eternal [4, 291].
  Cut-nb-Make short, shorten. Cut the word ևto shorten [4, 1074] not to be shortened, to be late, to be late. Woe to us, becauseshortened (Jer. 6: 4).
  Rust-nb- make rusty. Wine is rusty
zmitsn [4, 831], not rusted. Do not rust against the stone for loss (Love 29,
13) և etc.
Note that the non-verbal words underlying the verbs have a high frequency of use in Old Armenian և conditionThe semantic structure of a verb.
The fact that the composition of verbal words from nouns into Armenianis one of the favorite linguistic-grammatical means [1, 58], it is known.
 MoreIt is interesting that these new formations, in some cases, are gaythe circumstance of being. when, for example, the objective meaning "begins" to express an active action in one case and a passive action in the other.
Like many of the above verbs, they belong to this groupto take a break (to divide from the middle, to divide.(Wis. 18:14), to lead (nb-to teach: no one to lead themPriesthood (PB, 15), not to be a leader. The spirit of truth
to lead you (John 16:13), to follow (nb- to continue, for example, in the dark,that is to follow them (Wisdom 17:20), not to stand after something. Who followed the apostolic canons (K. VM, 86), to advance (nb-prevent, Pride flourished in the height of his arrogance [4, 337], not to emerge, to be a leader. But let my lord prosper than his servants (Gen. 33, 14)
The verbs have also preserved the heterogeneity in the sources of the post-Cedar period, and the accumulate, mix, gnaw, announce verbs are heterosexual in modern Armenian (that is, they are heterosexual in Armenian.throughout the historical development) և mainly preserved the Grabar meanings.
Thus, in the works of the classical period of Grabar, they are not foundAbout 20 verbs with a verbal suffix, which are mostly double-sex in the sources of the post-classical period.
  Let's move on to the examination of the corresponding verbs of the post-classical period1.
The verbs included in this subgroup either do not occur at all in the classical period or are used grammatically with only one gender2 (original examples are also given from the middle period).
To make worthy-nb-worthy. Zamanesian deserves his rest (Ag. 14), and he did not deserve himself [4, 356],
to become unworthy. The Bdeshkhut side deserved to be taken
(MG, 71).
 Serve-nb-serve, serve. When he was a child, he used to serve my brothers [4, 737], not to be a servant. To serve with appetite

Let the light shine before you [4, 928] և etc.
This group includes rebellion, privatization, characterization,belt, grieve, rage, benevolent, mediate verbs.
As we know, the 5th is next to the suffixes specific to Old ArmenianThey have been used by Greek scholars since the second half of the 20th centuryAbout two dozen suffixes created bymake up a certain number of verbs with an initial basisna-bisexual verbs.
In this group there are double-sex verbs with up-, open-, change-, dance-, anti-suffixes, for example, brighten-nb-brighten. Cannabis beam is a shadowless light in a mentally illuminated world (MG,
246), do not shine. glorified in all virtue:
He often said that whatever the work of Christ (MG, 246), reciprocate, return, return. Let the earth be reciprocated by sending a heavenly blessing [4, 946], do not return. Served as:

they swarmed their nets (Luke 5: 6), the opposite sideto make… .reverse to him again [4, 5], not to be inverted.1 Post-classical, as we know, is called from 461 to the 8th centurythe fallen region.
2 We have stated above that such an assertion may seem abstract, but we are guided by the facts provided by the sources we have studied.
The first is not the opposite, and this is the opposite [4, 5][4, 5] և etc.
Thus, post-classical originals are based on heterosexualityAbout 20 verbs with non-verbal suffixes, 7 of which are Greekwith a primer created by suffixes 1.
They are included in the pre-middle period from the middle of the eighth centuryworks written in the eleventh century.
It should be noted that one of these verbs in classical Old Armenian sourceshow many are found, but grammatically with only one gender, and the secondGender (s) are found only in pre-Middle Ages.
The original examples, however, show that the problemMost of the subject verbs are found only in pre-medieval sources.
Let us first introduce the bisexual verbs based on the oldThey are suffixes specific to Armenian.
Those verbs are to win nb-win. Sell ​​it with many profits, profit your soul [4, 458], do not benefit, use. While eating and drinking
to take that the eater has nothing to gain [4, 458], to moderate nb-moderate - To measure ourselves, to measure ['[4, 574], not to be moderate, to be humble. Ziard's grave in moderation [4, 574], to rent. Very attractive, rented with silver… [4, 796], no rent
to receive Peter's residence to the martyr, և mercenary indeed [4,
796].
In the same group, they used to train, align, pair, make possible 2 bisexual verbs, etc.
1 It is clear that these verbs, unlike others, in the classical periodthey simply could not meet.
2 Dashnakt-nb- to make an ally, to ally. To fulfill the promise of unity, which he allied with the sea, to become a non-ally, to reconcile. Up to now

 Hairdressing, nailing, nailing, loading. Shave with a stick while chewing Sisara, not dense foliage
to become The fig tree was haired with foliage [4, 798] և etc.
Let us turn to the formations with suffixes created by Greek scholars.
  In this period they meet up, vice-, dance-,art-, har-, tar-, ham-, pre-, shahr-, infinitive verbs with initials, for example, re-call-nb-call out loud.They always resonated with their inner man, their supervisors [4,807], not to be heard, to speak loudly. In common, the dialect resonated at night [4, 807], puzzled, puzzled, hesitated.

was confused (Ag., 19).
In the same group, they also acquired, initiated, reborn, joined,to enclose, to underline the verbs և etc.
There are 16 double-sex verbs in the third subgroup, 9 of which are verb basesare composed of suffixes created by the Greek school.
Thus, the above examination proves that in Old Armenian (allin three sub-regions) are found in non-verbal suffixesAbout 50 double-sex verbs with the initial basis, forming the Old ArmenianAbout 10% of double verbs.
The suffix -avor stands out for its frequency of use (17 verbs), the initials of about 20 verbs have a different meaning in Old Armeniansuffixes, the initials of these 11 verbs contain the suffixes created by the Greek school1.
In general, after the classical period, there is an increase in the number of prepositional verbs with a prefix due toby increasing the total number of prefixes և the frequency of use.
The study shows that the recurrence of the verb is mainly conditioned by the semantic structure of the latter ևwith a non-initial composition, in which the word-formation suffixes are present,Having already formed the semantic structure of the noun, they usually have no special meaning for the verb.
1 In some cases, the verb base has two suffixes, such as mediate and ragein the case of verbs և etc.
Verbs with a consonant in the classical period of GrabarThis feature is usually retained in other subregions, which suggests that the formation of heterosexuality orNeutralization takes much longer.
