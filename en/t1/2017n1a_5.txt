Introduction.
 The Shirak mountain range extends within the northwestern segment of the Pambak-Shan-Syunik active fracture zone.
  The Pambak-San-Syunik-Akhuryan fractures intersect at the site of the mountain range, splitting the mountain chain into three main segments in the west-east direction: western, central-eastern [1].
 Due to its position in the tectonic plan, the area of ​​the Shirak mountain range is distinguished by its geodynamic-high seismic activity.
As part of the work, we tried to analyze the geological structure of the mountain range in order to separate its block structure.
  The essence of structural-geological analysis in this case is that the separation of the block structure is based exclusively on the geological analysis of the slopes of the mountain range.
Research methodology.
  Fracture tectonics is known to be one of the most active relief factors, which is constantly in contact with external geodynamic processes.
In the young mountainous regions, where the mountain-forming processes are still actively going on, the priority in the relief formation belongs to the endogenous geological processes.
  The mentioned refers to the Shirak mountain range, which is a typical fold-folding mountain unit formed in the latest stage.
 Its unique position has greatly influenced the formation of geological features of the development of the mountain range.
 The mountain range borders the Shirak intermountain graben-concave in the southern part, adjacent to the Akhuryan River gorge in the west, and borders the Pambak and Bazum mountain ranges from east to northeast, respectively. [2]
 From what has been said, it must be concluded that the southern and north-eastern slopes of the mountain range have been developed for millions of years in completely different geological conditions, which undoubtedly should have had an impact on the steepness of the slopes.
Based on the analysis of the morphology of the slopes of the Shirak mountain range (և in general), we have used this one precondition for the separation of its block structure, that is, the current tectonic processes of the geological past must have some expression in the modern ecology of the mountain slopes.
 In the case of the Shirak mountain range, this important precondition is conditioned by the climatic conditions of the place.
 As it is known from various ancient geographical researches, from the latest tectonic stage until now the climate change within the studied area has been tended towards gradual drying up.
  This leads to a decrease in the intensity of the slope processes, which is mainly manifested by deluvial washing of the slopes և demolition processes [3].
  The vivid evidence of this is the powerful proluvial-deluvial plumbing spread in the southern foothills of the Shirak mountain range.
This serves as a sufficient basis for substantiating the attempt to separate its block structure by a geological analysis of the Shirak mountain range.
The main results.
  The digital terrain models formed by recent satellite surveys for the study area, ASTER_GDEM, were used to conduct the survey.
  The digital model of the relief of the Shirak mountain range, visualized in the GIS environment (ArcGIS 10), is presented in Figure 1.
Figure 1. Digital model of the relief of the Shirak mountain range The logic of the performed researches is based on the fact that the obtained digital model of the obtained relief has been subjected to profiling, with the profiles crossing the mountain range in a transverse direction, passing exclusively through watersheds.
  As can be seen from Figure 1, a total of 11 structural geological sections were performed, the results of which are presented in Figure 2.
Since the detachment of the block structure of the mountain range is based on the morphological features of the slopes, the main and typical quantitative indicators of which are the slope slopes, the numerical model of the slope slopes of the Shirak mountain range was compiled on the basis of the relief model.
 The data of the morphological analysis of the slopes with these sections are presented in the tables below (Tables 1, 2).
Figure 2. Structural-longitudinal cross-sectional cuts of the slopes of the Shirak mountain range. on the southern or northern slopes of the mountains.
 At the same time, within the same section, on the north-south-south-slopes of the mountain range, the sequential expression of the blocks is not preserved everywhere.
 In particular, the first class block units, the upper hypsometric limit of which passes through absolute heights up to 1750 m, are expressed only on the southern slopes of the mountain range, ie in the zone of gradual transition to the Shirak intermountain depression.
 In addition, in some cases the boundaries of the blocks are not clearly expressed in the relief, as a result of which the II և III class blocks in particular sometimes appear as a single block unit, as can be seen from the sections 2-2, 3-3 և 6-6 in Table 1.
 As for the III 'block, as it seems from the cuts, it is not expressed everywhere.
 Block III is probably a separate part of the old leveling surface, which, as it is known, at the latest stage, being subjected to fractures, was raised to different heights.
Referring to the general patterns of slope values ​​that formed the basis for the separation of the blocks, it should be emphasized that, as can be seen from Tables 1 և 2 above, in the boundary areas of the blocks, which are geologically fragmentary formations, sloping slopes are observed. which often exceeds the values ​​of the average slopes of the slopes within the blocks.
Conclusion.
 Thus, summarizing the above, we conclude that the Shirak mountain range is a rather complex structure from a geological point of view, which is divided not only by well-known fractures that cross its territory in the meridian direction, but also by a number of east-east stretch fractures.
 The formation of the latter should be connected with the uplift of the mountain range at different stages of tectonic development.
  At the same time, it should be noted that the fault tectonics was more intense on the southern slopes of the mountain range, which was reflected in the mostly gradual morphology of the southern slopes.
  The relatively weak fault tectonics on the northern slopes of the mountain range is explained by the wetter climatic conditions than the southern ones, which is most important by completely different tectonic conditions, as the Shirak mountain range is bordered on the south by the Shirakigrabaz B-depression.
