Artashes Harutyunyan is one of the grateful people of Armenian-Armenian literature, whose literary and social life coincided with the years of the anti-Armenian policy of the Turkish dictatorship, when every attempt to express national and intellectual identity was drenched in blood.
During this period of social and political life, the powerful forces of Western Armenian culture were largely displaced.
 With his sobering predictions and impartial literary-publicist articles, Artashes Harutyunyan ruled over the Armenian-Armenian cultural thought, keeping the discouraged intellectual life alive.
In 1908-1910, Artashes Harutyunyan (1873-1915) published national-political issues in the periodicals "Azatamart", "Armenian Literature", "Voice of the Fatherland", "Byzantium".
The coup d'etat of the Young Turks and the July Constitution inspired romantic illusions in the Armenians.
  Many of the deported intellectuals set out on their way back.
 Only twenty days after the Constitution, Harutyunyan writes in the publicist article "The Good of Freedom". "My God, what a horrible dream to wake up to!"
 ... Would we live?
 It was a dumb, criminal martyrdom.
 We have to write, we have to write the history of this thirty-year martyrdom. "[2]
With an internal alarm Art. Harutyunyan predicted that the nationwide rallies and celebrations of 1908 would give rise to national mourning and destruction.
  The Cilicia events of 1909 confirmed the writer's concerns.
Bringing together the historical past of the Armenian people and the brutal present, he writes: "Without lyricism, without rhetorical frustration ... we should be able to state with unemotional seriousness that among the red wine glasses glorifying the episodes of human history, the Armenian blood is the only one that is most abundantly shaved, to satisfy the regular easy-going grandfathers of bloodshed."
  The public speaker lists certain facts. "Jinkiz Khan dyed his fleshy and netted beard with that blood, Lenktimur anointed the bile skin of his stinging beast with it. Bugha took baths with Armenian blood to quell the fury of the tiger and rabies. Abdul Hamid, the most bloodthirsty, the most gloomy deceiver of the present time, Korilla, endured the regular manic rages of his two-faced hybrid [7 pages].
The July Constitution of the Young Turks promised to put an end to all forms of struggle for survival: "Armenian blood should not run either", "miraculously, the open wound of six hundred years" should be spared.
 However, the expectations fade away, because "the Constitution," Harutyunyan writes, "was not a force, it was not a complete victory, but only a promise, a smile." [3]
 After all, in 95-96. The temporary cessation of the bloody massacres "with new vigor and barbarism" bled again, bled with unparalleled terrible bleeding, indefinitely the uncertain greens that sprouted to suffocate. "[3]
Artashes Harutyunyan demands from the Turkish government to put an end to all "political, diplomatic or barbaric" decisions, which "while serving to satisfy the same unique and brutal instincts of mortals", especially fall on the heads of the Armenians.
  The publicist disguises the propaganda of the "morality" of the Turkish government, reveals the extreme backwardness of the Turkish political, economic and cultural development.
 The writer's indignation turns into an outburst of protest. "Why does the mob break us?" He asks and adds: "obsolete, timeless ... it is a contradiction of morality ..." [4, page 1].
After relentlessly criticizing the policy pursued by the "Jeon Turks", after three years of experience, A. Harutyunyan comes to the conclusion that "... except for a certain amount of extravagance, a relatively deceptive freedom", the constitution did not bring any news.
  The search for the causes of reality leads to the conclusion that the Turkish state has no edge in joining the progressive countries.
  According to Art. According to Harutyunyan, the constitution was called not only to create a good situation for the peoples under the rule of Turkish rule, but also to break the shackles of the Turks' backwardness.
The publicist gave a precise explanation to the hateful behavior of the Turkish nation. it stems from the feelings of national egoism rooted in the violent, savage classes.
The policy of the Turkish government aimed at the annihilation of the national identity of the peoples intensified every outbreak of the national liberation struggle.
 The practical policy of the Ottoman government - national oppression, forced deportation, conversion, massacres in between - was aimed at the extermination of Armenians, Arabs, Greeks, Bulgarians, Serbs, Kurds.
 Art. Harutyunyan disguises the policy of the Turkish military-feudal bureaucracy, writes: "Justice not for the Armenians, not for the Turks, not for the Kurds, not for the Greeks, not for the Turks, not for the Arabs, not for the Arabs, but for any feeling, for any land, for any account, without discrimination and absolute Justice for Justice ”[5, p. 248].
As we notice, Harutyunyan stands for the happiness and well-being of humanity.
And where is civilized Europe, the ombudsman, the propagandist of humanity?
  The publicist criticizes the indifference of the European states, addresses the question to the peoples of the world. Is the issue of rescuing an Armenian doomed to extinction from the bloody clutches of the barbarian tribe from the bloody clutches of the barbarian tribe a nobility "who entered the grave with Tonkishot"?
  "Prosperous and deceitful official Europe,... We felt that the tears of his sometimes weeping prostitute, shed on the Armenian-insulted dignity, add to his grief, with the flowery poison of hypocrisy." [3]
The writer mercilessly criticizes, in Varuzhan's words, the "prostitute diplomacy of European states" and wonders how Europe tarnishes its name of progress.
But like our other writers on liberation ideology, he is convinced that the interests of civilized Europe do not coincide with those of the "Armenians", that "European diplomacy is indifferent to the bloody scene of our martyrdom."
  The Adana disaster forces Harutyunyan to analyze the results of the coup d'etat carried out by the Young Turks.
In 1910 in the pages of "Voice of the Fatherland" in the article "Beneficial pages of Russian revolutionary history", Art. Harutyunyan refers to the internal changes in the political life of tsarist Russia.
  He reminds the Armenians of Armenia of certain episodes of the revolutionary situation in Russia in 1879-1880, of Tsar Alexander II, Minister of Internal Affairs Count Sipyakin, Pobedanots, "Russian dictator Von Plehvey", the murderer of the Caucasus, Prince Bob Golikov.
As we can see, the publicist who deals with political issues becomes one of the unique thinkers in Western Armenia who defended the idea of ​​revolutionary struggle during the social and political revolutions.
  In the spirit of an honest patriot, Art. Harutyunyan took part in the national liberation battles waged by General Andranik's volunteer detachment.
Due to the strategy developed by Andranik Zoravar, the Turkish army was inflicted great damage with incomparably small forces, and Commander Yaver Pasha was captured and sent to Sofia, the tsar of the Bulgarians, on a disgraceful horse [6, p. 75].
The Turks took revenge on Artashes Harutyunyan, who during the Balkan Orphan War "took part in the activities aimed at asking the victorious states to allow Malkara to enter the Pulkar border".
The recapture of the city by them takes place so fast that the Harutyunyan family does not have time to cross to Bulgaria.
 The barbaric Turkish revenge creates a nightmare situation in the city.
"Armed Armenian men were passing from house to house within the Armenian district, vigilantly watching so that the Turks would not retreat."
 And the Turks tried that.
 Before handing over Malkaran to the Bulgarians, they wanted to massacre the Armenians, but the Armenians were preparing ... School director H. Oshakan, the poet Artashes Harutyunyan, his brother, the writer Vahan, and even their father, Haji Arti Agha, were armed and decided to resist, being sure that the Bulgarian army was at the gates of Malkara… "[7].
The deportations and massacres of Armenians had started in the provinces.
"The team of the Armenian intelligentsia was marching to Golgotha" [8].
The Turkish secular movement filled the page of the historical biography of the Armenian people with a new "red wine book" (Art. Harutyunyan).
  The great priests of art fell with axes.
  Hundreds of Armenians were arrested.
  The Armenian world is turning into a vast slaughterhouse.
The crime continues day and night.
In order to save his imprisoned son, Harutyunyan's father is bought in Constantinople.
 Ali Riza from Malkar, who became the horror of the Armenians, was the grandson of a dictator called Hussein Effendi.
  Recognizing Artinagha, Ali Riza immediately arrested him.
 By the order of the former director of the prisons of Constantinople Ibrahim չ, the brutal tortures are resumed.
  Hakob Sargsyan testifies that the writer bravely endures the horrible torments. "Artashes had seen the cry of his old father, but he had not even uttered a word of supplication to the executioners." [9]
 They say that in the days of relatively good feeling Art. Harutyunyan spoke enthusiastically about literature.
The moral description of the writer is presented from the memories of contemporaries. "In the most bitter state of suffering, in the moments of suffering, he looked out of the window of the room we found at the women and boys in the outside yard, and his forgotten pains were filled with their pains," writes A. Mubaheachyan.
- How many times did he ask me? "What will happen to them when their husbands are exiled?"
 These women and children will starve to death. ”[10]
  At night, under the control of three armed Turkish guards, the two defenseless Armenians were taken away, who, to be fair, could not expect anything but death.
"Against death, no matter how you close your eyes, O my best man, I am convinced, the joy of Arya opened in the midst of your pure blood like gold, and a ribbon of your much-loved Motherlink soul descended on you."
 "Contrary to the fact that the crime was the one that kept you awake, your youth became a smile, a Metterlink smile," [11] wrote Hakob Oshakan.
Artashes Harutyunyan did not have the fortune to live a God-given life normally, he became one of the victims of the untold genocide of 1915, sharing the fate of countless Armenians who were martyred in the Turkish massacre.
Art. In the valuable literary pages left by Harutyunyan, the progressive position of the theoretician-analyst and active citizenship with a wide point of view of the perception and evaluation of the social-political situation of the time are presented today.
 He did not dwell on the prospects of national autonomy promised by the Young Turks, disguised the anti-popular practices of the Ottoman Empire, the young Turks, and the diplomatic manipulations of the imperialist states, presenting the active citizenship of his artistic progressive position.
