Real crystals differ from the ideal in that they contain many irregularities in the regular arrangement of the atomic crystal lattice of the solid.
 These network defects are related to both the technical conditions of crystal growth and further technological processes.
  However, structural defects in the crystal can also occur during external influences on it - heating, plastic deformation, implantation, electric-magnetic fields.
It has been proven [1,2] that ions penetrating the crystal lattice at a very high speed (energy) "damage" the lattice, causing lattice defects.
It is known [3,4] that the X-ray diffraction method is a rather delicate, accurate method for the study of structural defects in almost perfect crystals, structural defects in perfect crystals subjected to various external influences.
  Thus, in work [5], X-ray interferometry has been experimentally shown that the gradual increase in the radiation flux during ion implantation leads to the accumulation of primary point defects, particularly dislocations.
  In paper [6], the transverse deformations of the surface layer of an ion-implanted silicon crystal (interferometer block) were experimentally investigated using a double X-ray interferometer.
  Based on the results of the experiment, the relative deformations որոշ integral stresses will be determined depending on the radiation dose.
  In [7], X-ray interferometric research methodology was developed for the study of the nanostructure of ion implanted surface layers of silicon crystals, and the relationships of the "swelling" of these layers were obtained.
  In Work [8], the X-ray three-block interferometer with a special structure was used to determine the conditions for the expression used to calculate the periodicity of moire images when estimating the deformation fields caused by ion implantation in a crystal (interferometer block).
 In Work [9], an X-ray three-block interferometer first shows that the temperature gradient applied to a crystal plate (interferometer block) can cause dilatation of the crystal lattice (change in intermediate distances), then a temperature is established.
  The effect of an electric field on the structure of polar crystals, in particular piezoelectrics և segnetoelectrics, is studied in Paper [10].
 The work 11 investigated the structural irregularities in silicon semiconductor crystals under the influence of an external constant magnetic field by X-ray interferometric method.
In experiments, the authors obtained X-ray maps for different values ​​of the magnetic field induction vector modulus. They showed that the effect of the magnetic field on the interferometer block led to a change in the moiety of the molar layers, and then to calculate the relative deformation at 1500 with the help of experimental data. In case of value, the image of Moore disappears.
  Based on the above, X-ray interferometric examination of structural defects caused by various external influences in crystals in general, and the study of transverse deformations caused by external fixed magnetic fields in particular, is one of the current problems in solid state physics, to which this work is dedicated.
Because the X-ray interferometric method is extremely sensitive to structural disturbances և has a high solubility, in this work we have also applied this method to the study of structural defects caused by the influence of external magnetic fields in the silicon crystal.
The paper presents the results of theoretical research on the effects of fixed magnetic fields on silicon semiconductor crystals by X-ray diffraction method, where a new X-ray interferometer proposed by us was used for the theoretical description of the deformation fields of crystals.
 The goal is achieved with the help of double (one interferometer can work as two interferometers with reflections, respectively) interferometers (Fig. 1), as the study of structural defects in semiconductor crystals with such interferometers will provide a more complete picture of the deformation fields in the crystal.
 For this purpose, the theoretical results of deformation field studies in crystals in the case of double interferometer (Fig. 1) are presented in the work.
 քումThe work explains the mechanisms of change of interfacial distance (dilatation) ում in the block-crystal of the X-ray interferometer և under the influence of an external constant magnetic field և the mechanisms of movement of the dislocations, therefore և the reasons for the change of Moar's image. n temperature
(where:

 For the first time, the change in magnetic permeability of the magnetic field in the directions perpendicular to it was taken into account.
A connection has been made between the latter, the vector modulus of the magnetic field induction, the "integral stress components of the relative deformations of the crystal deformation field" and the Moirer's period.
[12] It is known that during implantation an elongated state occurs in the crystal, which can be studied in the same way as in the case of thermal expansion, that is, there is a similarity with thermal expansion լար voltages arising during implantation at 022220 BB, where

  A similar analogy was proposed by Prussin [13] when he studied the stresses in a crystal by diffusion ligation.
  He made such a resemblance at the time

  With such an approach we [6] have obtained the following expressions for the components of relative deformations և transverse stresses: Fig.1. The crystallographic directions և the ray trajectory in a double triple block interferometer են are the components of the Yuyg module, and are explained by the special structure of the interferometer.

The periods of the molar layers are respectively during the reflexes, then we get from (6) to (7):
  Since the interferometer is a double և, for both cases we will have ևreverse (8) և (9), respectively, from where (14).
As shown in (14), the periodicity of the dilatation morator is inversely proportional to the vector modulus of magnetic field induction.
Results analysis. To confirm the validity of the above theoretical judgments, let us first present a physical explanation of the mechanism of action of a magnetic field on a crystal.
  Thus, based on the results of our experiments, it follows that there are structural irregularities in one of the blocks of the interferometer (Fig. 2a), as the image of the moat is a set of isopular lines է is conditioned by those irregularities.
 If a new defect (eg dislocation) occurs in one of the blocks of the interferometer, the field of mechanical stresses generated around the interferometer will cause the redistribution of the phases to be returned at the inlet of the analyzer (block 3) and consequently a change in Moore's image.

  For example, in almost perfect crystals (the interferometer is made of just such a crystal) the magnitude of the elastic limit is part of the slip module, so the external magnetic fields we use on the interferometer (B = 0,075 Tl-0,225 Tl) are sufficient to affect the distance of atomic planes. (dilation).
  Moreover, it has been confirmed 17 that the state of the dislocation system changes under the influence of the external magnetic field. Dislocations move along the plane of the slide.
 Such small displacements cause additional relative deformation, which leads to a change in Moore's image (Fig. 2b).

  Thus, assuming that the induction vector of the magnetic field is perpendicular to the reflecting planes (experiments are performed for this case), the axis is parallel to the crystallographic direction, and - to (, see Fig. 1), then according to [18]
 (for silicon).
On the other hand, if the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of reflection, then, and if the field is perpendicular to, then.
Using the above facts, let's evaluate the parameter reference
in the case of dimensions.
  Given that և taking a specific value of B (say, for example) and a value derived from experience for relative deformation (say, for example,
), We will count from (12) (in case of the above data we get:
 ).
Having, we can use (12) to calculate the corresponding component of the relative deformation:
For any specific value of the induction vector module.
 Thus, for example, if we insert (12) into the induction vector modulus, we take the value given above for (
, then we will get for relative deformation.
 In a similar way, the parameter և can theoretically be calculated for the corresponding value of induction B (in this case, the images must be used).
 Interference from the planes in the conclusion. The results of the evaluation show that the theoretical-experimental results obtained for the relative deformation match quite well, which is a guarantee for the experimental studies of the presented theoretical calculations.
 By the way, the experimental researches of the problem are going on, և the results will be published after the end.
