Impartial coverage of current political, educational and cultural issues stems from the imperative of close Armenian-Georgian cooperation and restoration of friendship.
The present study aims to resolve the "Armenian-Georgian conflict" with ethnocentric purposeful models, to prevent the deepening crisis, the assimilation of the Armenians of Javakhk and mass emigration.
  The various approaches to the issue mislead the international community and lead to the uncoordinated behavior of stakeholders.
Georgian historians claim that Gugark has always been part of the Kingdom of Kartli, based on the changes made in the infamous treaty of 387 [7, 69].
It is indisputable that A. The testimony of Shirakatsi, although Gugarknq is still part of Virk, is taken from Armenia [12, 297].
  Javakhk was one of the 9 provinces of Gugark province of Greater Armenia, and Gugark first joined Virk in 387 [7, 67].
In 1830 the Armenians of Erzurum and its environs emigrated en masse to Javakhk.
In the 1920s, the call for Javakhk (part of it) to reunite Armenia as an ethno-territorial unit or to create one Armenian administrative unit within the Georgian USSR (Al. Bekzadyan, Al. Myasnikyan) was rejected by Georgian state circles [7, 18 և 21].
According to the Georgian historian Leonti Mroveli, before that he had not been to Javakhk, St. Nino in AD In the 3rd century, he spoke Armenian with the shepherds in Foga, on the shores of Lake Parvana.
  Therefore, the fact of temporary denial of ownership of the country cannot serve as a basis for being considered "property".
Samtskhe-Javakheti occupies about 10% of the territory of Georgia, where more than half of the Armenians of Georgia live, and in Javakhk alone, which occupies 3.7% of Georgia, 94-95% of the population are Armenians [10.14, 14], it now makes 125 thousand Armenians (according to unofficial data - 145 thousand).
  Javakhk is not a Diaspora, the Armenians of Javakhk are subetnos, who live in their cradle, on a historical territory, so it becomes necessary due to the compulsion of national security 1 The Armenians of Javakhk are the Armenians living in Javakhk.
 The Georgian-Armenians ("Georgian-Armenians") are the Armenians living all over Georgia.
 The term "Georgian" is not a surname here.
to raise the issue of granting the status of autonomy within the administrative-territorial structure of Georgia.
  Otherwise, the Armenians of Javakhk will lose their ethnic identity in the near future, will integrate into Georgian culture under the pretext of creating a civil society.
  This process corresponds to the general logic of global tendencies, as self-isolation is impossible by creating a self-sufficient system.
  All ethnic components are gradually merged into a single civic association, replacing ethnic identity with civic identity.
However, the establishment of an ethnic community in Georgia is difficult to achieve, especially among ethnic "minorities" of Azerbaijanis "Armenians", as their group political orientations and cultural requirements are different.
  In addition, the deliberate discrimination against the Armenians of Javakhk by the open, non-latent form of the radical ethnos cannot contribute to the formation of a national consciousness.
 Ernest Gellner rightly mentioned. "The satisfaction of some nations is marked by the disappointment of others" [2: 10-11].
The Georgian side must take into account the historical ruthlessness, restrain the unfounded baseless ambitions towards the ancient Armenian territories.
  Gone are the days when it was possible to Georgianize everything that is Armenian by spreading the language and changing the place names.
  According to unofficial data, there are 460 thousand Armenians in Georgia, and according to official sources, about 250 thousand, including 150 thousand in Tbilisi [13, 348].
In Georgia until 2002 The Armenians took the second place (437.2 thousand), and the Russians (341.2 thousand) took the third place [14, 13].
  The rapid increase in the birth rate of Azerbaijanis has allowed the ethnic group to occupy the first place (6.5%) among the national minorities, and the Armenians - the second (5.7%) [14, 13].
 2002 According to the data, up to 284.8 thousand Azeris live in Georgia, but the latter are convinced that they are half a million, even more [9, 18].
Azeris live collectively in Kvemo-Kartli, mainly in Marneuli, Gardabani, Bolnisi and Dmanisi districts.
 2002 According to the census, the population of that state was 497,530 people, of which 45.1% were Azeris, 44.7% were Georgians, and 6.4% were Armenians [6, 7].
  There are announcements about the creation of a special Movement, the aim of which is to separate KvemoKartli from Georgia, and as a beginning of that process, the issue of giving the status of an Azerbaijani regional language will be raised.
If in Georgia Armenians are considered a national minority, then in homosexual Javakhk they are a national majority.
  OSCE High Commissioner Max van Der Stulibnorogh was quoted as saying. "… A minority is a group characterized by linguistic, ethnic or cultural features that distinguish it from the majority.
  Second, the minority is a group that usually seeks not only to preserve its originality, but also to express it vividly ”[3, 165].
As a result of ethnic discrimination, Javakhk is emptied of Armenians, the migration of a local radical nation becomes a national security issue.
  Moreover, the Turkish-Azerbaijani element is being resettled. The issue of resettlement was one of the preconditions for Georgia's membership in the Council of Europe.
  The resettlement of 400,000 Turkmen Meskhetians in the region is an intention to change the demographic situation of the Georgian authorities, which threatens interethnic-inter-religious relations.
At the beginning of the 20th century, multinational Georgia instinctively began to work out a plan to create a mono-ethnic nation-state, which expresses nationalism, to turn the multinational state into a mono-ethnic one by violating the rights of ethnic minorities, and otherwise to assimilate the nation-state.
In international practice, a country is considered mono-ethnic, where 95% of the population is made up of one ethnic group (Iceland, Norway, Portugal, Albania, Malta, Jamaica, Yemen, Hungary).
 [17, 54] G.T. Tavadov considers that the nation-state is a state of ethnos (nation) formed on the basis of ethnic territory; it embodies the political independence and autonomy of the peoples.
 [16, 275] In societies with a monoethnic structure, more favorable conditions are created for democratization than in the case of ethnic heterogeneity.
  Ethnic conflicts in Georgia have led to the establishment of an authoritarian ethnocentrism, which makes so-called multi-ethnic democracy impossible, insofar as it is based on inter-group conflict.
  Even international organizations, such as the US State Department and the Council of Europe Anti-Crisis Group, testify to that.
  The educational and cultural sphere in Javakhk is endangered, Armenian schools are closing rapidly, Armenian language classes are reduced, Georgian language is increased, the subject of "Armenian history" is banned, toponyms are changed.
  In 2005, Georgia adopted the Law on Public Education, which (Article 4.3) states that "Georgian citizens whose mother tongue is not Georgian have the right to receive a general education in their mother tongue", but the ground is being prepared for the transition to a pan-Georgian education system. partly practically happened.
 In the area inhabited by more than 90% Armenians, the state language is imposed, the process of Georgianization of Armenians is accelerated [11, 60.8, 142].
Georgian language testing of candidates for the positions of teachers and principals of secondary schools is being held in the country.
 It is argued that without knowledge of Georgian it is impossible to integrate into the Georgian state.
 Armenians do not neglect the state language, Georgian, as all official documents are in Georgian.
In world cartography, "Georgia" is marked as a country only in the 15th century.
  Before that, the countries of Colchis, Iberia and Mengrelia were mentioned in the region of Georgia [1, 12].
  Armenians participated equally with other peoples in the establishment and prosperity of the Georgian state.
 Mesrop Mashtots, the founder of the 5th century Armenian cultural culture, created the alphabet for the unfortunate Georgians.
  Armenians voted for Georgia's independence on the basis of a constitution guaranteeing the rights of national minorities.
1995 The Convention on the Protection of National Minorities (Agreement) was adopted in Strasbourg, according to which the ethnic population living in a group in its historical territory has the right to at least linguistic and cultural independence, added cultural connection with its mother country, although it is not a viable model of self-organization.
International experience has shown that in countries where national minorities make up 20%, they have the right to consider their mother tongue as a second regional language.
 In 20-30 countries around the world, the languages ​​of 20% of the national minorities living collectively have the status of regional languages.
 There are articles in the Spanish and Italian constitutions that guarantee state support for the preservation and development of the languages ​​of national minorities.
  In Finland, the language of the Swedish minority (about 6%) is declared the state language [17, 50].
 This is an exceptional phenomenon, which is explained by historical motives, because in Finland at one time Swedish was considered an educational and cultural language.
Providing general education on the basis of the mother tongue is the guarantee not only of deepening the preservation of the general identity of the national minority, but also of the internal political stability of the country, the democratic solution of the language problem.
School graduates are given vouchers to continue their studies in Yerevan, but the certificate is reserved only for students in Georgia.
 The state does not subsidize those schools where the number of students is less than 700-800.
In Javakhk, school communities are not only barred from participating in church services in memory of the victims of the Armenian Genocide, but the Georgian authorities have not yet recognized the Armenian Genocide for fear of worsening relations with Turkey.
After a long struggle, the Armenian Apostolic Church recently received 5 religious statuses in Georgia under the Civil Code.
 [5] The Armenian Apostolic Churches and Armenian buildings are not owned by the Armenian ethnos, they are under Georgian law under the auspices of the Georgian Orthodox Church and the Georgian state.
During the years of independence in Georgia, there were almost no Armenians among the oligarchs.
 Now the field of capital investments in the country has become quite favorable for Armenian investors as well.
  Thus, in 2010 According to official data, 103 Armenian companies were re-registered in Georgia, and the Union of Armenian Businessmen was recently established [7,341].
There are sprouts of cooperation with the caretaker structure of the Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church in Georgia.
The process of democracy in Georgia is hindered by the almost absence of Georgian-Armenians in the governance of the country.
  The Georgian elite (elite) pushes the national minorities out of the system of governing the country with its nationalist policy, creates a disproportion in the ruling elite.
 Now, according to unofficial data, the number of Armenians in the state system does not exceed 1-2%.
 This approach is explained by the alleged state language skills of Armenians.
  Moreover, the Armenian specialist is paid relatively little in Georgia.
Up to 67 Armenian NGOs are officially registered in Georgia, although in reality some of them are active.
  They perform a national preservation function, mainly at the expense of local means.
Georgia is integrating into the European Union and NATO.
  Georgia not only lost South Ossetia "Abkhazia" as a result of the conflict with the Russian Federation, but was doomed to a long-term conflict zone, which poses a serious threat to Tbilisi 's energy policy.
Georgia does not enter into diplomatic relations with the powers that recognize the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
Turkey's short-sighted strategic relations with Azerbaijan and Azerbaijan, a number of regional programs to be implemented with its active participation և The blockade of the Republic of Armenia is not in our interests.
The Armenian authorities are pursuing a balanced policy, as we are dependent on transit traffic from the neighboring country.
The traditional self-defense mechanisms of the Armenians of Javakhk do not have deep roots in comparison with the communities of the Diaspora, because living in their own territory, next to the mother country, does not worry about the danger of assimilation.
Nevertheless, the demand for the national self-determination of the Armenians of Javakhk (through a non-separatist program) is the result of the hard work of the Georgian people: economic exploitation, political pressure, national persecution, disenfranchisement, direct integration of the nation.
In order to carry out a planned mission, the Office of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities has been operating in Georgia since 1997 [3,115], which mainly deals with resolving issues related to the Armenians of the Samtskhe-Javakheti region and preventing tensions in that region.
Theories and methodological approaches to multicultural education have been developing rapidly in the West since the 1980s.
In countries where the demographic composition is multiethnic, different educational models are offered.
Instead of the American "boiler" strategy, the modern concept of "American salad" was introduced, in other words, a multilingual or bilingual (bilingual) education system was introduced, which is considered a model for overcoming interethnic conflicts.
Bilingual content education in multiethnic societies allows to integrate into that society, preserving the national identity.
The foreign experience of bilingual education has 4 models, which refer to the age limit for the use of a foreign language.
1. Radical (extremist) model. assumes the organization of education for students from the first grade in a non-native language.
2. Transitional language model. assumes gradual preparation of students for learning in a non-native language by increasing the number of subjects taught.
3. Advanced language learning model. assumes teaching all or a number of subjects in two mother tongues at the same time.
4. Linguistic survival model, according to which all subjects are taught in the mother tongue, and the foreign language is reserved for support.
The first two models are unacceptable, as they lead to the loss of national identity.
 The last two models can be applied experimentally in some Diaspora communities where national education is endangered.
  It is expedient to use the content type of bilingual education, the organization of the educational process in two languages.
Ethnic minorities can be classified into the following groups according to their goals.1. The pluralist group seeks to preserve its ethnic identity, but actively participates in the activities of social institutions of the society.
2. The assimilated (assimilated) group does not care about the preservation of its ethnic identity.
3. The intolerant-fighting group strives for its own ethnic identity և seeks complete political independence.
4. A group participating in civil-social integration, which seeks at least cultural independence or autonomy within the administrative structure of a given state.
National cultural independence allows the Armenians of Javakhk to use their cultural values, religious propaganda, develop their language in public and official spheres, study Armenian history, create national unions, deepen cultural and scientific ties with Armenian communities and the motherland.
  A similar solution does not diminish the rights of other ethnic minorities.
The Armenian factor worries the Georgian society more and creates anti-Armenian moods.
Nevertheless, a new political cycle is beginning in the Armenian-Georgian relations in Georgia.
  Russian federal capital flows to Georgia, which pursues a political goal - to strengthen control over that country.
  That consensus is beneficial for the Republic of Armenia.
  The Georgian authorities have begun to ignore the complication of Armenia's relations with Azerbaijan, and see the neighboring country, the Republic of Armenia, as a supporter of the restoration and development of Russian-Georgian relations.
The process of integration of minorities in a multiethnic society will proceed normally, without tension, if it is accompanied by the preservation of their cultural, linguistic and religious features, recognition of the diversity of the value system, ensuring active participation in public life, formation of an integrated multinational elite.
The ethno-political situation of the Armenians of Javakhk requires the development of such a multicultural educational theoretical model, which, relying on the international experience with great potential for national preservation, will allow to achieve at least cultural autonomy.
