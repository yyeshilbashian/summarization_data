In depth in school mathis being studiedTopic "Square equations".
  Dependsfrom the sign of the discriminator, the existence of real roots andQuantity issues.
 But often in different petitionsWe encounter problems in which it is necessary to study the arrangement of real roots of a quadratic equation on a numerical axis.
 It is usually recommended to students in such casesis considered to correspond to the square energy in questionfunction և discuss all possible parabolas of the latter graphpositions.
 We offer a different approach.
The paper attempts to isolate some possible variants of the arrangement of real roots of a square on a numerical axis նշել to mark it as necessary and sufficient in the form of theoremsthe conditions under which the real roots of the quadratic equation will have the specified arrangement on the numerical axis.
