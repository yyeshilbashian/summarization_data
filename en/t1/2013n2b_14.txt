The topic of "Square Equations" is studied in depth in the school mathematics course.
  Depending on the sign of the discriminator, issues related to the existence of real roots are discussed.
 However, in various petitions we often encounter problems in which it is necessary to study the arrangement of real roots of a square equation on a numerical axis.
 Usually, in such cases, students are asked to consider the function corresponding to the quadratic energy in question և to discuss all possible positions of the graph of the latter, the parabola.
 We offer a different approach.
The paper attempts to single out some possible variants of the arrangement of real roots of a quadratic equation on a numerical axis.
The paper discusses some non-typical problems encountered in the school mathematics course, during the solution of which the formulated theorems were used.
Suppose the equation of a square with real coefficients is given (whose discriminant roots are real, then the following arrangements are possible for the "real number" of those roots on the numerical axis: the real number is not the root of the equation.
  If is) ունեն have the equation.
Let us first discuss these cases for value, after which we will discuss them for any arbitrary real value.
Theorem 1.
  In order for the equation to have real roots դthese roots must be: a) positive, necessary և sufficient for the following conditions to occur: b) negative, necessary և sufficient for the following conditions to occur: c) different sign, necessary և sufficient for the following conditions to occur: condition.
Proof.
 It is clear that if the equation has positive roots, then և, moreover, according to Viet's theorem, then the necessity of the conditions mentioned in point "a" is proved.
  Now let's talk about satisfaction.
  The equation has the condition that from the condition, given the real roots of Vietierc, the theorem will follow that those real roots are of the same sign, and from the condition, again, considering the Viet theorem, will follow that the real roots of the same sign are positive.
 Point "a" is proven.
If the equation has negative roots, then և, moreover, according to Viet's theorem, then in point "b" the sign  0 02acbxaxxf1Dm1121xxm21xxmmxx 2121xmx0mm10; 0; 0acabD0; 0; 0acabD0ac121; xx0D0; 0 0; 02121acabacxxabxx0 The necessity of the conditions D10ac0ab121; xx0D0; 0 0; 02121acabacxxabxx has been proven.
 Now let's talk about satisfaction.
  the equation has a condition, given the condition, given Viet's two real roots,
Therefore, it follows that these real roots are of the same sign, and from the condition, again referring to Viet's theorem, it follows that the real roots of that same sign are negative.
 Point "b" is proven.
If the equation has roots of different signs, then, according to Viet's theorem, the necessity of the condition marked "c" is proved.
  Now let's talk about satisfaction.
The equation bar has the condition that it has real roots.
 On the other hand, according to Viet's theorem, the real roots of the equation are of different sign.
  Point "c" is proven.
  Theorem proved.
Let us now consider the arbitrary real value of Cases I-III.
Theorem 2.
  In order for the equation to have real roots ևthese roots must be given) large, is it necessary for the following conditions to occur from the real number, or is it the same: b) small, is it sufficient for the following conditions to occur, or that is the same.
 Proof.
Consider the energy of a square.
  Note that quadratic equations have the same discriminant և, besides, if the real quadratic equation և ը is the roots, the real roots of the quadratic equation.
  So we can argue that a real equation greater than a real number will have a given-will-be արմ square root այն only if the equation has positive roots, and for that, according to 0 D10ac0ab121; xx0 021 acacxx0ac042acbD121; xx021acxx121; xxm1m0; 0; 0mfamfaD0; 2; 0 FmfamabD0; 0; 0mfamfaD0; 2; 0mfamabDxbamaxmxfxg22 cbmam20xf0xg1x2x0xfmxx11mxx220xg1m0xg theorem 1 is necessary that the following conditions occur:
In the same way, the equation will have square roots less than the given real number only if the equation has negative roots, and for that, according to Theorem 1, it is necessary for the following conditions to occur:
.
 The theorem is proved.
Theorem 3.
  In order for the equation to have real roots ից from a real number and the other to be small, one of those roots must be given և enough for the condition to occur; Proof.
    It is clear that if the equation has realities such that then և, in addition,
Therefore, the necessity of the theorem is proved.
  Let us now turn to satisfaction.
