In this article, the typological features of the German language of the future are studied, which, if necessary, are presented in combination with the Armenian language.
Recently, these tense forms have been the subject of numerous discussions in the grammar literature.
 The differences that exist around Aparni are conditioned by the dual nature of Aparni, temporal և weather.
 Moreover, in one case the temporal perception of the aparna is denied, using only the weather nature, in the other case the weather nature is denied, prioritizing the temporal meaning of the aparna.
 In addition, the first և second's's eggs, located in the same's sphere in German, indicate belonging to different time plans.
 Based on Yu. Gabrielyan's German temporal horses classification: For tomorrow's horses we present the following picture of the classification. The first april acts as an absolute temporal plane according to the following position, while the second april belongs to the relative temporal plane according to the preceding position (2: 59-61).
Therefore, the aim of this article is to examine more comprehensively the principles of placement of herding horses in German, their typological features, to show the temporal and temporal nature of these eggs, to discover the possibilities of their sale.
  The presented topic is more relevant և from the point of view of linguistic studies, it is of greater interest in the sense that the linguistic facts we study in German are examined by combining the linguistic facts of Armenian, which allows discovering a number of similarities and differences between the combined languages. One of the key issues from the point of view of linguistic studies.
  The time of tomorrow is the main causal time of the transmission of the meaning of the day in German and Armenian, which in every neutral context or out of context expresses the meaning of the action, the event expressed after the moment of the word.
 However, unlike the present-past tense forms in the semantic field, this action expressed by these forms is never achievable or visible, it can be perceived as a pure intention, intended, expected reality or event.
  In German, as in Armenian, the eggs placed on the edge of the rock indicate temporal-weather meanings in the content plan.
  The day after tomorrow is definitely considered, for example, So werde ich um den Tageslohn arbeiten. Meanwhile, in the next example, the action expressed in the past tense is definitely weather. Peter will be the longest in Cologne. This fact, however, is interpreted differently in grammar.
 Գ. Hellbig և Y. Busha for the German verb accept two variants of aparni. in one case it is the meaning of the present action, in the other it is the action of the future (5, 137).
 In addition to such differentiated functions for Aparni, it is necessary to give a definition of common significance, which would include both components simultaneously: temporal և weather.
  In fact, there are two possible ways to describe tomorrow.
 One of the meanings of time or weather can be considered primary.
  Accordingly, in sentences such as Das wird derPostbote sein. Weather should be considered as a derivative of the main temporal function, which contributes to the expression of the nature of the forecast in the slopes, that is, it implies that "I say in advance that it is a postal messenger."
  Thus, the validity of this expression will be clear only after the moment of the speech, with the use of a shepherd's horse only in a timely manner.
But it is also possible to take the opposite approach to the fact that in the definition of aparni the weather element is realized first in the indicative attitude of aparn in expressions such as, for example, Sobald er das hört, wirder vor Wut platzen. In this case, a prediction is expressed in German by the equinox, which is presented as an assumption.
 Relying on the issue of post-characterization, Yu. Based on the results of Gabrielyan's typological study, we accept the definition of the "presuppositional" first day after tomorrow, in which case a double transfer takes place. In the first case, from the border sphere to the "presuppositional" or hypothetical sense sphere, such as Er wird zu Hause sein, he must be at home.
    In the second case, the sphere of time transfers, when the given horse of the first day can be presented with ambiguous components. presumption նում coincide at the moment of speaking (2,59-61).
  Such an application of aparni can be substantiated by the aparni temporal elements present in each assumption, as the validity of that assumption is established only at some point in aparan's time.
 Therefore, in the definition of aparine, we consider it necessary to distinguish two separate meanings in German for equine eggs in different spheres of their application, as only in parallel with their realization is the nature and internal structure of the given temporal horse conditioned.
  In German, the choice of the past participle as an action tense can be said not to depend on the fact that the past participle is placed in the past tense of the action, but on the speaker's attitude towards the expression.
 It is used not only because the action takes place after the moment of the speech, but also because the speaker is waiting for the future action, assumes or predicts the performance of the given action, as opposed to the present-moderating verbs with which it occurs in the semantic field.
 Tomorrow's horses are preferable in this field when the prediction, assumption, expectation of tomorrow's action comes from the present.
 Moreover, there are two separate semantic components in the general definition of these sounds: the exclusion of action from the moment of speaking and its appearance after the moment of speaking.
 From the point of view of function, however, tomorrow's horses are endowed with a number of typological peculiarities, which in many cases do not find a corresponding reflection in Armenian.
  In Armenian, the postnatal period does not cause difficulties in defining the meaning։ function.
 Armenian, having mastered the verb system of rich weather horses, fully distributes the weather meanings among the given horses, while in German the hypothetical, compulsory, weather meanings are partially expressed through the suffix horses.
  Partly because there are a number of other linguistic means in the language, such as modal verbs that perform the function.
  Grammatical time, however, does not reflect such temporal differences.
  The temporal distribution in the language is expressed in terms of time.
  Armenian grammarians rightly mention that the borderline tense is one of the least used.
 This is explained by the fact that the meaning of tomorrow is expressed in the form of hypothetical and forced weather.
 German places two's in this field, which, in the sense of time expressed by them, give rise to very contradictory interpretations.
  The second apostrophe in German expresses an assumption, a desire, an intention towards the action, event of the past, that is, all the semantic secondary manifestations that were revealed by the examination of the first apron.
  The difference is that the meanings mentioned by these horses are taken in relation to the past.
  The following semantic elements can be distinguished for the actions and events reported on the second day: • expression of the supposed action in relation to the past, • externalization of the supposed action of the past, • reporting of the action taken against the past.
The semantic element of the assumption of the eggs of the second shepherd is quite explainable by the presence of the weather elements of the supposition of the eggs of the shepherd.
 It is useful in cases when it is reported on the expected action as a confirmation, assumption, prediction.
 Whereas the postpositional meaning derives from the meaning of Infinitiv Perfekt in the second aparnic, where the auxiliary verb + Partizip II indicates postpositional meaning, such as Peterwird eingeschlafen sein. As a consequence or consequence of this sentence, it is assumed that he was going to sleep, he will be asleep until the moment that follows the performance of the action, being on the day after the given action.
 The meaning of the done, completed action here is also derived from the Perfekt composition of the second day, as Bald werden wir es geschafft haben. The second day in German, as a temporary egg, has a very limited use.
 It is in most cases interchangeable with Perfect temporal forms, when it appears in relation to the past or past participle, such as Wenn du morgen früh ins Büro kommst, binich wahrscheinlich schon losgefahren. Such expressions are mainly of a predictive nature, which may or may not be confirmed over time.
 German, by placing two temporal eggs in the sphere of the future, the first և the second's, opposes the Armenian with this feature.
  Modern Armenian places a period of one day in the afterlife.
  Some linguists accept the past tense of the past tense for the Armenian verb.
 In modern Armenian, the status of these's's is no longer debatable in the sense that these's are finally out of the verb tenses, not included in the verb tense.
Thus, examining the possibilities of the realization of the meaning of aparni in German, the grammatical forms of the realization of this meaning, it becomes clear that the most important components for the description of these forms are the exclusion of action from the moment of speech and its appearance after the moment of speech. as possible criteria.
 In the framework of this article, an attempt was made to answer such important questions as are directly related to the semantic-functional features of the apron due to the temporal-weather nature of these horses.
 In the case of Aparni, the "weather" limit of time reaches a minimum.
  This is confirmed by the presence of weather elements in the cliffs.
This article has a wide range of practical applications.
Such researches can be of great importance for the practical teaching of German, typological courses of German-Armenian languages, as well as for the clarification of translation problems.
