1. In the observations made to establish interactions between different fields of physics, methodological analyzes especially use quantitative estimates and comparisons of various physical parameters.
 As we know, it is possible to form combinations of these constants with a limited number of physical constants that have, for example, the dimensions of length, time, energy, mass, and other physical parameters.
 In this way, a large number of physical parameters can be theoretically comprehensible, expressing the latter with constants that are considered fundamental.
 And the separate groups of fundamental constants outline the areas of application of physical theories.
  Thus, the symbolic "map" of physical theories, which plays a guiding role in the overall perception of physical reality, is the subject of this observation, formed by comparative assessments of the emphasis on the roles of different fundamental constants.
  As such an estimate, it is customary to use the dimensionless ratio of physical quantities of the same size (e.g.
), which expresses a certain physical correlation.
And the sketching of a symbolic map is a topologically compatible combination of the applicability spheres of physical theories in a coordinate system dating back to the values ​​of different dimensionless relations, which must be of an obvious observational nature and reflect the physical validity of the cross-border transitions of individual theories.
 2. As we know, Aristotelian physics (also its medieval developments) was essentially a doctrine of the study of various properties attributed to a purely object.
 And the idea of ​​atomicity, already according to the ancient Greeks, this variety of physical properties tried to lead to only a limited number of basic properties characteristic of atoms.
 However, the followers of the principle of atomicity soon began to distinguish between the two categories of observed properties. properties that do not depend on the observer և belong only to the observed object (geometric dynamic properties), և properties that are conditioned by the perceptions of the observer.
  Galileo had already distinguished between "primary" and "secondary" properties such as physical objects, considering only the primary ones to be real, thus proposing a research program in classical physics.
 Thus, in classical physics, the primary features - egg, position, motion, mass, charge - are considered to be the objective characteristics of physical reality, the inseparable attributes of matter, which have nothing to do with observations.
  And that is why in order to establish quantities in classical physics, various macroscopic systems of measurement have been introduced, which are designed for the ordinary phenomena of ordinary physics, based on easily accessible, conditionally selected, approved macroscopic specimens.
  Such a conditional choice necessarily follows from the individual nature of the primary properties of the object under study.
  Thus, in the contour "map" of the applicability of physical theories, the domain allocated to classical physics has no definite guideline limitation.
3. The above-mentioned conceptual concept of classification of features was first questioned by Herbert և Stello's purely logical analysis, according to which the features (including the primary) of an object lead to a relationship with other objects.
 Helmholtz later emphasized the idea that the properties of objects are the effects they have on our senses or other objects in nature.
 Such claims were fully confirmed by the physics of modern times.
  Indeed, the further development of physical science has shown that all of the above attributes, which are considered primary, depend on the means of observation, on the relationship of the object with the latter.
  Thus, in contrast to Aristotelian features of physics և Newtonian physics of primary properties, the physics of modern times is characterized by another expressive language.
It is the language of interactions, interactions, not attributes.
 The elements of such linguistic thinking are processes, not properties and primary qualities.
Historically, various interactions (electrical, magnetic, gravitational) have been considered as certain features of physical bodies (matter) interacting at a distance.
 In contrast, Faraday first introduced the idea of ​​the field as a physical reality (a type of matter) that acts as an interconnecting mechanism of material bodies, subject to specific laws of motion.
  Such a view was, in fact, the further development of Descartes' theory of proximity.
 The further formulation of the laws of electromagnetic field motion in the form of field equations belongs, as we know, to Maxwell.
4. In his time, the invariance of Maxwell's equations to the coordinates and Lorentz transformations of time was especially emphasized, in contrast to Newton's equations, which are invariant to the Galilean transformations.
  That is, the field theory had to give way to the special theory of relativity.
  And the theory of relativity revealed that the geometrical-kinematic properties of position, time և velocity (equally length, length), which in the past were considered objective characteristics, actually depended on the choice of a computational system, that is, on the spatio-temporal nature of physical reality.
 The latter is expressed by emphasizing the role of one of the fundamental constants of nature in macrorelativistic mechanics, the velocity c of light, which in turn leads to the formation of "natural" rather than conditional units of measurement of physical quantities.
  Thus, in the outline map of physical theories, the delimitation of the domain allocated to macrorelativistic electrodynamics can be determined.
5. It was soon shown that the laws of motion of microparticles are qualitatively different from the laws of motion of macroscopic bodies.
And quantum mechanics was the first complete theory for microparticles.
  In the conceptual framework of Borney-Bori-Heisenberg interpretation, quantum mechanics is again the physics of processes, not the primary properties of the subject, the interactions, not the theatrics.
Indeed, at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, the principle of atomicity, or the principle of the interruption of all the forms and physical characteristics of matter, which is absolutely alien to classical physics, took on a central importance in the structural studies of matter.
  The logical analysis of the newly discovered reality showed that the hallmark of micro-F macro objects can be the reaction of the material object to the external influence, including the influence of the object at the time of viewing.
,1, cVcV The honor of extending the principle of atomicity to the interactions of material objects, that is, to the physical characteristics of the latter, belongs to Planck.
  According to Planck's minimum energy, it is a quantitative measure, the "firm", which plays the role of another inseparable "atom" of influence.
Thus, in the physics of the microcosm, the fundamental constants are crucial, which correspond to the physical reality of the atomic principle of charge, mass, and impact, while emphasizing the delimitation of the field of applicability of non-relativistic quantum mechanics in the outline map of physical theories.
is the action of the physical system).
6. The further development of quantum mechanics led to the creation of quantum electrodynamics, where the ideas of the particle և field merge into one general idea of ​​the quantum field, proving the physical reality of the creation and elimination of particles.
 For the electromagnetic field, the quantum electrodynamics created by Maxwell's equations, for the electron-positron field, by Dirac equations, based on the reformulation idea, which describes only the interactions of photons and leptons, is a very accurate theory.
  Quantum electrodynamics combines the achievements of the previous stage in the development of all physical science, namely, Maxwell's classical electrodynamics և quantum mechanics.
 In other words, in the outline map of physical theories, the field of quantum electrodynamics must topologically include the domains of previous developments, combining the basic constants used in the latter as a necessary և sufficient basis for the construction of "natural" units of measurement.
7. Physical phenomena in spatial reality նպատակով In order to subject the relevant physical theories to topological comparison, a basic

 However, it should be borne in mind that fundamental constants such as the electron charge mass are introduced into modern physical theories purely phenomenologically as a result of a process of reformulation, the idea of ​​which, of course, does not derive from the basic equations of quantum electrodynamics.
Given this situation, it is possible to get rid of the use of exaggerated estimates in locating the spheres of application of physical theories by limiting oneself only to the values ​​of relations.
  And given the reality of the course of physical phenomena in space, over time,
Excessive assessments should be supplemented by a spatial-scale assessment.
 Moreover, in applying the idea of ​​reformulation to quantitative electrodynamics in order to reconcile theoretical conclusions with experimental results, the hypothesis of the existence of a definite, very large, finite limit impulse is needed, considering that the values ​​of the impulse values ​​of interacting particles (electrons և photons) are smaller.
 So if the limit impulse is considered infinitely large, the electron charge will tend to zero.
 This result obtained by Landau և Pomeranchuk proves that quantum electrodynamics is not a closed, complete theory.
  In other words, quantum electrodynamics is not applicable to very large pulses.
  On the other hand, small distances correspond to large impulses.
 And it seems that quantum electrodynamics has no place in the range of short distances.
That is, in the outline map of physical theories it is necessary to introduce the third numerical axis of the underestimated estimates (except the axes), which must be dated by the values ​​of the relation.
  Estimates reflect spatial-temporal, respectively
  the behavior of matter moving in reality.
8. The existence of fundamental length is closely related to the need to reconsider traditional spatio-temporal notions on an ultra-small scale.
  According to Snyder, at such scales the space characterized by non-commutative coordinates with each other is discrete և at the same time isotropic.
 Moreover, the phenomena related to the possible quantization of the gravitational field become essential.
  In general, quantum physics has posed its question of the philosophical analysis of discontinuity in the microcosm.
  As we all know, the fundamental nature of the Planck constant is that it expresses all the physical characteristics by which interacting objects are exchanged.
  Indeed, a simple analysis of the dimensions confirms the following relation: [] = [energy x time] = [momentum x length] = [moment], (*) which allows for a dual interpretation.
  According to (*), it follows from the fact of quantization of an action S [...] that characterizes the dynamic state of a system, that if] = [energy x time], then it can be quantized, either the energy exchanged as a result of the interaction of physical objects, or time, b) energy, time.
By the same logic, if intermittently, it can be quantized] = [impulse x length], c) either the exchanged impulse or the length, d) "impulse" and "length".
ScVrr0rr0cVSrr0cVS ​​Since, according to modern physical notions, space և time in the microcosm remains constant, indefinitely divisible, the quantity, interruption of momentum of energy, impulse և moment is necessarily assumed.
  And if we take as a starting point this experimentally confirmed fact of interruption of energy, impulse and momentum, then the notions of possible quantization of space and time can already be considered physically grounded.
  And this is nothing but the spread of the idea of ​​the interruption of matter, of physical-physical characteristics, of its attributes, of space and time, for we can only mentally separate the interrelated physical realities of matter, motion, space, and temporally, at least marginally. .
9. Let us now draw an outline map of the alignment of physical theories, or rather a three-dimensional model, according to the coordinate (
) three-dimensional base.
 1) It is obvious that in the given coordinate system, classical physics occupies a one-dimensional range along the axis, which in principle lacks a certain delimitation.
2) The most general relativistic mechanics is defined by (
) with a two-dimensional (1x1) range of applicability located on the plane.
 The projection of the latter on the axis coincides with the one-dimensional domain of classical physics.
 This symbolic action is adequately derived from the equations of relativistic mechanics.

) the two-dimensional domain of the plane (1x1), և the projection of the latter on the axis again leads to the one-dimensionality of classical physics, fully in line with the boundary crossing.
rrcVS0,, rr0rrcV0, rr0crrS0, rr004) And finally, quantum electrodynamics, that is, quantum theory, which is a fusion of modern basic physical theories, quantum mechanics, relativity, is a quantitative relativistic, partial theory. is a 1x1x1 three-dimensional volume
in space.
10. The idea of ​​quantum electrodynamics has been developed in many respects.
 According to his example, other theories of elementary particle կառուց fundamental interactions have been constructed.
The idea of ​​a vacuum corresponding to the fields of different particles, corresponding to each of these fields, as the specificity of matter, which is the lower energy state of the quantized field, was established.
  Modern developments in elementary particle physics have shown that currently known particles (leptons, hadrons, quarks, gluons, photons) determine the specifics of microcosm processes.
 Similar to quantum electrodynamics, the theory of the gluon field, which determines the strong interaction of the quarks in the nucleus, causes quantum chromodynamics.
  We have already succeeded in creating the theory of weak interaction, where the electric rrcVS0,   magnetic և weak interactions are considered to be the most fundamental, the various manifestations of the weak interaction.
 The combination of the quantum model, the weak interaction և quantum chromodynamics is called the standard theory, the basic particles of which are leptons and quarks.
 The standard model framework has been able to explain a fairly comprehensive range of phenomena, although a number of crucial questions about the existence of fundamental interactions in nature remain unanswered.
 The successful fusion of electromagnetic և weak interactions in electromagnetism was the impetus for combining strong and gravitational interactions, this time into one, unique, large coupling theory.
  In this respect, the empirical discovery that the values ​​of the fundamental constants of the interactions of the interactions tend to converge is extremely important.
 Moreover, the extrapolation of these constants leads to the GeV value of energy.
 But since the existing accelerators manage to record the maximum GeV energy, the implementation of such extrapolation seems extremely uncertain.
 In addition, since there is still a quantum theory of gravitation that complements quantum electrodynamics and quantum chromodynamics, modern versions of the large unit theory still include only strong electroweak interactions.
 Thus, the universal union will take place in the high-energy domain, where the phenomena of emvant gravity are used.
In the contour model of physical theories, such developments correspond to the above-mentioned range of small velocities of the above-mentioned symbolic "cube", the large velocities of small distances diametrically opposite to the vertex A of the embryo of physical knowledge.
11. The cubic model gives rise to contemplative judgments.
 In particular, any section of a contour cube must conform to a certain physical theory, its system of dimensional estimates, which can be determined by the parameters of the section.
 And this points to the possibilities of new ways of interpreting physical reality.
  In addition, the fact that there are changes in the symmetry of the cube can lead to a certain conclusion 1510 ~ 3103 cVSrr 0.
 Indeed, in particular, in the case of inversion of the cube model to the origin of the coordinates, it (
transitions from coordinate octant (
) coordinate octant.
 Such an operation does not violate the proportionality of the dimensional model's simultaneous estimates և simultaneously makes changes that resemble, respectively, the actions of charge charge C, mirror reflection P, և time reversal T (assuming that the interaction of an electric charge is in the field of electromagnetic field. potentially).
 So the symmetry of the cubic model seems to be in line with the well-known beggar theorem.
  The presented version of the topology of the interconnections of physical theories is itself a reflection of the principle of fundamental symmetry of nature.
 According to this principle, the fundamental length determines modern physical notions, that is, quantum mechanics.
, the limits of the principled applicability of the theory of relativity և causality [7].
  In other words, we should expect new physical phenomena in the spatial domains that do not correspond to the possible modern notions, that is, one "revolutionary" development of physical science, as took place at the beginning of the 20th century.
So, in all probability, any model structure from the measurements is inevitably temporary.
 Further theoretical and experimental discoveries in the microcosm, expanding explorations of the universe, inevitably breaking any completed model, will cut the latter into new components, rrcVS0,, rrcVS0,, VVrrSS ,, baiidxAceiACPTP 1 ~, ~ 00rrrr1 ~ S1 ~ cV0rr until a new tendency for unification at a higher level arises.
And in the future, such developments of scientific thought are not ruled out, when instead of a three-dimensional model, it will be necessary to be satisfied with four-dimensional, even multidimensional model structures.
