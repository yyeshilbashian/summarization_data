Introduction.
  Hail is one of the main hydro-hydrological natural disasters observed in the territory of the republic.
  Hail-bearing agriculture suffers great material damage.
  Suffice it to say that 85-90% of the total amount paid for the damage caused by disasters refers to hail.
 According to official calculations, every year in Armenia hail causes 16-20 billion drams of damage to the agriculture.
In Armenia, orchards and vineyards are especially affected by hailstorms during flowering, as well as cereals and vegetable crops.
The analysis showed that even one case of hail in a year can destroy almost the entire crop of grapes, causing great damage to the economy.
The intensity and frequency of dangerous weather and climate events have increased in recent decades.
 Therefore, the study of the geographical distribution of hail and its origin, frequency, intensity, development of effective forecasting methods, organization of prevention service, warning are among the current issues.
 However, there are still many gaps in that direction, which require complex studies and large financial investments.
Taking into account the above-mentioned, the aim of the work is to discuss, reveal և analyze the patterns of spatial-temporal distribution of hail days in the territory of the Republic of Armenia, according to separate meteorological stations.
Material և method.
 A number of works are dedicated to the study of hail in the territory of the republic.
  These works cover և reveal the peculiarities of alpinism that contribute to thunderstorms [6], aerosynoptic conditions of hail formation [3-4, 7], spatio-temporal features of hail distribution [4,8-10], conditions that determine the development of thunderstorms [4] ].
For the purpose of the study, the results of the actual observations of the meteorological representation stations operating in the territory of the Republic of Armenia were used as a starting material, which are stored in the RA Ministry of Emergency Situations Hydrometeorological Service.
 Mathematical-statistical, geographical, comparison-analysis, correlation methods were used in the work.
Note that the hail is an ice ball with a layered structure with a radius of 1-25 mm (in some cases, it is more than 15 cm).
 It consists of whitish milky core և successive transparent և opaque layers of ice.
 The mass of hail in a separate case can exceed 300 grams.
 The velocity of its grain falls directly to the square root of the size of the radius.
As a rule, the formation and development of hail are conditioned by strong upstream currents reaching speeds of up to 30 m / s.
Hail requires high cloud moisture, which is why hail falls only during the warm season of the year at high temperatures (15-20 C) near the earth's surface.
  Most often hail falls in temperate latitudes, and with the greatest intensity in turns.
 No hail is seen at the latitudes.
Usually, hail is in the place of piles of rain clouds.
  As a rule, hail is almost always accompanied by heavy rain, thunderstorms, sometimes strong winds (up to 15 m / s or more), like a storm.
In some cases, along with heavy rainfall, hail is caused by mudslides.
  As a result, the economy is damaged not only by hail, but also by floods.
Hail is observed in the territory of the republic during frontal-mass hail processes.
  Intra-mass hail processes are observed in spring առաջին in the first half of summer, when convective currents are developed, և high humidity.
It turned out [4] that the diameter of the hail in the territory of the Republic of Armenia fluctuates in the range of 0.5-6.0 cm.
 The size of the hailstone is functionally related to the speed of convective currents. The higher the velocity of the convective currents, the larger the diameter of the hailstones.
The intensity of hail fluctuates in large limits, from a few seconds to 1 hour.
 Usually, the hail lasts 3-5 minutes.
 The hail, as a rule, is located in a route occupying different surfaces, the width of which is often 1-2 km (in some cases up to 10 km), the length - 10-20 km (in some cases - up to 400 km).
We have not studied the hail և local time schedule.
 It is another subject of study, which is beyond the scope of this work.
 This paper presents only some of the results of studies conducted by other authors.
Thus, it turned out [4] that the hail in the territory of the Republic of Armenia lasts for 3 to 30 minutes.
  The layer of hail can reach 40 cm. The thickness of the road, and the length of the road layer - 100-120 km.
 For example, on June 6, 2005, the length of the hail route reached 100-120 km in the Maralik region, and the strength of the hail layer reached 30 cm.
The repetition of hail from a few minutes to 15 minutes in most stations in the Caucasus is 70-90%.
 Usually, the recurrence of hail in 45 minutes to 1 hour և does not exceed 10%, and in Armenia - 5% [10].
The hail is mostly in the afternoon, in the evening, from 13:00 to 24:00.
 At the same time, about 75% of hail falls on the mentioned hour, the remaining 25% is distributed as follows: 15% at night 10 10% in the first half of the day [10].
The greatest recurrence of hail in the Ararat valley is observed at 1200-1500.
 The recurrence of hail in the basins of Lake Sana և Hrazdan River is equally large at 1200-1500 and 1500-1800.
  In the rest of the republic, the biggest hailstorm is mainly observed at 1500-1800.
 The next place is occupied by the period from 1800-2100.
 Quite rare hail is observed at 900-1200 hours, and unique cases of hail are observed between 0000-0900.
Results և discussion.
  As a result of the research, it was found out that hailstorms are registered in the republic from April to October, sometimes in the remaining months.
 A large number of hail days are observed in May (regions with dry land climate) and June (regions with relatively humid climate).
During the mentioned months hail is observed almost in the whole territory of the republic every year, in the remaining months at altitudes of more than 2000 m.
 Hail phenomena are observed more often in high mountainous regions, but with less intensity.
The number of hail days is very disproportionately distributed in the republic due to its imitation alpine peculiarities (Table 1).
 The Aragatsillar massif stands out with a large number of hail days per year.
 Thus, the average annual high value of hail days in the country is observed at Aragats b / l meteorological station - 8.2 days (the maximum was registered in 1938 և was 40 days).
 The average annual annual value of hail is observed in the lowlands of the republic վրա on the water surface։.
 Thus, in the Ararat valley the latter fluctuates within 1-3 days, in the coastal area of ​​Lake Sanaa - 2-3 days (leaving the lake, it increases), in Meghri - 1-2 days.
The number of days with hail is subject to upward zoning laws.
 As the local altitude increases, so does the number of hail days.
  However, due to local peculiarities, sometimes a violation of the mentioned regularity is noticed.

) between values.
 It can be expressed accordingly with the following equations.
In the first case, the correlation coefficient was:
, second.
  Even better results would be obtained if in the case of hail
The dependence of the annual number of days was discussed according to the separated agro-climatic regions.
It is obvious that the number of days with hail changes according to the positions and orientations of the slopes.
 However, it requires special studies.
The most active hail activity in the period under study was observed in 1936-37, 1939-40, 1942-44, 1947, 1950-51, 1954-55, 1963 և 1965, when the maximum number of hail days was observed in a large part of the republic, which was 2-3 և more than the multi-year average.
 Weak hail activity was observed in 1980, 1985, 1992-94, 2000.
 During those years, hail in a significant part of the territory of the republic was either not observed at all, or the recurrence did not exceed 2-3 days during the year.
Studies show that the recurrence of hail in the same place varies quite a lot.
 For example, in Dilijan, Fanta and other meteorological stations, hail can fall on individuals for more than 10 days.
 On the other hand, possible years when there is no hail at all.
 It should be noted that with the increase of altitude and land-climate, an increase in the absolute value of the annual amplitude of hail repetition fluctuations is observed. At Aragats b / l meteorological station it is 40 days.
 This circumstance, no doubt, is conditioned by the nature of the general circulation of the atmosphere of separate years.
It turned out that in the territory of the republic there is a tendency of decreasing the annual number of days with eclipse (Fig. 1).
  A similar pattern is observed in other studies [2, 4].
As already mentioned, hail causes great damage to the economy.
 From the point of view of natural hazards, about 15-17% of the territory of the republic is under the influence of hail [1, 9].
 The decreasing trend of the annual number of hail days does not mean a reduction of the caused damages.
  The reason is that the amount of damage caused by hail depends on the size of the hailstones.
 Small intensive hail causes significant damage to agricultural crops.
 Hail with a diameter of 10-15 mm is more dangerous.
 It should be noted that often even one case of hail during the year can lead to the complete destruction of crops, while in other regions a large number of hail days can cause insignificant damage.
 It, of course, depends on the size of the hail grain, its intensity, the length, as well as the stage of plant development, and finally the surface of the hail.

Years Fig. 1. Dynamics of change in the annual number of days with hail During 1935-2010, according to the data of several meteorological stations of the Republic of Armenia 1 - Tashir; 2 - Aparan; 3 - Fanta; 4 - Go down; 5 - Martuni; 6 - Sisian Hail with a large number of days is observed in the highlands. In the isolated highlands, where there are almost no agricultural crops.
 However, it should be taken into account that the settlements in the republic are mainly located at altitudes up to 2000 m.
  Hailstorms in higher areas cause little or no damage.
 On the other hand, hail mainly affects expensive crops, first of all, grapes (up to 1500-1600 m above sea level), certain types of fruits (up to 1900-2000 m above sea level), as well as grain crops.
The greatest destruction of grapes and other plants is observed in the first stage of vegetation.
 This is due to the instability of the meteorological conditions of that time, which is a result of convection.
An attempt is made to prevent hail in the republic.
 However, this problem is not completely solved yet!
  Currently, there are 119 anti-hail stations in the hail-hazardous regions of the republic (Armavir, Aragatsotn, Ararat, Lori marzes), which protect 9400 hectares of land.
 Although mountainous areas are more dangerous, hailstorms are less, therefore anti-hail stations are first installed in the areas where intensive cultivation of agricultural crops is carried out.
Conclusions և Recommendations.
 Thus, hail is one of the main hydropower disasters, which causes great damage to agriculture.
  Almost the whole territory of the republic is dangerous for hail.
  Moreover, the damage caused by hail in mountainous areas is either absent or insignificant.
The number of hail days in both the same and nearby areas varies considerably.
An increase in the number of hail days is observed in the territory of the republic, according to the local altitude.
 The maximum number of hail days during the year is registered in mountainous and high mountainous regions, where agricultural crops are almost absent.
 A correlation was obtained between the altitude տեղի the annual number of hail days և, which was expressed analytically.
 The resulting link can be used to estimate the number of hail days in less studied և unexplored areas.
In the territory of the republic, in general, there is a tendency of decreasing the number of days with hail.
  However, this does not mean a reduction in hail damage.
 Therefore, it is necessary to pay special attention to the intensity of hail, as well as its size.
We offer: • Detailed և systematic study and evaluation of different intensities հաճախ frequency of hail of different sizes, dynamics of change, damage caused; • Development of short-term hail forecasting methods for as small areas as possible; Spatial correct distribution of anti-hail stations, • Ensuring high efficiency of work with as few anti-hail stations as possible, • Comprehensive study of physical-geographical features of hail-protected areas;• Study of their impact on aircraft crossing the impact zone of anti-hail stations; • Development of new, more effective methods of hail control.
