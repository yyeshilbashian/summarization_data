The dynamics of investments in the world economy and the indicators of countries' participation in lending relations are often unpredictable.
  Foreign direct investment (FDI) is constantly under the influence of external factors.
  Therefore, identifying the causes of the growth or decline of foreign direct investment and their consequences on economic development and making sensible decisions is the main condition for an effective investment policy.
 FDI inflows to the global economy in 2016, compared to the previous year, decreased by 13% to $ 1.52 trillion.
  This decline has led to a global decline in economic activity, and the reasons were due to reduced investment flows in some countries.
  It is noteworthy that in transition countries in 2016 compared to the previous year increased by 30% (+52 billion dollars), in developing countries decreased by 20% (-600 billion dollars), and in developed countries - by 9% (-872 mld dollars) 1.
  In the context of these tendencies of activation of investments in transition countries, let us try to assess the investment environment and the current state of economic development in Armenia.
 According to the RA National Statistical Service, in 2017 126 ECONOMICS (difference between receipts and repayments on foreign investments) in the real sector of the Armenian economy in the first half of 2016 amounted to -1 188.3 million drams, which is about 5% less than in 2016. 2 and almost 44% lower than the registered index of the same index of 2015. In 2015, it amounted to 30,701.7 million drams3.
 2015 The volume of net investment flows in Armenia was relatively high, which, however, is lower than in 2014. to the same index.
 The index has been declining since 2011.
  Speaking about the high level of investments in 2012 and 2013, it should be noted that in the same period, Armenia was ranked among the CIS countries with the lowest FDI in terms of FDI, with $ 500 million and less investment flows4.
 2017 In January-June, the bulk of the net inflow of foreign direct investment, 31.6 billion drams, was directed to the mining sector.
  At the same time, large investments were made in real estate operations (3.8 billion drams) and basic metals production (3.7 billion drams).
  On the contrary, in 2017 In the first half of the year, compared to the previous year, a sharp decline in investment flows was registered in the sectors of telecommunications (-17.9 billion drams) and beverage production (-9.5 billion drams).
  2017 The largest source of foreign investment in the first half of the year was the island of Jersey (one of the most famous offshore zones in the world), from which the net inflow of capital resources amounted to about 31.6 billion drams.
  These funds were fully directed only to the mining industry and related sectors.
  In terms of net inflow of FDI, Jersey was followed by Luxembourg (2.4 billion drams) and Cyprus (1.8 billion drams), which are also large offshore zones.
 2016 The volume of net inflows of foreign investments in the real sector in January-December 2017 (Socio-economic situation of foreign RA in January-June 2017, p. 103, http.

  The volume of net FDI inflows in 2016 decreased by 6,747.5 million drams (9.7%) compared to the previous year.
  The study of the dynamics of FDI shows that the index decreased during the same period in almost all countries (except for a few countries), which was due to the fact that the obligations assumed towards that country were repaid.
  The decline in indicators was influenced by repayments and reduction of investments.
 Figure 1. Net FDI volumes by countries in 2015-2016. (Million AMD) 5 Among the countries represented in the observed period, the most remarkable, in terms of volume, was the reduction of investment flows from Russia, the growth of investments from Cyprus.

 According to the National Statistical Service, in 2014 The level of Russian investments in the first half of the year amounted to 36,434.8 million drams, in 2015 - 3,432.6 million drams, ie it decreased almost tenfold.
  2016 The index made -5 686.9 million drams, ie the repayment exceeded the receipt, and in 2017. in the first half of the year - -12 298.0 million drams6.
  The reduction of Russian investments in the sphere of electricity production from -8,100.6 million drams to -13,995.5 million drams is significant in the same period, ie by almost 73%.
  2011 In the structure of investments made by Russia from other countries, the volume of investments directed to Armenia made 1 370 million dollars, which is 1.7% of the total volume of investments7.
 It should be noted that although Armenia is a member of the EEU, there is still no significant progress in investment relations with any of its members, given that it should not be limited to the creation of a customs union, but should ensure greater economic integration of member states. wide possibilities.
  On the contrary, if before Armenia became a member of the EEU, investments from Russia were 42,646.5 million drams (in 2014), then in 2015 That index decreased to 35,983.3 million drams.
 2014-2017 The study of the dynamics of the net inflow of Russian investments in the first half of the year once again proves the still low level of Armenia-Russia economic cooperation within the EEU, if not the incomprehensible nature of that cooperation and the not promising prospect.

Volumes of net flows of FDI by sectors 2015-2016 As of (million AMD) 8, the largest sectors in Armenia with FDI are mining and beverage production, with the exception of mining, in other sectors a decline was recorded in the period under review.
 In 2016, 73% (30.5 billion drams) of investments in the mining industry belonged to the United Kingdom, 24% (10.2 billion drams) to the British island of Jersey (which is a well-known offshore zone), and 3% (1.2%). billion drams) to the Russian Federation.
  2015-2016 The Lydian Armenia Company, which operates the Amulsar gold mine and is 100% owned by the British offshore company Lydian International Limited and is registered in the offshore zone of the British Jersey Island, has been quite active.
  This circumstance explains the above-average share of FDI sent to Armenia from Jersey to the total volume of foreign capital invested in the sector.
  Note that from Jersey in 2015 No investment flows were registered, and the net flow of investments from the UK in one year almost tenfold. Socio-economic situation in Armenia in January-February 2017, p. 78, http.

  2014 The net flow of investments from the UK amounted to 2.7 billion drams.
  2017 In the first quarter, the level of British investments amounted to more than one billion drams, which had a fivefold increase compared to the same period last year.
 As many offshore companies do not pay taxes in that country when operating outside the country of registration, and the repatriation of currency, including investment profits, is not under the control of that country, the transfer of funds to the state budget and investment-economic development becomes the case. are unrealistic.
 In 2016, compared to the previous year, the foreign capital invested in the production of beverages decreased by 2.7 billion drams (by 26%).
  Although the index has decreased, the proportion of capital distribution invested in the sector by countries has been maintained.
  The largest share of French investments - 79% (6.2 billion drams), the British - 15.5% (1.2 billion drams), and the remaining 5.5% (422.8 million drams) belongs to Luxembourg.
 Among the indicators under study, perhaps the most significant are the negative investment trends in the food industry. In particular, there were no investment flows in 2015 and 2016. respectively - 340.1 million drams and -1 386.0 million drams, while in 2015 it amounted to 129.5 million drams.
 Dozens of investment programs in various spheres are currently being financed in Armenia, the results of which can be evaluated in years to come, measuring efficiency by job creation, GDP growth, increasing market share, strengthening positions, raising the country's rating.

By the end of the year, investments will reach $ 492.8 million, which will create about 7,300 new jobs10.
 Speaking of the achievements or failures of previous years' investments, there is still no significant progress in boosting employment and preventing emigration, as the traditional machine-building, processing, textile, and chemical industries are seen as the backbone of the country's economy. pledge, in Armenia continues to remain not only underdeveloped, but also out of state care and attention.
  In addition to these branches, it is necessary to develop the military industry as an absolutely new direction, for which the Ministry of Economic Development and Investment, http.
 //www.mineconomy.am, entry date: 28.09.2017 133 ECONOMICS Systemic changes and approaches are needed to increase the inflow of Diaspora investments.
  The military industry will be one of the best stimuli for economic development.
 Although the establishment of preferential customs regimes is considered an important step in terms of investment promotion, this privilege is highly relative and subjective, which can have a very weak impact on business promotion.
  In case of import of goods exceeding 200 million drams within the framework of investment programs from 2011 by the decision of the Government of the Republic of Armenia, the term of VAT payment calculated by the customs bodies may be postponed for up to 3 years.
  Note three main points. First, the government determines the list of these companies or individual entrepreneurs, ie a selection is made.
  Then, there is no tax exemption for 3 years, but only a postponement of tax payment terms, while 3 years is a very short period for the establishment of start-up companies.
  The next important consideration is the following: we are talking about the volume of such investments (imported industrial goods, raw materials, equipment), which mainly refers to medium and large businesses.
  Therefore, this privilege can not be a significant stimulus for the development of small business in practice.
 The report of the RA Government states that in 2017 In the first 8 months, $ 376 million was invested in Armenia, of which direct investments - $ 328 million. dollars.
  For 28 of the investment programs received from the private sector, privileges of exemption from customs duties were established, for 19 - privileges of VAT deferral.
  It should be noted that it is not a large number, besides, only certain companies use the privilege.
  For example, by the decision of the Government of the Republic of Armenia, the VAT payment of the "Lydian Armenia" company operating the Amulsar gold mine for importing equipment worth 26.7 billion drams was postponed for 3 years.
  In this case, giving a tax privilege to such a large offshore company is devoid of any economic justification and does not follow from the concept of economic development and economic security of the Republic of Armenia.
 For reasons of economic and national security, one should not enthusiastically accept the large volumes of investments made by foreign offshore companies in the mining sector and their growth and be excited by the large volume of products in the export structure, as in this case part of the national wealth and the result belongs to offshore companies. Mines are often exploited in violation of basic environmental norms.
  As a result, in fact, we are dealing with a very inefficient model of the use of natural and human resources of the Republic of Armenia, which the Government of the Republic of Armenia has been ignoring for years.
  Investments and our resources (including scientific ones) should be directed especially to scientific fields, as the volumes of science-based products are growing in the world, which are able to create an image, change the face and prestige of countries.
  There are quite promising areas in Armenia, where the ability to bring multiple growth of investments is more visible.
  In addition to the development of IT and tourism (which are declared priority areas), public investment policy should work in favor of the development of environmentally friendly industries (alternative energy, organic food production, etc.) instead of short-term mining.
  2017 As of today, there are more than 70 mining companies operating in Armenia, most of them with foreign capital, the result of which is barely 2.2% of GDP (average in 2015-2016), and 31% of exports (2015).
 According to international rating organizations, which take into account several essential directions of the country's development, Armenia has different ranking positions among the countries of the world.
 135 ECONOMICS Table 2 Armenia's position in international rankings according to the World Bank 11 Position among the countries (2017) Change compared to the previous year Doing business (in general) 38 +5 Starting a business 9 remained the same Building permits 81 -3 Property registration 13 remained the same Loan receipt 20 +22 Investor Protection 53 -2 Tax Payment 88 Remains the Same Economic Freedom 33 +21 Human Development Index 85 +2 Directions Based on Transparency International estimates that in 2016 Armenia ranked 113th out of 176 countries in the Corruption Perceptions Index was on the spot 12. This is probably the worst of the observed indicators.
  In such a situation, it is absurd to talk about an attractive investment environment.
  Note that different rating agencies award different rating points.
  For example, in 2016 "Fitch" organization is the international credit of our country http.
 //www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/armenia, access date: 30.09.2017 https:
 //www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016, accessed 07.10.2017 136 ECONOMICS rated B + which is considered stable and "Moody's" Ba3 which is considered negative.
  13 A study of the composition and structure of FDI in the Republic of Armenia showed that 2016 was the most unsuccessful year in terms of investments during the last few years.
  The reasons are mainly of a political nature: the April four-day, July internal political events, the formation of a new government, 2017. parliamentary elections, which could not but create expectations and additional risks among existing and potential investors.
  The next factor is the economy: Armenia's small market, export-related problems, public debt, import monopolization and market centralization.
  Demographic factors, such as increasing emigration, also have an impact.
  There are many investors who do not consider Armenia an attractive country, simply because of bureaucratic hassles, corruption, pockets and participation complicating registration procedures, which are really serious obstacles, for example, to invest the financial potential of Diaspora Armenian businessmen in the national economy.
  We will have a clearer picture of the change in the economic situation as a result of the reduction of investment flows, if we consider it in the context of economic growth indicators.
  According to the NSSRA and the Central Bank, economic growth in 2014 was 3.4%, in 2015 - 3%, and in 2016 it was 0.2%, projected at 2.2% compared to.
 As a result of evaluating the directions and tendencies of investment of foreign financial resources, it is necessary to notice another fact. The fact of the decline in the volume of investments of the main partner state, Russia, in the real sector of the Republic of Armenia does not fit into the logic of cooperation within the EEU and the resulting economic and business environment.
  Received http from British and other offshore companies.
 //www.amcham.am/img/Investment_guide_Armenia.pdf, date of entry: 07.10.2017 137 ECONOMICS The growth of investment resources, particularly in the mining sector, proves that the leading sector in terms of investment and exports is still the mining industry, but inefficient in terms of business environment, economic development, employment and animation.
  This circumstance is another proof of the fact that it is a raw material attachment in the world market.
  Therefore, the promotion of investments should not be declarative or end in itself and should not solve a short-term problem, but should be based on the concepts of strategic development of the country, raising the living standards of the people and preventing emigration.
