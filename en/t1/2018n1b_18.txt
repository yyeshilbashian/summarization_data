One of the primary goals of education today is to develop the learner's self-thinking, reasoning skills, problem-solving skills, and other skills.
 This can be achieved in various ways: the necessary program changes, the provision of an appropriate learning environment, the application of a variety of methods and practical tasks that contribute to the qualitative change of knowledge and worldview, the evaluation of education, etc.
Coverage of the peculiarities of integrated learning In the next work we want to analyze and offer multiple goals and multiple practical possibilities for different tasks in the teaching process (both general and professional).
The educator, as the organizer of the content of education, integrates planning, like any other type of lessons, providing different ways of organizing teaching and different types of tasks.
Assignments can be a guide for teachers and lecturers in setting lesson goals and outcomes when planning a lesson.
 These tasks include all components of education content: knowledge, skills, value system, can describe, according to Benjamin Bloom scale, different levels of learner cognitive achievement: memory - perception of meaning - application - analysis - synthesis (comparison) - evaluation (evaluation) [ 4; 6].
 Depending on the purpose, each of the tasks presented by us can be used in different ways.
  Let's present the above by showing the multi-purpose practical meanings of the tasks with the most frequently used tables in the process of teaching different subjects, with a special example of biology.
In the process of teaching biology, tables can be made for different purposes.
 For example, to stimulate և develop the learner's attention, comparative skills, symbolic thinking (as it may often be necessary to create or use symbols), diligence in reading, source research, classifying information by choice, possible from impossible, primary from secondary, effective ineffective, ineffective to summarize ideas, to fully comprehend and assimilate information, to ensure logical sequence and completeness of material, to self-examine, to ask questions, to identify errors and omissions, to edit, as well as non-verbal communication, to use time efficiently;
Therefore, the presentation of knowledge by the learner in the form of a table in accordance with the set goal, in our opinion, is one of the most telling evidence of the extent of his knowledge, depth and degree of mastery.
When teaching biology, spreadsheets can be used at different stages of lesson organization.
 For example, the positive, negative, in some cases neutral aspects of the phenomenon, comparing, analyzing the structure and function, the cause and effect correlation, the nature of the organism's devices related to environmental conditions, identifying or comparing the same organ-systemic levels of different disciplinary groups; To develop students' ability to find patterns in the material և Tables can be created for other purposes: 1) in parallel with the lesson explanation, to facilitate the comprehension of the material;
 In addition to developing the above features, compiling charts required by the learner will enable the teacher to identify the strengths and weaknesses of students who usually have difficulty expressing themselves orally, presenting what they know (which is also suitable for organizing some inclusive education for children), 3) for knowledge testing .
 For the latter, we offer a variety of variations to test different standard levels.
In all cases, a clear methodological approach to compiling tables is the precise wording of the claim, which, according to the methodology, should be proposed by command or query.
 This requirement also applies to the formulation of any other task.
 For example, the most common form of a knowledge table is the following: a) Fill in the table showing the endocrine glands and their functions.
Endocrine GlandHormoneHormoneGland is the name of the hormone produced by the function of the hormone gland. B) In another variant of the table, only the first two columns, or one of the third or fourth columns, can be left.
c) It is possible to suggest one of the columns or (if there are more than two) several complete ones, and the learner will be instructed to complete it.
d) Nominate one of the columns into a complete, the other a partitioned table, requiring you to fill in the blanks of the table, which may be headings, etc.
e) Suggest that the learner, based on the content of the completed columns in the table, choose a co-author of the main lines left blank.
For students with the least progress: f) nominate some boxes in all the columns of the table, requiring them to fill in the blanks on their own.
It is advisable to develop the skills of creating spreadsheets, starting with small information, gradually moving to the development of the ability to combine individual small pieces of information, and then to present the larger material in a spreadsheet.
  In this sequence, the skill can be developed through independent, unappreciated assignments, focusing on the need to see the connection between the title and the content of the table, to get rid of redundant information, to choose a more accurate title, to ask the right questions to check the table, etc.
Below we will present some of the tasks, some of which are most common in pedagogical practice, wanting to emphasize their non-exhaustive practical possibilities and goals.
 And let us remind you that the tasks with their multi-purpose approach can be used for organizing whole lessons, as well as for organizing any step of any lesson, both for teaching by the teacher and for presenting the learning outcomes of the learner.
Because the combination of the same methodological approach in the stages of "teaching" and "learning" will be the best guarantee for the learner to acquire the skills and abilities that the teacher has set as a goal of organizing the training and the expected end result.
1) Submission of the material with combined explanations.
  It is the most popular learning tool, it provides a teacher-learner, learner-learner dialogue.
 It can be accompanied by slides, pictures, films, diagrams with the aim of clarifying and facilitating the process of information perception, assimilation, ensuring the involvement of different senses, developing and developing the skills of summarizing, systematically presenting information, distinguishing the primary from the secondary, modeling.
 Combining explanations with media presentations helps to motivate learning.
  And as individual or group homework, student media presentations not only help to increase the effectiveness of learning, but also develop the skills of self-organization հստակ clear group work, self-assessment of others' abilities, fostering friendships, mutual help and responsibility և etc.
2) Clarification of the material, using parallels and similarities of different knowledge.
 Such tasks can be used to develop comparative skills, to analyze causal, structural, and functional relationships, to use knowledge in one field to solve problems in another, to apply basic natural laws to explain different natural phenomena, and to create worldviews of harmony and unity through analogies.
  For example, it may seem surprising at first glance, but the vector of analysis of many examples of biological structural-functional units, behavioral inherited traits can be directed towards the upbringing of patriotism and humanity.
  In particular, in explaining the mechanism of migration of birds and many fish, emphasizing the pattern that these animals live in adulthood in a certain, stable environment, but to reproduce necessarily return to their homeland with the most favorable conditions, often having to cross a very long, difficult lake. fish often have to resist the current).
  By the principle of similarities, comparing what is described with human thinking, one can successfully arrive at the upbringing of patriotism, calling for the primary possibility of reproduction in the homeland for the preservation and development of the species.
The explanation of the structural feature of red blood cells, erythrocytes, can be considered as an example of educating humanity and devotion by the principle of causal analysis.
 The cell has lost the nucleus, its most important organoid, which would allow the cell to multiply, "rejuvenate" in order to accumulate hemoglobin in the volume occupied by the nucleus, by which the cell must deliver oxygen to all cells in the body. from the amount of oxygen received.
  The logical continuation of this approach is the analysis of the patterns of energy distribution of the oxygen-'s energy-breathing phases.
 By drawing students' attention to the proportions of energy released into the environment in the form of heat energy released from the complete energies released in the two phases of the cell cycle, from 150 kJ to 90 kJ in the oxygen phase and from 2650 kJ to 1570 kJ in the respiratory phase, kindness can be achieved in human relations. to the idea.
  This logic will become more impressive and vivid when spicing the word with folk wisdom, for example, when other wisdoms of the will "Do good, throw it in the water" are mentioned as an analogy.
  With such an approach, one can point to examples in the analysis of any organ-system և to educate not only Christian ethics, but also to develop ideas of the perfection of nature, the generality of patterns operating at different levels of living systems, և to ensure the development of a high value system.
 Today, these are one of the primary goals of education, particularly integrated learning.
Tasks using the principle of parallels and similarities can be concepts of comparative tables, covering knowledge, showing logical sequence, creating interdisciplinary connections on different principles, classification diagrams, mapping of concepts, explanation of terms, composition, composition, composition, composition, composition, composition, composition, composition, composition, composition, composition, composition, composition. , mystery, riddle, symbolic wisdom, song, film, picture) through other forms of analysis of works with naturalistic and bio-philosophical thinking [2; 3; 4].
3) Analysis of examples of bionic և science fiction phenomena.
 Applicable for the same purposes as 2).
 In addition, it stimulates the learner's cognitive activity, develops the imagination by the example of integration of biological and engineering, technical knowledge, develops ideas about the diversity of fields of practical application of knowledge, the possibility of acquiring and integrating knowledge, the perfection of nature and common ground. is for everyone to organize their life properly և etc.
4) Experiments, laboratory, practical works.
  First of all, it develops working skills to apply theoretical knowledge in practice.
 Develops attention, ability to plan work, design, analyze results, draw conclusions, make inferences and suggestions, self-assessment, flexible, creative attitude in unexpected situations և other skills.
5) Role play, trial, analysis of the causes and consequences of the problems.
 The latter is very convenient to organize using the "Wheel of the Future" method.
  Role-playing and trial formulate and develop skills for acting in different roles, evaluating and analyzing different perspectives on the same question, substantiating one's point of view, flexibility in different situations, honesty, shaping ideas about causation, integration into one's own person, knowledge and nature. civic consciousness, worldview և etc.
6) Material analysis through questionnaires.
 A series of questions should be developed to take the problem from simple to complex, to maintain a logical sequence, to learn the logic of the learner, the causal links of the phenomena, the basic principle of the connection between the structure and the function of learning, to develop the consciousness of constructive learning.
 To a large extent, it provides an interactive atmosphere, activates the cognitive process, develops logical thinking, the skills of formulating questions, the perception of causal phenomena, the inability to draw conclusions and suggestions, ensures the perception of the integrity of the phenomenon [1].
7) Creation of handicrafts.
 Develops practical knowledge of practical knowledge, preparation of self-made educational materials, secondary waste treatment work skills, develops a sense of nature appreciation, implements resource-saving attitudes, such as aesthetic, work and environmental education of taste.
8) Discussion of essays, interesting information.
Writing an essay first and foremost forms and develops research skills (topic selection և justification of meaning, planning, application of title page և other technical requirements, formulation of links, conclusions, creation of a list of literature ևayl), teaches to plan work, search for sources, create logical connections, various information to construct a literate word, to substantiate an opinion, to evaluate, to evaluate, to formulate conclusions and suggestions.
 The discussion of essays develops and develops the skills of appearing in front of the audience, presenting, constructing a literate oral speech, answering questions and communicating with the audience.
Fascinating information is called that, because it helps to cover, enrich, make the information pictorial.
They promote not only logical but also emotional expression towards learning, expand the scope of cognitive knowledge.
9) Rebuses, crossword puzzles, transcripts, competition questions, predictions according to a picture, exhibition or history.
  Such tasks provide greater involvement of learners, make learning more lively, interesting, train the brain, facilitate perception and memory, create a playful atmosphere, enhance the emotional approach to learning, develop imagination, creativity, logical, associative and symbolic thinking. consciousness և etc.
10) Writings on problematic issues, multifaceted analysis of works of art.
 They develop the written word of mouth, to analyze the phenomenon comprehensively, to evaluate objectively (historical period, geographical location, level of civilization, social relations, linguistic thinking);
 They form and develop a civic awareness of the unity of the universe, the interconnectedness of phenomena, the place and role of one's own person in relation to the nature of people, a worldview.
Naturally, the presented does not exhaust the possibilities of organizing the training process for dedicated specialists.
 However, the emphasis on the ability to use all types of tasks analyzed in the work for multiple purposes will enrich each specialist-methodological approach to providing quality education, will help to apply the two approaches we have outlined in the process of organizing updated learning. Replacing the teaching methods of imparting "assessed" mechanical knowledge with substandard teaching skills that would enable learners to self-discover knowledge, develop an integrated approach to phenomena, .
Such a creative approach to the organization of the daily learning process by all professionals will not only make it more effective and interesting, but will also increase the interest and involvement of students in the learning process, the absence of which is one of the undeniable facts in this educational system.
