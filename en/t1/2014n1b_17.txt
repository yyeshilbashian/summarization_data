The Armenian ethnos at that time (9-10 centuries), living under foreign rule, did not have an independent state - politicalsystem, with the philosophy of survival has acquired inferioritycomplex, especially xenophobia.
The ruling political elite, taking into account the foreign interests of such people under religious-ethnic coercion, has made every effort.To spread the way of life, values ​​and language of the dominant ethnos in Armenia at the expense of the national.
 "There is nothing sadder for the human heart," writes M. Nalbandyan, rather than seeing that a nation was falling և
perish under the harsh circumstances of another nationfrom oppression ”[1, 259].
  The syndrome of xenophobia, from ancient times to the present day, is manifested in the face of the Armenian ethnos և endangeredis the ethnic identity of the Armenians.
  Therefore, its scientific coverageIt is very urgent, especially from a political science point of view.
It has an early past stemming from the Aryan anthroposociogen of the Armenian peopleThe process of formation of ethnic identity, more than 5000 years.
In contrast to Western European countries, the nation in Armenian societypreceded the creation of the state.
The state (civil) identity of the Armenian people is not there yetto turn it into an ethnic identity, because the Armenians have been constantly depriveddoes not have a full state mentality.
 The Armenian ethnic borders do not coincide with the state ones.
  Nevertheless, ArmeniaThe name is derived from the Armenian ethnonym (self-name).
 By the way, Turkeythe current state borders are their racial-tribal territoriesThey are not.
 Centuries-old socio-cultural experience in its cradle, its own language,An Armenian with a letter has lost 90% of his territory.
 The Armenian who was expelled from his homeland due to the tragedy of the Genocide has spread to other parts of the worldto give birth to the "Armenian Diaspora" in the territories, to be cut off from the national cultural values ​​that preserve the Armenian identity.
Expanding during the 70 years of Soviet totalitarianismThe anti-national doctrine contributed to the xenophobia of the Armenians.
 Official:The ideology favored the all-Union interestfrom the collective logic of the Soviet people.
  The representative of Ethnos was considered a Soviet citizen of totalitarianism.
The language of interethnic communication, Russian, was privileged.which was considered a "second native language".
  The number of Armenian students in Russian schools in the republic was constantly increasing.
In the USSR, the national culture was ignored, a new united Soviet mentality and way of life was formed.
In a totalitarian society, it is purely national, without the SovietsIt was racist, xenophobic (Greek xenos foreign և phopos-early, xenophobia).
In the life of the Armenian people, because he did not have a state deedindependence, there was a hierarchical subordination to the radical nation.
At the same time, the ideal of the ethnic identity of the Armenian people in the Soviet country coincided in some respects with totalitarianism;to the existence of identity.
The country was dominated by internationalism, still the nations of Marxthe theory of rapprochement and then disappearance, which nationalism considered intolerable.
  National cultural valuesPraise was considered out of provincial thinking, smallracist concept of nations, self-defense movement.
The content of the culture was socialist, in essence, national.
  The individual gradually loses his traditional mental connection,with his native nation, he was denationalized և subjected to ethnic marginalization.
  Then there was a planned, latent assimilation of nations, nations, with the Russian people.
Issues related to the ethno-political sphere in the totalitarian country were covered in color, the supposed achievements of social-ethnic formations were drummed, the real picture of the national processes unfolding in the country was hidden.
1991 The totalitarian country collapsed on August 21, but the majority of the population of Armenia, including the political elite
Most of them have a Russian orientation.
  This is the reason for our republic's priority - to integrate into Russia,which, in turn, creates not so much trust of the West in Armenia towards the authorities.
The Russophilia of our people is proved by the fact that it is RussianThe factor played a crucial role in the fate of the Armenian people.
 300 yearsEarlier, the cornerstone of the Russian orientation was laid by Israel Ori.
Today, too, the political orientation has been put on real groundstate policy.
The interethnic conflict situation in the South Caucasus: the complicated Armenian-Turkish-Armenian-Azerbaijani relations;They made the integration of our republic with Russia imperative.
  RA:authorities recently agreed to join the Eurasian Economic Union, which will solve many socio-economic problems.questions.
"He is a factor contributing to the deepening of Armenian-Russian relations."The presence of 2.5 million Armenians in Russia, for whom favorable conditions have been createdsocio-environment for the development of national culture.
Under modern conditions, no country can ensure its comprehensivenessdevelopment without consolidation, especially the less powerful countries, such as:and Armenia!
  Thus, Armenia ranks 78th in the worldIt ranks 134th in terms of population, 125th in terms of GDP, and 84th in terms of living standards.
The motive contributing to xenophobia is mass emigration from the country, which is conditioned by legal-political, moral-psychological, socio-economic factors.
 The ranks of Diaspora Armenians (6 million)They are constantly replenished with immigrants.
  The main reason for migration is social tension.
 The Armenian, disappointed with the native authorities, being deprived of the right to live, leaves the homeland dissatisfied and humiliated.
 As much as G. Nzhdeh warns that "the homeland must
to love regardless of its political regime ”[3,32], yet sociallyThe defenseless individual is easily carried away by materialism, geopolitics և becomes an exile.
  In other words, the ethnonihilistor the ethnic marginal denies the mentality of its own community,regulates its behavior by transnational socio-cultural valuesfor material reasons.
National institutions: school, church, cultural centers,They are called to form an ethnic mentality with a common national idea, to inject the Armenian spirit, to save the Armenians from marginalization and assimilation.
 With effective connections of social institutions to Armenianscontributes to the optimal common field of coexistence in communitiesoperation.
Foreign immigration is stimulated by the immigration of Armenians from different parts of the world - repatriation.
  They bring foreigners with themsocio-cultural և different civilizational influences of countries.
It should be noted that the alien mentality has been formed over millennia.
 The Armenian people are a courageous, freedom-loving nationbut almost always there was no consolidation around the "common idea".
 A nation that will not be able to unite and govern itself,He is forced to obey a stranger.
The lack of a common racist concept or its anti-nationalism to some extent contributed to xenophobia.
The national ideology is an ethno-defense struggle to preservenational culture, language, religion, traditions, psychology,self-awareness.
  The national concept has mainly been developedAbroad, our national thinking was pushed forward in contradictionideas, because the Armenian had a marginal social status in foreign countries (foreign culture, language, way of life, etc.).
Some representatives of our ancient nation, statesmen, intellectuals, find it difficult to give up foreign interests.
  In the process of systemic changes, the ANM members do not havecomprehensive political doctrine of nation-state creation, devalued the national culture, which is called to support the national ideology.
 The political force that came to power claimed that in the conditions of geopolitics and democracy, national slogans seem to be impossible to unite the whole nation around a single ideology, moreover, "the national ideology was calleda false political category. "
  If in the conditions of totalitarianismfor the sake of "world" ների the ideas of "developed socialism" "ArmenianThe "figures" forgot the Armenian ideology, thennow liberal (liberal) և "globalist" figures of the Armenian peopleThey are pushing out of consciousness the possibility of a national ideologythe last vestiges of values ​​for their own self-interest [4,334], he writesis psychologist A. Nalchajyan.
The current ruling political elite wanted to make the national ideology an official concept, as Armenia is homogeneous in its national structure, so no matter how much people havedifferent political understandings, yet there is a common ethno-cultural ideal, without which the perspective of the nation is uncertain.
  It is an obvious fact that a sovereign, independent national state cannot be deprivedto be from a national ideology.
 The development of an ethno-political doctrine is necessary not only for multi-ethnic states, but also for mono-ethnic countries such as Armenia.
  The sectoral subculture of the Armenian nation is diverse, whichdemands to develop a sensible ethno-policy, otherwiseThe identity of the dispersed parts of the Armenian ethnos, no matter how foreign, will be endangered,In a multi-ethnic environment, ethnic unifying factors will be strongly expressed.
If the most advanced part of the Armenian social-political thought:St. Nazaryants, Gr. Artsruni and others were speaking in public
with the motto of Europeanizing life, then M. Nalbandyan saw the misery of the nation in foreignness.
Let's learn from strangers, but let's not inoculate Western valuesto our national structures, to "feed" from our own sources.
 "Woe to the tree, woe to the plant," writes the poet, "whose root is incapableto take from its bottom հատ to make its own juice… ”[5,56].
Today, the West with foreign, diverse supranational World ("monde-world)" ideas "," programs "," values ​​"It challenges our ethnic identity, our national coexistence.
  The hasty rooting of the educational and scientific models of the West, as well as the rooting of the credit educational program in the high school, without the creation of appropriate preconditions, cannotlead to positive results.
Western liberal values ​​do not harm the Armenian ethnic identity when they become a guide to coexistence"Institutions of traditional national-social relations" ամբողջական the complete national socio-cultural concept.
  He has become urgent. "Development of programs that ensure the continuity of education,which will not disrupt the national (Armenian) upbringing.
Tribal religion and Taronism complement each otherare historical-moral teachings, which are supreme valuesconsider the eternity of the tribe և the homeland, moreover, they have nothing in commonThey have nothing to do with foreign doctrines.
 Their mission is tribalPreservation of the Armenian identity through the rebirth and reform of values.
Thus, an Armenian with a natural desire to preserve his national identitypeople turned to nationalism, denied "Soviet people"preached the supranational ideology, reaffirmed the only Armenianideology.
Nationalism is a self-defense struggle against the alienideological influences, contributes to the consolidation of social-political forces.
  Xenophobia does not prefer the national factor, its supporters easily share powerwith foreigners չեն are not concerned about the nature of political borders.
Nationalism first of all refers to the nation and not to the state, so it is wrong to associate it with the state.
 Nationalism: Underestimation or neglect leads to cosmopolitanism, and overestimation leads to national pride and nationalism.
The Armenian is not very nationalistic, he criticized himself, he beat himself, but he respected others with foreignness, he took into account those living in his countrythe interests and rights of ethnic groups.
In Armenia, xenophobia towards foreigners is manifested at the level of xenophobia.
 It, in contrast to neighboring Georgia, is due to the ethnic homogeneity of the population, the demographic threat posed by national minorities, and national self-determination.in the absence of aspirations.
  Of course, there can be no question of inter-ethnic conflicts, it has been transferred to inter-ethnic ones(within the subneton) a range of contradictions.
 Ethnicity, as a political resource with unique socio-cultural spiritual features or components of identity, promotes state nation-building and deepens democratic processes, prevents disruptive traditions.xenophobia.
The era of ideologies is not over (nationalism, nationalism, racism, pan-Islamism, pan-Turkism,Zionism և etc.).
 The Armenian ideology is the driving force of all nationsunites the layers for the sake of national state interest, will prevent the formation of a foreign mentality.
 Otherwise a unique culture,The Armenian people with psychology are threatened by ethnic identitythe loss.
