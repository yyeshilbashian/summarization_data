There are noticeable sub-layers in the Gyumri-Leninakan-Gyumri dialectcompose և comprise many words transmitted from Eastern languages.
 It is known,that many words of the mentioned origin are communicated orallyThey first switched to a number of Armenian dialects, then to some of themIt has spread in the colloquial language, and a certain amount has passed to the literary language, it is recognized as a corresponding loan.
  Many foreign words are still actively used in dialects, as if foreign languages ​​next to their Armenian equivalents.
 These are considered unnecessary (14) or misappropriated (12) loans, but in oral language thinking, sometimes fictionThey have taken an irreplaceable place in the word, they still have it.
 LinguisticIn literature, two groups of loans are distinguished: literary-folk.
 are called verbal by the peopleloans that often reveal more than othersthe different influences of peoples on each other ևcan be a basis for assessing various domestic, cultural, historical, psychological realities and eventsև In matters of analysis.
  AR. Gharibyan writes. "Every dialect is a perfect linguistic system
is not inferior to the other. he is fit to express it to the people
or the reality and ideals of the part of the people for which he serves as speech, as language ”(7).
 It is known that in this perfect system not only very descriptive, but also the most variablePart of it is the vocabulary, which is always more subject to the influences of many linguistic and non-linguistic factors, to the penetration of foreign language words within that logic.
  Ed.Aghayan uses the words "borrowing" in the well-known work "Fundamentals of Linguistics".The term "impact" տարբեր distinguishes between different types of loans or impacts according to their "historical reasons";its role in the development of language ”(3).
  Within the logic of these observations, we refer to words in foreign languagespenetrations.
 We do not tend to address the issue of social diversity of Gyumri's dialect (it is the subject of another study), our goal is different during the historical developmentDue to the circumstances, the discovery of a huge number of foreign words (Eastern languages) that penetrated the Gyumri-Leninakan-Gyumri dialect ցուցադր is a display of the loans made.
 Գ. Jahukyan "Armenian
Introduction to Dialectology "writes in the study. The phonetic, grammatical and lexical features of the Armenian dialects have been formed throughout the history of the Armenian language - historical
depending on the conditions, getting stronger, weaker or eveninterrupting… ”(13).
Following the linguist throughout the development of the languageLet's discuss the question we are interested in the influence of different factorsin this context.
Arab, Turkish-Tatar, Persian more often unfriendly relations in the life of our people ալի catastrophic on languageThey left an impact.
 This is evident, first of all, when listing the verbal borrowings from those languages ​​incompletely.
  We are guided by dictionary data (6, 5, 10, 1), so from Arabic:isan, salamat, ghadr, ashap, / whether /, amanat / kept / / naghd, namus, ghalmaghal, amarat, akhmakh, munnat, mukhannat, gurban, tamam,bitun, alam, tomari, biradi, soap / soap, harif, haram, usul / canon,order /, mejli / h / s, ghayri / besides /, dovlat, ayib, ashgh / gusan /, ghsmat, khasiat / peculiarity /, khabar, hazar, lehef // b / blanket /, barakyat,ghalmaghal, ghalat, from the Iranian languages: jankar, outside (straight), zian/ damage /, tuman, lal / dumb /, laklak, zarbab, dice, lula / pipe /, gyuman,azar / pain /, which is used in pain and azar և zari (lament), which is usedis ah and zari with egg, babuj, mahana, janavar, kebab, armaghan, afarin / m,flan, flankyas, ama / but, but / և etc., from Turkish: dosh, top / ball /,damagh, sagh, kharchlykh / pocket money /, kh / ghavun / melon /, aslan,amag, alachai / colorful /, horror, chol, chakuj, ghapagh, bogaz, balki,adash, dushman, taza, thai, topal, khashlama, ghonagh, yavash, yorghan, janjal,քյոփակ, օյին, օյնբազ, դիլիմ, զոռբա և etc.
Of course, when presenting foreign words in the Gyumri-Leninakan-Gyumri dialect, we take the Shirak region into account to some extent, as the population movements, the language of the settlers, emigration-immigration, the post-earthquake situation have somehow eliminatedThe linguistic-dialectal borders of Gyumri և the surrounding villages are.
 This:The student youth of the region are especially important in this regardlinguistic contacts, then talking about the "pure" dialect of the cityWe are conditional.
It is noticeable that the older generation of villages is more inclined to thisThe older generation uses the same words as the younger generation.
  The middle generation compared to the elders:It is less commonly used in the East than in young peopleThe words passed from the languages ​​to the dialects, which, if we conditionally remove them from the language of communication, become noticeably open.
It is known that the Karno dialect is one of the largest dialects, աշխարհ its geographical distribution is increasing with the displacement caused by deportations.
 Communication is not only the cause of dialect-to-dialect transitions, but also of common dialect words, thatThey seem to breathe new life.
 It is clear that in the language of the deportees, foreign words have sometimes reached devastating proportions, often not even perceived as foreign languages.
 Moreover, even in their cradles, Armenians often became Turkish-speaking and Kurdish-speaking.
 About these sad facts H. Mesropyan writes. "The Armenians of Adana have become Turkish speakers,
although they have preserved many Armenian words in their language.
 Turkish:He also won in Malatya, Sebastia, Zara, Nicomedia,In Adabazar այլ other places inhabited by Armenians.
 Several Armenian-populated villages in Sasun managed to escape Turkish pogroms become Kurdish-speaking/ Arkhund և etc./ »(9).
Such a situation implies irreparable losses everywhereև In all areas.
We do not refer to words that have already passed the literary language, which are alreadyThese are changes, so to speak, they have received citizenship.
Add a few to the few examples above,whose borrowing language cannot be determined, for example, in Arabic,Persian /, growth / Arabic, Persian /, growth / Arabic, Persian /, anajal / Arabic,pers./, dalal / arab., pers. /, k / gholinj / arab., pers /, khayal / arab.,Persian /, Khazinay / Arabic, Persian /, Zapun / Arabic, Persian /, Layagh / Arabic,Persian /, Latifa / Arabic, Turkish /, ժ / զնճիլ / Turkish, Persian /, ayan / Arabic,Persian, Turkish /, Umud / Arabic, Persian, Turkish / և etc.
What does Hr. Acharyan of foreign words, mentioned mixed sources
about Which of the following languages ​​is actually a borrower? In fact, we are dealing directly with ուղղակի mediated borrowings.
  "The Armenian languageHistory ”in the work of Hr. Acharyan writes. "Arabic at that time (we are talking about the 10th century), as now, is all Muslim
It was the cultural language of the East. all our surrounding peoples / Persians,
Turks, Kurds, Tatars, Afghans, etc. / had made many loansfrom Arabic, և these loans were thus mixed with the native elementswith the fact that it was impossible to decide which was Arabic and which was foreign.
 We canto say that some international dictionary was compiled in the East, that dictionaryIt passed to the Armenians, if not completely, at least for the most part ”(2).
 In order to:If we imagine that size, it is enough to refer to it at the beginning of the 20th centuryExamples from the words used by the generations of the following decades (with pronunciation feature), և it will be clear what hitto obey the Armenian language by that "international dictionary".

Let us refer to a passage characterizing the language of this region from Atrpet."I mourn for you, Gyumri city, because I am well aware of your deeds. Your club is a gambler, the person in your midst is a thug… Your schools are not schools, your teachers will blow dust… Your doctors - a butcher, There is no account for mistakes… ".
 We do not touch upon other linguistic issues ուրիշ other foreign languages, we only consider the frequency of the words in question in a few lines, which was typical of the dialect of the time.
They are one of the elements typical of popular linguistic thinkingverbs, the presence of which in the dialect of Gyumri of the region under discussion is strictis underlined.
 Let us bring a few examples: aklamish eghni, ayan hanel, ajal come,to be stubborn, to be a bazaar, to be a bakla, to be stubborn, to be a bitmish,to stay awake, to be bushlamish, to keep a plant, b / p / ozmish to be, geltoz to be, gyarlamish to be, zay enel, zayla to take, tanazug enel, toortop ento see, to be there, to stay there, to be tallaf, to translate, to be tarif / f,tapa flies, / it will cause surprise /, to tap, to take dust, to give up,to lie down, to lie down, to lie down, to lie down, to lie down, to lie down, to lie down,to give, to put on yakhu, to eat, to eat, to eat, to eat, to eat, to eat, to eat, to eat, to eat, to eat, to eat, to eat, to eat, to eatto be clumsy, to be clumsy and grumpy (to waste in the sense), to be clumsy, to be a historianto pass, to be a puppet, to be a rad, to be a rast, to be a saber, to be a driver,to tie a knot, to have a tolashmish, to have a padlamish, to lose a pusule, a korlughto give, to be oyinlamish և etc.
Complications of different combinations of these words: և!duplicates, "constituents", etc., are also used with great frequency in speech, but fortunately in this caseThe tendency is obvious.
  There are words that are still used today. Let us refer to apal-tapal, ain-bey, alan-talan, avagh-savagh, alaimalay / all /, bazi-bazi, birdan bira (suddenly), dard and bala!davi-daraba, ghulughurban, yol and ghaida, shukhur-shamata, vara-yoga/ opportune-inappropriate /, jan u jigyar, kyosha-kyanar, kunjupuchakh, kor andregret և etc.
It should be noted that from the Turkish-Persian-Arabic languages ​​Hr. Acharyan said
is right that "it is not always possible to specify which language it is from" (2)Many of the words quoted above in the past as a result of generational changeDue to the circumstances, they left or almost leftFrom the speech of Gyumri, but also a considerable part, with its nominal valueIt is not used anymore, it is stylistically marked, and so onto survive in the language of the people of Gyumri.
 In the composition of phrases, other stable connections, proverbs, wise words, curses, blessings, these words are reinterpreted as folk pedagogy.component units are recorded, such as:enel, pilej enel (a part of it also has a direct meaning), eloghli-yaman oghli, berniazbar (does not mean "oral"), to murmur, which in this case does not mean the skin of an inexperienced person, also to be haram, to be halal(on the head), to tie a rope, not to touch the dust, to pull the backpack, to look like an old woman who hints at a non-positive feature (known, experienced).
The word "monkey" is used metaphorically with its various meanings: և!Expressing ugliness, "liveliness", a flattering attitude, "coffin" is not used to mean "shepherd's leather bag", but to express a negative attitude - "stomach"/ fill the coffin /, is used by the already young generation.
The words under discussion are, of course, used in other manifestations of popular thought.
They are more frequent in proverbs, less frequent in curses and blessingsthey are like cursing the evil devil, camphor eghnis, kispatd die, yurddbli, umudd die, bemuraz eghnis, ghurban eghni, ughuri be, he!If he goes, Ghaden will stay.
  "Zorbin has no border."
  "They came and saw, poor thingfukhara. They hit him on the head, they did it. "
  "Amanat will not be satisfied with a loaf of bread."
"Jigyar has no fighting."
 "Be gentle, be gentle."
 "Gel's cub tamazlghThere will be no (generation). "
 "Katil-katil gyol keghni" և etc.
Many words have become borrowed over time,often outdated, out of the ordinary, but being used in certain situations or continuing to be used, they remain a givenEvidence of the linguistic condition of the period.
  This is especially typical of fiction, in which words of this kind are endowed with the meaning of stylist և other (typification of the image, provision of color, etc.).
  In such applications, such loans are chosen, although there are Armenian equivalents next to them.
 Ս. Melkonyan said
writes. "There is a national equivalent of a foreign word, but the foreign word is used
from an individual-stylistic point of view ”(8).
 Stranger for special purposesto use words to memorize the word later through the written wordbecomes an occasion.
 It is enough to turn to one of the great Isahakyan's brave uses.
I loved it, they took me away.They got up and took him away."What kind of Zulu is this world?"They tore my heart and took it away (4).
It is known that when constructing a word, it acts with other circumstancesThe principle of verbal self-process.
 "Verbal self-process (automatism) is manifested as an aspiration to the use of ready-made language templates.
 The speaker does not make much effort to make a choice from the means of language; he constructs his speech using the already known and common formulations or referring to the forms chosen by the speaker, giving himself to the inertia of the speech he has constructed ”(11).
These are the very characteristics of speechto folk loans.
  Often to ensure the purpose, accuracy, and complete comprehension of the contentThe speaker refers to the subtlety of this or that word acquired by the society, without which (here is this usage) we can not get along.
 For example, the word "anguman" is used in such a subtle way, which in Persian means "doubt".is formed by the root, which means "opinion", but the public itperceives, as Hr. Acharyan (1), "Suddenly, the unexpected place"
in the sense in which it is often used, such asճար ».
  In the course of development, such subtleties have become synonymous,with different combinations of related words (moreover, foreign, Armenian), which emphasize, emphasize the reality, the feature, etc.as poor and selfish, do not see-gyormamish, luck and ghsmat, homeless-mirat,umud-guman, ar u amhot, ar u abur, jindar-jingana, և kefli-kefsiz,adat-bedat / is it adat for you, us bedat? / hah-nhhh / you are hah, you are nhhh /.
Such words և expressions, however, by the publicnot used evenly և not used.
  With the public class,social position, occupation, preferences, even verbalDepending on the situation, the frequency of use of these words is very different. There seems to be no or almost no tendency for new horses
to enter the share created by the mood of the days /, and in general, the languageAlong with the development, the influence of the Eastern Oral Dictionary on the dialect of Gyumri objectively decreased.
 Completely or almost completely obvious foreign words, forms and structures have come out,such as khorozlamish, meymunlamish, ustabashi / master /, azabbashi, parbashi, oynbaz / joker /, khumarbaz, qayandarbaz, umudziz, kefs, frsands, pehlu, kefli, kirachi, phaetonchi, chalghichi, prnchi,khelarlama, gyurlama, khashlama, bughlama, beabur, bedolvat, bedamagh,նաճար / նա- կըգըմա, նա- կէղըմա / և etc.
  Language by the law of self-purificationgets rid of unfamiliar elements, but there are words and phrases thatThey do not even seem to be perceived as foreign'shave been used with equal right in the dialect of Gyumri (միայն not only Gyumri), such as kyasa, kyasib, chiblakh, table, ghaba / speak /, lmbuk / water /, zahla, hakh, hakhitsal, korizan, zabun, epeja, amag, alamat, ayan, anjigar, munnat, mahana, kebab, tamam, taza, topal, zorba, durgyar,ջանդամ, ջանդըմել, յանի, մայլա, քյամար, թրիոս, շար, wordsMuzhda և etc.
сохраняются в языковом мышлении народа.
