Gyumri - Leninakan - The dialect of Gyumri forms a noticeable sublayer երտ consists of many words transmitted from the Eastern languages.
 It is known that many words of the mentioned origin first passed through oral communication to a number of Armenian dialects, then some of them spread in the colloquial language, and a certain number passed to the literary language, it is recognized as a corresponding borrowing.
  Many foreign words are still actively used in dialects, as if foreign languages ​​next to their Armenian equivalents.
 They are considered unnecessary (14) or misused (12) loans, but in oral language thinking, sometimes in fiction, they have taken an irreplaceable place and still do.
 In linguistic literature, two groups of loans are distinguished: literary-folk.
 The verbal borrowings made by the people are called popular, which often, more than others, reveal the various influences of the peoples on each other և can be the basis for the analysis of various events of everyday life, culture, history, psychology.
  AR. Gharibyan writes. "Every dialect is not inferior to any other's perfect language system. it is convenient to express the reality and ideals of the part of the people's people for which it serves as speech, as language ”(7).
 It is known that in this perfect system, not only the most descriptive, but also the most variable part is the vocabulary, which is always և more subject to the influences of many linguistic-extralinguistic factors և within that logic, to the penetrations of foreign language words.
  In the well-known work "Fundamentals of Linguistics", Ed. Aghayan uses the terms "borrowing", "influence", and's distinguishing different types of borrowings or influences according to their "role in the development of language for historical reasons" (3).
  Within the framework of the logic of these observations, we refer to the penetrations of words in foreign languages.
 We do not intend to address the issue of social diversity of Gyumri's dialect (it is the subject of another study), our goal is to reveal the huge number of foreign words (Eastern languages) that have penetrated the Gyumri-Leninakan-Gyumri dialect due to various circumstances during historical development.
 Գ. Jahukyan writes in the "Introduction to Armenian Dialectology" study. "The phonetic, grammatical and lexical features of the Armenian dialects have been formed throughout the history of the Armenian language, strengthening, weakening or even interrupting։ depending on the given historical conditions" (13).
Following the linguist's idea of ​​the influence of various factors during the whole period of language development, we will discuss the issue we are interested in in this context.
The more often unfriendly relations between the Arab, Turkish-Tatar and Persian countries have left a catastrophic effect on the language in the life of our people.
 This is evident, first of all, when listing the verbal borrowings from those languages ​​incompletely.
  We are guided by the data of dictionaries (6, 5, 10, 1), so from Arabic: isan, salamat, ghadr, ashap, / whether /, amanat / kept / / naghd, namus, ghalmaghal, amarat, akhmakh, munnat, mukhannat, ghurban, tamam, bitun, alam, tomari, biradi, sapon / sabon, harif, haram, usul / kanun, karg /, mejli / h / s, ghayri / bes /, dovlat, ayib, ashigh / gusan /, ghsmat , character / feature /, khabar, hazar, lehef // b / blanket /, barakyat, ghalmaghal, ghalat, from the Iranian languages: zankar, drest / straight /, zian / damage /, tuman, lal / dumb /, laklak, zarbab, dice, lula / tube /, gyum, azar / pain /, which is used with pain and azar և zari / mourning /, which is used with ah and zari egg, babuj, mahana, janavar, kebab, armaghan, afarin / m, filan, flankyas, ama / but, but / և etc., from Turkish: dosh, top / ball /, damagh, sagh, kharchlykh / pocket money /, kh / ghavun / melon /, aslan, amag,alachai / colorful /, horror, chol, chakuj, ghapagh, bogaz, balki, adash, dushman, taza, tay, topal, khashlama, ghonagh, yavash, yorghan, janjal, kyopak, oin, oinbaz, dilim, etc.
Of course, when presenting foreign words in the Gyumri-Leninakan-Gyumri dialect, we take into account the Shirak region in general, as the population movements, the language of the settlers, emigration-immigration, the post-earthquake situation somehow eliminate the linguistic-dialectal borders of Gyumri և surrounding villages.
 The linguistic contacts of the student youth of the region are especially important in this issue, so let's talk about the "pure" dialect of the city conditionally.
It is noticeable that the older generation of the villages is more inclined to use these words, the older generation also uses them, unlike the young ones.
  The middle generation, compared to the elders, is less frequent, compared to the younger ones, the words passed from the languages ​​of the East are often used, which, if we conditionally remove them from the language of communication, becomes noticeably open.
It is known that the Karno dialect is one of the largest dialects, աշխարհ its geographical distribution is increasing with the displacement caused by deportations.
 Communication not only causes the transition from dialect to dialect, but also to the common dialect words, in addition, they give a new breath.
 It is clear that in the language of the deportees, foreign words have sometimes reached devastating proportions, often not even perceived as foreign languages.
 Moreover, even in their cradles, Armenians often became Turkish-speaking and Kurdish-speaking.
 About these sad facts H. Mesropyan writes. "The Armenians of Adana have become Turkish speakers, although they have preserved many Armenian words in their language.
 Turkish also won in Malatya, Sebastia, Zara, Nicomedia, Adabazar and other Armenian-populated areas.
 Several Armenian-populated villages in Sassoun, which managed to escape the Turkish massacres, became Kurdish-speaking (Arkhund, etc.) ”(9).
Such a situation implies irreversible losses everywhere in all spheres.
We do not refer to the words that have passed into the literary language, which are already changes և, so to speak, have acquired citizenship.
To the few examples given above, let us add a few whose borrowing language cannot be determined, for example: ar / arabic, persian, ascham / arabic, persian /, ashayip / arabic, persian /, anajal / arabic, persian ./, դալալ / արաբ., պարսկ. /, կ / ղոլինջ / արաբ., պարսկ /, խայալ /աբար., պարսկ/, խազինայ / արաբ., պարսկ /, զապուն / արաբ., պարսկ /, լայաղ / արաբ. , Persian /, Latifa / Arabic, Turkish /, ժ / զնճիլ / Turkish., Persian /, Ayan / Arabic, Persian, Turkish /, Umud / Arabic, Persian, Turkish / և etc.
What does Hr. Acharyan about foreign words, mentioned mixed sources. Which of the following languages ​​is actually a borrower? In fact, we are dealing directly with ուղղակի mediated borrowings.
  In the work "Armenian Linguistics" Hr. Acharyan writes. "Arabic at that time (we are talking about the 10th centuries) was, as it is now, the cultural language of the entire Muslim East. All the peoples around us (Persians, Turks, Kurds, Tatars, Afghans, etc.) borrowed a lot from the Arabic language, և these loans were so mixed with the native elements that it was impossible to decide which was Arab and which was foreign.
 We can say that some international dictionaries were compiled in the East, and that dictionary passed to the Armenians, if not completely, at least in part ”(2).
 In order to imagine this size, it is enough to refer to examples from the words used by the generations of the beginning of the 20th century (in the following decades) (with pronunciation feature), և it will become clear how the Armenian language was hit by that "international dictionary".

Let us quote a passage from Atrpet describing the language of this region: “I mourn for you, city of Gyumri, because I am well aware of your deeds. Your club is a gambler, the person in your midst is a thug… Your schools are not schools, your teachers will blow dust… Your doctors - a butcher, There is no account for mistakes… ".
 We do not touch upon other linguistic issues ուրիշ other foreign languages, we only consider the frequency of the words in question in a few lines, which was typical of the dialect of the time.
One of the elements typical of the folk language thinking is the adverbs, the existence of which is strongly emphasized in the dialect of Gyumri of the discussed region.
 Let us bring a few examples: aklamish eghni, ayan hanel, ajal come, beylu be, bazar entel, bakla-enel, ytin yngnel (stubborn), bitmish beghn, bedamagh mna, bughlamish enel, bush ozmish enel, geltoz enel, gyarlamish eghnel, zay enel, zayla tanel, tanazug enel, torortop enel, tadaruktesnel to cause /, to bite, to take dust, to give up, to give up, to lie down, to lie down, to lie down, to break down, to lie down, to lie down, to lie down, to lie down, to lie down, to lie down, to lie down, to lie down, to lie down չաբալամիշ էղնել, չալրմիշ էղնէլ, չուր եւ ղուր էնել (մսխել again) to be և etc.
Complications with different combinations of these words - "repetitive", "compound", etc., have also been used very often in the speech, but fortunately in this case the reduction of this is obvious.
  There are words that are still used today. Let us refer to apal-tapal, ain-bey, alan-talan, avagh-savagh, alaimalay / all /, bazi-bazi, birdan bira / suddenly /, dard and bala, davi-daraba, gulughurban, yol and ghaida, shukhur -shamata, vara-yoga / opportune-inappropriate /, jan u jigyar, kyosha-kyanar, kunjupuchakh, kor uposhman և etc.
It should be noted that from the Turkish-Persian-Arabic languages ​​Hr. Acharyan is right that "it is not possible to find out every time what language he is from" (2). Many of the words quoted above, due to generational change, have come out or almost gone out of Gyumri's dialect, but a considerable part is due to its nominal value. It is not used, it is stylistically marked, thus it continues to exist in the language of the people of Gyumri.
 Rethinking the meaning of phrases, other stable connections, proverbs, wise verses, curses, and blessings, these words are recorded as components of folk pedagogy, such as to have the bell ringing, to shake, to shake (some of which also have a straightforward meaning). , Berniazbar (does not mean "oral"), to snort, which in this case does not mean the skin done by an inexperienced person, also to be haram eghni, halal eghni / head /, to tie a ram, not to bite the dust, to pull the scabbard, not to grow old hints at a positive feature (known, experienced).
The word "monkey" is used metaphorically to express "ugliness", "liveliness", "affection", "cattle" is not used to mean "shepherd's leather bag", but to express a negative attitude - "stomach" / cattle to fill /, is used or not by the younger generation.
The words under discussion are, of course, used in other manifestations of popular thought.
In proverbs, more often, in curses ոչ in blessings, infrequent things, such as the evil devil shouts, camphor eghnis, kispatd die, yurddbli, umudd dies, bemuraz eghnis, ghurban eghni, ughur ogni, he «" Orkerta, ghad.
  "Zorbin has no border."
  "They came and saw, poor thing. They hit him on the head, they did it. "
  "Amanat will not be satisfied with a loaf of bread."
"Jigyar has no fighting."
 "Be gentle, be gentle."
 "The baby of the gel will not be tamazlgh (generational)."
 "Katil-katil gyol keghni" և etc.
Many words have become borrowed over time, often outdated, out of the ordinary, but being used or continuing to be used in certain situations remain evidence of the linguistic state of the time.
  This is especially typical of fiction, in which words of this kind are endowed with the meaning of stylist և other (typification of the image, provision of color, etc.).
  In such applications, such loans are chosen, although there are Armenian equivalents next to them.
 Ս. Melkonyan writes. "There is a national equivalent of a foreign word, but the foreign word is used in a personal-stylistic sense" (8).
 Turning to foreign words for a specific purpose later becomes a means of preserving the word through the written word.
 It is enough to turn to one of the great Isahakyan's brave uses.
I loved, they took me away. They gave me up and took me away. - What kind of world is this? They tore my heart and took it away (4).
It is well-known that when constructing speech, the principle of eloquent self-efficacy works with other circumstances.
 "Verbal self-process (automatism) is manifested as an aspiration to the use of ready-made language templates.
 The speaker does not make much effort to make a choice from the means of language; he constructs his speech using the already known and common formulations or referring to the forms chosen by the speaker, giving himself to the inertia of the speech he has constructed ”(11).
These very characteristic features of speech refer to popular loans.
  Often the speaker, in order to ensure the purpose, accuracy, and complete comprehension of the content, turns to the subtlety acquired by the public for this or that word, without which (here is this usage) we can not get along.
 For example, the word "anguman" is used with such a meaning, which is formed from the Persian root "doubt", which means "opinion", but the public perceives it, as Hr. Acharyan (1), in the sense of "suddenly, unexpected place", which is often used as "light from place to place".
  During the development, such subtleties were formed with different combinations of synonymous, related, antonym words (by the way, "foreign," in Armenian), which emphasize, emphasize the reality, the feature, etc., such as poor and selfish, do not see-gormamish, luck and ghsmat , anter-mirat, umud-guman, ar u amot, ar u abur, jindar-jingana! You, nhakh /.
Such words և expressions, however, have not been used equally by the public և are not used.
  The frequency of use of these words is very different due to social class, social status, occupation, preferences, and verbal condition. There seems to be no or almost no tendency of new horses (to enter a share created by the mood of the day), and in general, along with the development of language, the influence of the Eastern oral dictionary on the dialect of Gyumri has objectively decreased.
 Completely or almost completely, other foreign words, forms and structures, such as khorozlamish, meymunlamish, ustabashi / master /, azabbashi, parbashi, oynbaz / joker /, khumarbaz, qandarbaz, umfuzs, f. , kefli, kirachi, phaytonchi, chalghichi, pnrchi, khelarlama, gyurlama, khashlama, bughlama, beabur, bedolvat, bedamagh, nachar / na-kigma, na-kighma / և etc.
  The language is freed from unfamiliar elements by the law of self-purification, but there are words and sounds that do not seem to be perceived as foreign և still continue to be used with equal right in the dialect of Gyumri (միայն not only Gyumri), such as kyasa, kyasib, chiblakh, tableb, ghbab / / water /, zahla, hakh, hakhits gal, korizan, zabun, epeja, amag, alamat, ayan, anjigar, munnat, mahana, kebab, tamam, taza, topal, zorba, durgyar, jandam, jandemel, yan, m , font
сохраняются в языковом мышлении народа.
