1. Preface.
  Passing to the twelve-year educational system, there were some changes in the curriculum of different subjects in the school course. New sections were added, or the material provided in the existing sections became more comprehensive.
 In particular, a new paragraph was added to the "Elements of Logic" chapter in the 11th grade natural science and mathematics flow algebra school course: "Proof քում refutation.
 The main methods of proof ման "refutation", which speaks about different methods of proof: comparison, contradictory assumption, Dirichlet principle, exclusion, copy.
 We think it would be desirable to talk about the invariant in the same paragraph, because in school classes in mathematics and physics, as well as in different stages of school Olympiads, there are problems that require students not only knowledge of theoretical material, but also different methods and tricks.
 One such method is the invariant method.
 The latter can be considered a method based on Poya's well-known observation, according to which every trick that can be used in one-to-one cases can be considered a method  1.
This work is devoted to revealing the possible uses of invariant in solving various atypical problems in school mathematics and physics classes.
 In fact, the novelty of the work is that we have tried to clearly distinguish two "types" of the invariant, namely, the existing invariant և looking invariant, which are found in various non-typical problems of mathematics and physics, as we have suggested methodological instructions for different types of invariant in problems և about the possibilities of using the latter.
We think that the topic is quite topical, as the analysis of the results of the Republican Mathematics Olympiad in Physics and Mathematics shows that a significant number of students find it difficult to solve problems related to different variants.
 This is mainly due to the fact that students are either not familiar with this method at all, or, being formally familiar with the proposed method, do not underestimate the possibility and effectiveness of its use and try to solve problems without invariant.
2. "Varieties" of Invariant.
 How do we know that a quantity with respect to a change is called an invariant if the latter remains unchanged during the change տվյալ տվյալ2.
In various problems of mathematics and physics, sometimes there are quantities (or properties of quantities) that remain unchanged in the given problem - invariant, in general, the invariantness of these quantities is conditioned not by any law of conservation or some theorem, but by the given problem. or under initial conditions.
  In some cases, the use of such invariant becomes necessary when solving decisive problems.
For a student who is new to this method, at first glance it may seem very surprising how the enviriant can become an effective, useful "tool" in solving various problems.
 In fact, the main difficulty is that in each specific problem it is not clear from the beginning whether this method is applicable to it or not. What is the role of invariant in it?
 Money, in addition to being formally acquainted with this method, has a certain skill, ability ևexperience in solving necessary ethological problems.
As mentioned above, in many problems there are quantities or properties of different quantities, which, depending on the position of the problem or the initial conditions, remain unchanged - invariant.
 Accordingly, let us distinguish two "different types" of invariant, that is, existing և wanted.
 Let us agree: • if in the initial conditions of the problem it is explicitly or not revealed that any quantity (or any property of the latter) is unchanged, then we consider the given quantity invariant in the conditions of the problem under consideration; However, after some changes or logical judgments, it is possible to find one that is considered invariant in the conditions under which the invariant is sought.
3. Methodical instructions և problem series.
 We think that it is desirable to first discuss with students who are familiar with the essence of the invariant such problems, in which there is a certain unchanging quantity from the beginning, and only then to discuss problems in which there is a need to look for the canine.
 Moreover, it is not superfluous to mention that if you manage to find an invariant (existing or wanted) in the problem, you should try to use it directly during the solution of the given problem.
In this context, let us discuss some non-typical problems, during the solution of which we will use either the fact of the existence of an existing or a sought-after invariant and its direct application.
Problem 1.
 Three-pole contour made of flexible wire, the resistance of which is kaOm on my side.
  Contour in a homogeneous magnetic field with local induction so that the plane of the contour is perpendicular to the magnetic induction vector.
What charge will flow through the contour if we give it an equilateral triangle, leaving it in the same plane?
  3 Solution.
 It is easy to notice that in this problem we are dealing with an existing (derived from problem point data) invariant. It is obvious that no matter how we look at the flexible cable, its length will remain constant.
 Therefore, after changing the contour egg, we get from the equation of the perimeters of a square with a regular triangle's side b and the sides a:
, from which for the initial և values ​​of the contour of the contour magnetic field we will get:
.
 On the other hand, according to Faraday և Ohm's laws, the ELSHU ​​in the contour, from which it is derived.
Note that the problem can be generalized to consider arbitrary regular polygonal or circular contours.
Problem 2.
  The number of absentees in the class is 1/6 of the number of those present.
  After one student left the classroom, the number of absentees was 1/5 of the number of those present.
Find out how many students study in the given class.
 4 Solution.
 It is clear that this problem can be easily solved by introducing a variable and forming a corresponding equation for the latter.
 But we will behave differently.
Although the question does not explicitly state that the magnitude is unchanged, it is easy to see that, given the nature of the problem, we are dealing with a (non-obvious) invariant, that is, the total number of students in that class.
  Let's try to estimate the number of absences of those present both at the beginning and at the end according to this existing invariant.
 Since in the beginning the number of absentees was 6 times smaller than the number of those present, it would mean that the absentees made up 1/7 of the number of all the students in the class.
 In the same way, when one student leaves the classroom, the absences will make up 1/6 of the total number of students in the class, which means that one student makes up one-half of the total number of students in the class, so there are 42 students in the class.
Let us now discuss problems in which there is no invariant arising from the initial data of the problem from the beginning, but with the "logical judgments" of the analysis of the problem it is possible to "search" and find such a quantity and use the latter to solve the problem.
The hermetically sealed bowl is completely filled with water so that there are two identical air bubbles on its bottom.
 The pressure at the bottom of the pot is MPa.
 What will be the pressure on the floor if one of the bubbles rises and the other stays on the bottom of the bowl?
  5 Problem 3.
Solution.
  Let us denote the initial volumes of the bubbles by 0 V, 1 V, and denote the volume of the bubble rising after the process by 2 V.
 It is clear that the water in the bowl can be considered a thermostat for the rest of the bubbles.
  According to that, the temperature of the air in the bubbles "at the beginning of the process" is the same as the temperature of the water.
  According to the condition of the problem, the vessel is hermetically sealed, therefore we can conclude that the volume of the system does not change.
 Since water is incompressible, the sum of the volumes of the bubbles must remain constant.
 In fact, the searchable invariant is the sum of the bubbles at the end of the process.
If we set the pressure at the bottom of the bowl to P at the end of the process, according to Boyle-Marriott's law we will have:
Given that 1V and 2 V are invariant of the sum of the latter, we will finally get:
 Excluding MPa from these equations.
Problem 4.
  F moves the wedge A and the rod B in horizontal horizontal force.
 The angle of the septum is,, the masses of the septum are m (see Fig. 1).
 Find the acceleration of the wedge - the force of the wedge-rod interaction, if there is no contact.
  5 Solution.
 It is easy to notice that the wedge rod.
 The horizontal ratio of the wedge ողջ during the movement of the wedge rod to the vertical component of the resistance force և gm
movements are interconnected. At any time t, if the wedge moves by x, the rod will rise աչափ so it is a variant.
 Therefore, we can argue that the ratio of the displacements of the rod և wedge ցանկացած at any given time is a constant value և equal to  the tangent of the angle.
 It is clear that such a connection also exists at any given time between the instantaneous velocities and accelerations of those bodies, that is.
 The upward acceleration of the rod Ba is due to the wedge moving N

 Solving the component of the obtained equations:

order, we will get: Problem 5.
 The given line AB is marked with an arbitrary number of 45 different points that do not belong to 
AB section.
  Prove that the sum of the distances from point A of all these points cannot be equal to the sum of the distances from point B.
  6 Solution.
  Let the length of segment AB be a.
  Note that arbitrary M  ող does not belong to the segment AB, but belongs to the line AB, so in the conditions of this problem MA MB
for item MA MB:
The magnitude is invariant, whatever the 45 different points given backwards are, the sum of the distances from point A to տարբեր the difference between the sum of the distances from point B is a sum of 45 summands, which, of course, is different from zero, so the sums are not equal.
Note that the problem can be generalized արկել consider the desired number of odd points և the same length, the desired number of odd numbers.
Problem 6.
  Is it possible to arrange 77 3x3x1 bricks in a 7x9x11 box?
  6 Solution.
  Suppose it is possible.
  In that case, consider the layer 1 thickness adjacent to the 7 x11 session of the box.
 It is clear that some of the given bricks will either be completely in that layer, that is, they will occupy nine 1x1x1 size cubes in that layer, or they will occupy three 1x1x1 size cubes in that layer. cubes, which is not possible because 7 11 77 3
It is not possible to completely fill a 7x9x11 box with 77 bricks of 3x3x1 size.
Let us add that there are also problems in which it is not the specific quantity or any property of the quantity that remains invariant, but the dynamics of the change of the variable quantity that remains invariant, that is, the variable quantity either increases or decreases during its change. That is to say, the changing magnitude is changed by monotone.
 As a vivid example of this, let us consider the following issue, which was raised at the 1986 International School Mathematics Olympiad.
Problem 7.
    Some integers are written on each vertex of a regular pentagon so that at least one of them is negative, but the sum of all is positive.
  The following change is allowed ․ if any of the three vertices are written corresponding to y , then those numbers can be substituted և z
with numbers y, and the change is correspondingly charged as long as there is a negative integer at the vertex of any pentagon.
  To find out whether this process can be completed after the final steps or it is possible to continue it indefinitely.
; xy և z numbers, including x yzt և u integers, moreover:
Solution.
 Consider the first written 0 y ներում on the vertices of the pentagon.
According to the condition of the problem, let's count the whole number by five.
 Note that we have the current invariant, that is, the sum of the numbers written in the vertices of the pentagon. Indeed, let us enter the number determined by the numbers at the vertices of the pentagon.
When replacing the current step with a quintuplet, the variable, each, gets a variable such that 0 F
.
 Thus, we have the variable F, which always accepts all positive values ​​when changing the quintuplets ոն the monotone decreases throughout the process, then we can conclude that the process described above will naturally end after the final steps.
 It is really easy to notice that.
  Let's prove the quatrain 4. Conclusion.
  In conclusion, invariant has a useful և application in problems where • we are dealing with a specific or existing invariant quantity (such as the length of the circle in Problem 1 or the total number of students in Problem 2), • it is invariant What remains is not a single specific quantity, but some combination of variables: sum, difference, coefficient. Yield (such as the sum of the bubble volumes in Problem 3, the ratio of the four-wedge acceleration modules in Problem 4, or MA MB in Problem 5).
  modulus of differences in lengths), • a property of variable magnitude remains invariant: evenness, multiplicity, etc. (such as multiplying the number of cubes of units of size 3 in Problem 6), • the dynamics of change of variable magnitude remains invariant; Any quantity that changes during the whole process described in the question either only increases or only decreases (such as the fact that the variable F decreases in Problem 7).
