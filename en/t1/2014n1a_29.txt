We have tried to isolate and justify such risksExistence, such as the increase of the poverty level, the increase of the expenditure burden of the state budget, the imperfection of the mechanisms of accumulation of funds։ further distribution և the possible outflow of capital from the Republic of Armenia.
 We are not against the funded pension system in principle, we think that the introduction of the system is premature,As the above-mentioned risks have not been assessed at the level of scientific research so far, moreover, many studies prove the imperfection of the system, which in turn suggests that the smooth operation of the system is highly questionable.
 It is necessaryNote that the introduction of the funded pension system is mainlyhas been successful in countries with developed economies where it existshigh standard of living of the population.
Mandatory funded pension system in Armenia includes able-bodied 15-40-year-olds with employmentthe part of the population that is actually registered as relevantIn enterprises, institutions, it allocates a certain amount of its salary to the funded pension funds, with the expectation that after retiring, in addition to the pension provided to it by the state, it will receive an additional accumulated pension amount.
  Although the law on funded pensions was adopted in our country in 2010, և since 2011The voluntary pension component was active, but in fact it isOne of them did not transfer money voluntarily to the accumulative funds.
 That institute has not been established in our republic for three years.
There are several reasons, the following can be distinguished:distrust of the people towards that system, low income and salary of a significant part of the able-bodied populationlevel.
According to the RA Law on Funded Pensions, in 2014The mandatory funded component will come into force on January 1, 2010of which in 1974 Every salaried employee born after January 1, 2010 is obliged to accumulate 5% of his / her nominal monthly salary by transferring it to the pension funds.
 The mandatory component will refer to 270 thousand 15-40 year old able-bodied people in Armeniapopulation.
  2012 year. According to current data, 15-40 in our republic
The annual population is 1388.9 thousand. (679.9 thousand - men, 709 thousand - women) [1, page 43].
 That is, the pension fund does not need moneytransfer 1118.9 thousand a person who makes up a given age group
80.6% of the population, which is quite a high index.
  Their significantThe sector is rural residents, the unemployed, those who go out for seasonal work, and the workers are in the shadows.
In this regard, approximately half a million 15-40 year oldsThey will not objectively pay to the accumulative fund.
 It should be noted that the number of people paying to the fund of the villagers is about 770a thousand people.
 The figures show that the population is 618.9 thousandMost of them are serving in the army, the other part is for seasonal work or has gone to other countries permanently, the unemployed are employed in the shadow economy.
 Based on the above calculationsThe following key question can be asked: to what extent will the system solve the problem of welfare, if at the present stage only 20% of the citizens aged 15-40, according to approximate estimates, will take part in it?and the remaining 80% will not use the high provided by the systemfrom pensions.
Now let's present the countries mentioned by the RA Government as experience of the funded pension system: Chile, Peruսոցի Several socio-economic և demographic indicators of Estonia.
Let us state that they are nations formed in different environments compared to the Republic of Armenia, which differ from each other in religion, history,Ethnic psychology, material and spiritual values, work culture, geopolitical concepts.
 In other words, what is Armenia?has nothing in common with those countries.
 In addition, the countries listedare at a higher level of socio-economic development,than our republic.
 The demographic conditions presented in Table 1 are also different.

   In compiling the table, we used the statistics of the listed countriesyearbooks.
Table 1 shows the per capita gross outputArmenia is in the last place by volume.
  In addition, in those countriesThe average monthly salary fluctuates in the range of 1000-2000 dollars, and in our country it does not exceed 300.
  The figures show thatthat our republic has nothing in common with socio-economicwith those countries.
 And that fact can be taken into account when:There is a transition to the funded pension system.
When moving to a funded pension systemalso the forecast of population change in the next 15-20 years.
  Given this provision, we have tried to predict whetherTen years later, what can be changed about the population of our republic, the age composition?
 What was the demographic picture of the Republic of Armenia in the past, now?և What it might be like in the future is shown in Table 2.
The trend of the population composition and age structure of the Republic of Armenia 1979-2025 / thousand people /
Table 2:19791989200120112025peoplepeoplepeoplepeoplepeopleAll:population:Includingup to 15year:65 և:high:The table shows that in the age structure of the population of our republic during the last 35 years, in particularQualitative and quantitative changes have taken place since the 1990s.
  The share of the working age population աշխատ absolute number բնակ of the retirement age և has gradually increased, and untilOn the contrary, the working age has decreased.
 That is thatDuring the years there was an aging population բնակ retireesincrease in number.
 Without delving into the emergence of such demographic conditions, let us mention that one of the main reasons for the decrease in the number of birthsIt is the mass emigration of the population that started at the end of the 20th century.
  And according to our approximate calculation, in 2025 in our republic
Half of the population will be able-bodied, and 1/4 -pensioners.
 Note that in 2015 in the period after
The share of retirees will continue to rise, and 40annual mandatory funded pension payers themselveswill receive a pension (in case of not raising the retirement age)Since 2037.
 If the current demographic tendencies are maintained in the mentioned year, then more than 1/3 of the population of our republic or around500 thousand will be the pensioners.
      Let's do the same with the funded pension systemcertain quantitative analyzes և forecasts.
  2013 In January-October, according to the NSS [2], the average in Armenia
The nominal salary was 146,952 AMD.
 If we accept thisas a basis for our further calculations, then mandatory accumulativeThe payment for this salary will be 7348 drams, and the incometax / 36228 AMD / հետո after withholding the mandatory accumulative paymentThe real disposable income will make 103317 drams.
 Actually mandatorythe component is actually the net average left after taxation6.63% of the salary.
 This number varies depending on the estimated salary, և can reach up to 13%, but it is alwaysmore than 5%, which distorts the economic content of the mandatory component, as in fact the participant accumulativehe makes a contribution for his taxable, that is, unmanaged income.
The number of economically active population of the Republic of Armenia in 2012 The average was 1418.3 thousand people, of which 663.2 thousand are employees.
 By:According to preliminary forecasts, it will become about 270,000 employeesare participants of the mandatory funded component.
 According to the calculation of the average salary, as we have already mentioned above, the accumulative payment is:It means 7348 drams, which means that it is rented to pension fundsThe payment made by the employees next year will be not less than 23 807,5 million drams.
 In fact, this amount will be a little more than 500,000In the amount of more than 5% of the payment of the participants of the mandatory funded system receiving salaries, paid from their calculated incomes.
RA 2013 directed to social protection in the state budget
The expenses were 304696.8 million drams, and in 2014 in the state budget
It is planned to increase the means directed to social protection:up to 362030.6 million drams.
 An additional 20 billion is planned to be accumulatedfor the introduction of the pension system, and the remaining amount,in fact, it is the amount with which the state allocatesto make pension funds in parallel with the payments of the population.
In fact, mandatory retirement in the coming yearsThe payments will become an additional burden not only for the hired workers, but also for the state budget.
 Moreover, the state budgetIn this case, these costs will increase year by year, as the number of employees born after January 1, 1974 will increase year by year:In connection with the transfer of young people to hired work.
 1974 Those born after January 1 are citizens aged 0-40.
 If:take into account that persons are able to work in the manner prescribed by lawFrom the age of 15, we can state that the current allocations of about 25 billion drams are made for 16-40 year olds.that is, for a total of about 25 different age groups.
 Thus, we can state that the number of employees will increase every yearIn one age group, that is, on average, there will be an increase in the number of participants in the mandatory funded component by 1/25 of their total number.։ At the same time, budget expenditures will increase by the same proportion, by about 1/25 of the current expenditures.
 That means everyoneThis year, the budget expenditure item will increase by about 1 billion drams և 25In a year it will make almost 50 billion drams a year.
  This number is RA 2013. It is about 5% of the state budget, it is enough to understand what kind of expenditure burden the mandatory accumulative system will become for the state budget.
It should be noted, however, that during this whole period, ie in the next 25 years, the state budget expenditures on pension payments will not decrease, on the contrary, according to the governmentAccording to the data provided, the birth rate in the 50s will increaseAs a result of the sharp increase in the number of retirees in the coming yearsպատճառով due to the increase in life expectancy [3].
 That is, the state budgetThe social burden will be eased only after 25 years, when it is mandatoryThe first participants of the funded system will start receiving their multi-level pensions.
 In the following years, only pension budget allocations for these age groupsThe sums will continue to decrease.
Taking into account the above calculations made by us ևThe expected annual increases in the allocations from the state budget to the pension funds raise the question of how timely they are.Adoption of the mentioned law և application, when, for example, in 2014 state budget
The project envisages a deficit of 110,534,580.0 drams, and a state deficitAbout 29.2% of the budget expenditures are planned to be directed to social protection expenditures / 364,361,632.5 AMD 1,246,437,412. of total expenses / [4].
We think of the consequences of the transition to funded pensionsOne could be the increase in poverty due to reduced consumption.
 According to the National Statistical Service, rent23.4% of employees are currently considered poor, and 1.9% -extremely poor [5, p. 56].
 The number of hired workers is 22.4%.
 Certainly, with this 23.4%, the entire amount of the mandatory accumulative payment will be reduced from consumption.
 In fact, mandatoryConsumption of these people as a result of the accumulative paymentfurther down the food line, resulting in deeper povertywill grow.
 And in general, regardless of whether the resident is hiswill reduce the amount of mandatory payment from consumption or from savings,The demand for consumer loans will increase among the population.
  It turns out that the population will have to have a higher interest rateto borrow the sums that he must pay accumulativelytransferred to accumulative funds.
Another important issue is the reduction of population deposits.
2012 year. The total amount of deposits made in Armenia as of the end of the year is 638 348.0 million drams, the average size of the deposit is
is 414213 drams [6].
 2011 The same index was 375,460 drams, that is, one
It increased by an average of 38,783 drams this year.
 This means an increase of 3231 drams per depositor per month.
 In fact, one depositor saves only 3231 drams on average each month.
 And:According to the average salary, the mandatory monthly accumulative payment is 7348 drams, more than twice as much.
 By the way, in case of making savings in the form of the same deposits, the citizen will havehigher income than investing in a pension fundIn addition, will have the money to dispose of it for a short period of timepossibility.
We believe that based on one or two articles or the results of the research, it is not possible to make a final decision on the possible effects of the implementation of the funded pension system.draw a conclusion.
 It is necessary to implement a comprehensive fieldresearch և analysis that unfortunately has not been done or notsubmitted by the relevant state bodies.
  More than thisarticle or various other professional analyzes and researches show that there are many risks,which question the effectiveness of this system, we think the state authorities needtry to answer the questions posed by specialists, which in turn will lead to the identification of possible effects of the system և increase efficiency.
 We have tried to single out և justify the existence of risks such as increasing poverty, state budgetThe increase of the expenditure burden, the imperfection of the mechanisms of accumulation of funds և further distribution և the possible outflow of capital from the Republic of Armenia.
In principle, not against the funded pension system:We think that the introduction of the system is premature, because so farThe above are not assessed at the level of scientific researchRisks, moreover, many studies prove the imperfection of the system, which in turn suggests that the smooth operation of the system is highly questionable.
  It should be noted that the introduction of the funded pension system has been largely successfulin countries with developed economies with high populationsstandard of living.
