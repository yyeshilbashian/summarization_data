We have tried to single out և substantiate the existence of such risks as the increase of the poverty level, the increase of the state budget expenditure burden, the imperfection of the mechanisms of accumulation of funds և further distribution և the possible outflow of capital from the Republic of Armenia.
 In principle, we are not against the funded pension system, we believe that the introduction of the system is premature, as the above-mentioned risks are almost underestimated at the level of scientific research, moreover, many studies prove the imperfection of the system, which in turn suggests that the system Uninterrupted operation is highly questionable.
 It should be noted that the introduction of the funded pension system has been mainly successful in countries with developed economies, where there is a high standard of living of the population.
The mandatory funded pension system in Armenia includes the able-bodied part of the employed population aged 15-40, who is actually registered in the relevant enterprises, institutions, allocates a certain amount of their salary to the funded pension fund, with the expectation that after retirement, in addition to the state pension , will receive an additional accumulated pension amount.
  Although the Law on Funded Pensions was adopted in our country in 2010, the voluntary pension component has been in force since 2011, but, in fact, no one has voluntarily transferred money to the funded funds.
 That institute has not been established in our republic for three years.
There are several reasons, among which the following can be singled out: the people's distrust of that system, the low level of income and salary of a significant part of the able-bodied population.
According to the RA Law on Funded Pensions, the mandatory funded component enters into force on January 1, 2014. Every salaried employee born after January 1, 2010 is obliged to accumulate 5% of his / her nominal monthly salary by transferring it to the pension funds.
 The mandatory component will refer to the 270 thousand 15-40 year old working population of Armenia.
  2012 year. According to current data, the number of 15-40-year-old population in our republic is 1388.9 thousand. (679.9 thousand - men, 709 thousand - women) [1, page 43].
 That is, 1118.9 thousand should not be transferred to the pension fund. people, which makes up 80.6% of the population in this age group, which is quite a high figure.
  Most of them are villagers, the unemployed, those who go out for seasonal work, and the workers in the shadows.
In that sense, according to approximate data, about half a million 15-40 year olds will not objectively pay to that accumulative fund.
 It should be noted that the number of people paying to the accumulative fund of villagers is about 770 thousand people.
 It is clear from the figures that 618.9 thousand people serve in the army, the other part is for seasonal work or permanently to other countries, the unemployed are employed in the shadow economy.
 Based on the above calculations, the most important question can be reached: to what extent will the system solve the welfare problem, if at the current stage only 20% of 15-40 year old citizens will participate in it, and the remaining 80% will not benefit from the high pensions provided by the system.
Now we will present some socio-economic and demographic indicators of the countries mentioned by the Government of the Republic of Armenia as experience of the accumulative pension system: Chile, Peru, Estonia.
Let us state that they are nations formed in different environments compared to the Republic of Armenia, which differ from each other in religion, history, ethnic psychology, material-spiritual values, work culture, geopolitical concepts.
 In other words, Armenia has nothing in common with those countries.
 In addition, the listed countries are at a higher level of socio-economic development than our republic.
 The demographic conditions presented in Table 1 are also different.

   In compiling the table, we used the statistical textbooks of the listed countries.
Table 1 shows that Armenia is in the last place in terms of GDP per capita.
  Besides, the average monthly salary in those countries fluctuates in the range of 1000-2000 dollars, and in our country it does not exceed 300.
  The figures show that our republic has nothing in common with those socio-economic countries.
 And this circumstance can be taken into account when passing to the accumulative pension system.
When moving to the funded pension system, one can predict the change in the population over the next 15-20 years.
  Taking into account that provision, we tried to predict what changes in the population and age structure of our republic will be subjected to after ten years.
 Table 2 shows what the demographic picture of the Republic of Armenia was like in the past, what it might be like in the future.
The trend of the age composition of the population of the Republic of Armenia in 1979-2025 / thousand people / Table 21979, 1989, 2001, 2011, 2025, human, human, human, the whole population.
  The share of the working-age population, the absolute number of the retirement age, has gradually increased, while the pre-working age population, on the contrary, has decreased.
 In other words, during those years there was an aging of the population and an increase in the number of pensioners.
 Without delving into the emergence of such demographic conditions, let us mention that one of the main reasons for the decrease in the number of births is the mass emigration of the population, which began at the end of the 20th century.
  And according to our approximate calculation, in 2025 In our republic, half of the population will be able-bodied population, and 1/4 - pensioners.
 Note that in 2015 The share of pensioners will continue to increase in the period after that, and those who pay the mandatory 40-year mandatory funded pension will receive their pension (if they do not raise the retirement age) from 2037.
 If the current demographic tendencies are maintained in the mentioned year, more than 1/3 of the population of our republic or about 500 thousand will make up the pensioners.
      Below are quantitative analyzes and forecasts of the funded pension system.
  2013 In January-October, according to the NSS [2], the average nominal salary in Armenia was 146,952 AMD.
 If we take this as the basis of our further calculations, the mandatory accumulative payment in case of this salary will make 7348 AMD, and the income after the maintenance of the mandatory income tax (36228 AMD) will make 103317 AMD.
 In fact, the mandatory component actually makes up 6.63% of the average net salary after tax.
 This number varies depending on the estimated salary և up to 13%, but it is always more than 5%, which distorts the economic content of the mandatory component, as the participant actually contributes to his / her taxable , that is, for unmanaged income.
The number of economically active population of the Republic of Armenia in 2012 The average was 1418.3 thousand people, of which 663.2 thousand are employees.
 According to preliminary forecasts, about 270,000 employees will become participants in the mandatory funded component.
 According to the calculation of the average salary, as we have already mentioned above, the accumulative payment is 7348 drams, which means that the payment made by the employees to the pension funds next year will be not less than 23 807.5 million drams.
 In fact, this amount will be a little more than the amount of more than 5% paid by the participants of the mandatory funded system, who receive more than 500,000 salaries.
RA 2013 Expenditures on social protection in the state budget amounted to 304696.8 million drams, and in 2014 The state budget envisages an increase of funds aimed at social protection up to 362030.6 million drams.
 The additional 20 billion is envisaged for the introduction of the accumulative pension system, and the remaining amount is, in fact, the amount with which the state will make allocations to the pension funds in parallel with the payments of the population.
In fact, in the coming years, mandatory pension payments will become an additional burden not only for hired workers, but also for the state budget.
 Moreover, in the case of the state budget, these expenses will increase year by year, as the number of employees born on or after January 1, 1974 will increase year by year due to the transfer of young people to hired work.
 1974 Those born after January 1 are citizens aged 0-40.
 If we take into account that people become able to work in accordance with the law, starting from the age of 15, we can state that the current allocations of about 25 billion drams are made for 16-40-year-olds, ie about 25 different age groups in general.
 Thus, we can state that each year, one age group of my employees will increase, that is, on average, there will be an increase of 1/25 of the participants in the mandatory funded component, և in parallel, the budget expenditures will increase by the same proportion, approximately 1 / of the current expenditures. In the amount of 25.
 This means that this expenditure item of the annual budget will increase by about 1 billion drams; in 25 years it will make almost 50 billion drams a year.
  This number is RA 2013. It is about 5% of the state budget, it is enough to understand what kind of expenditure burden the mandatory accumulative system will become for the state budget.
It should be noted that during this period, ie in the next 25 years, the state budget expenditures on pensions will not decrease, on the contrary, according to government data, will increase as a result of a sharp increase in birth rates in the 50s in the coming years. because [3].
 In other words, the reduction of the state budget and social burden will start only after 25 years, when the first participants of the mandatory funded system will start receiving their multi-level pensions.
 In the following years, only the amount of pension allocations to the given age groups by the budget will start to decrease continuously.
Taking into account the above-mentioned calculations made by us - the expected annual increases in the allocations from the state budget to the pension funds, the question arises as to how timely the adoption of the law is, the application, when, for example, in 2014 The state budget project envisages a deficit of 110,534,580.0 drams, and about 29.2% of the state budget expenditures are planned to be directed to social protection expenditures / 364,361,632.5 drams 1,246,437,412. of total expenses / [4].
We believe that one of the consequences of the transition to funded pensions may be the increase in the poverty rate due to the reduction of consumption.
 According to the National Statistics Service, 23.4% of employees are currently considered poor and 1.9% are extremely poor [5, p. 56].
 The number of hired workers is 22.4%.
 Certainly, with this 23.4%, the entire amount of the mandatory accumulative payment will be reduced from consumption.
 In fact, as a result of the mandatory funded payment, the consumption of these people will fall further from the food line, as a result of which the depth of poverty will increase.
 And in general, regardless of the fact that the resident will reduce the amount of the mandatory payment from consumption or the savings, the demand for consumer loans will increase among the population.
  It turns out that the population will have to borrow at a higher interest rate the amounts that it has transferred to the accumulative funds with the obligatory accumulative payment.
Another important issue is the reduction of population deposits.
2012 year. As of the end of the year, the total amount of deposits made in Armenia made 638 348.0 million drams, the average size of the deposit made 414213 drams [6].
 2011 The same index made 375 460 drams, that is, it increased by 38783 drams on average in one year.
 This means an increase of 3231 drams per depositor per month.
 In fact, one depositor saves only 3231 drams on average each month.
 According to the calculation of the average salary, the mandatory monthly accumulative payment is 7348 drams, more than twice as much.
 By the way, in case of making savings in the form of the same deposits, the citizen will have higher incomes than when investing in the pension fund, besides, he will have the opportunity to manage the given amount in the short term.
We believe that based on one or two articles or the results of the research, it is not possible to draw a final conclusion on the possible effects of the implementation of the funded pension system.
 It is necessary to carry out a comprehensive research in the field ոլոր analysis, which unfortunately has not been done or is not presented by the relevant state bodies.
  Moreover, both this article and the results of various other professional analyzes and researches prove that there are many risks that question the effectiveness of this system, we believe that the responsible state bodies should try to answer the questions posed by specialists, which in turn, will lead to the identification of possible effects of the system և increase in efficiency.
 We have tried to single out և substantiate the existence of such risks as the increase of the poverty level, the increase of the state budget expenditure burden, the imperfection of the mechanisms of accumulation of funds և further distribution և the possible outflow of capital from the Republic of Armenia.
We are not against the funded pension system in principle, we believe that the introduction of the system is premature, as the above-mentioned risks have not been assessed at the level of current research, moreover, many studies prove the imperfection of the system, which in turn suggests that the system is suspicious.
  It should be noted that the introduction of the funded pension system has been successful mainly in countries with developed economies, where there is a high standard of living of the population.
