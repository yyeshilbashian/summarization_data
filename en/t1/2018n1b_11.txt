The events that took place in Armenia in the last quarter of the 20th century, successively, broke all the established stereotypes, changed the normal course and description of the life of the country everywhere, including in Gyumri.
 Being traditionally a cultural city, referring to all the changes and innovations, Leninakan (Gyumri) responded to political, economic and cultural turning points.
 The collapse of the Soviet Union, the independence of Armenia, the Karabakh war, the devastating earthquake put their stamp on the psychology of the people.
 The city "lost" its history both ideologically and materially. The connection between the past and the present was broken. "
 Reality was divided into two parts: before the earthquake, then, as Baudelaire would say, "the old was not over, and the new had not yet begun."
  Many, appearing between the two value systems, lost their face and surrendered to the whim of fate.
 Artists, on the contrary, tried to fight with time and circumstances, revealing the ideas of new times, hidden meanings, features. They used their art to pave the way for the establishment of new ideas.
Each of the older generation of artists reacted differently to the changes of the time.
 Representatives of the 1960s, Sergey Mirzoyan and Ashot Hovhannisyan, predicted 1988 in their paintings. disaster.
 Thus, Mirzoyan's 1987 The "Seven" canvas created by him was predictive. It was like saying goodbye to Leninakan, which would turn into ruins a year later.
  The painting is made with amazing freedom, solid creams, bright color contrasts.
 The scene is selected from a high point of view. The picture is monumental, complete.
 After the earthquake, Mirzoyan temporarily stopped creating. He seemed to have lost touch with his beloved city.
 And, as it happens in such cases, the self-painting revived him again.
 He started painting with bright, active colors, with unprecedented solid creams.
 1997 The painted "Surb Nshan Church" becomes Mirzoyan's new business card in art.
 The silvery church is outlined against the dark night sky.
 It stands firm in the face of all trials and tribulations.
 The sublime and proud description of the church inspires faith. As long as the temple of faith stands, the city will exist ... Ashot Hovhannisyan felt a special connection with Leninakan.
 In his words, "Leninakan at that time seemed to me the only city in the world."
 1988 "Prediction. "Self-portrait" became really predictable for his favorite city.
 The picture shows a broken head, a deformed face, from which light radiates, in the penetrating eyes there is the salt of salvation. The background of the picture is highlighted with intense red.
 It seems to predict the impending catastrophe and the infinite human tragedy… On this occasion, the artist wrote: "Reality has never been able to influence an artist.
 The artist is hypersensitive և I have not missed the brush for more than a week in my whole life, I did not enter the studio for a month and a half this winter.
 Indeed, the physical impact is very great, but we must face J. mentally. Panic is inadmissible…. We must be able to draw the right conclusions. ”[2]։ There were painters who, while painting Gyumri, never painted its ruins and wounds.
 For them, Gyumri always remained an ostentatious and poetic city.
 In Vardparonyan's paintings "Old Leninakan", "Old District", "Winter in Gyumri" there is nostalgia, sadness, endless life philosophy of losing and rediscovering… But he never painted the ruined city.
We can consider the works of photographer Hayk Adamyan as a document of the city, which are urban scenes "viewed" and "seen" by his camera, before the disaster and in the period after the disaster.
  They are the documentary basis of time and the city.
Looking at the city with "open eyes", the artist told a merciless truth about the wounds of the city, but after a short time his nerves could not stand it.
  He decides to leave his beloved city, going to the distant United States ... The theme of the earthquake is key in the work of sculptor Zaven Koshtoyan.
 Koshtoyan summed up the loss of his life and the many victims of the earthquake in the mother and child monument dedicated to the victims of the earthquake, where the mother protects the child from the weight of the walls that were pressed and endangered their lives.
 Thus, Koshtoyan turns his personal tragedy into a universal tragedy, makes it a unique embodiment of "Pieta".
  The statue was located in the yard of Amenaprkich Church (later moved to Ani (58) district, church yard), and in 2008 It is replaced by the sculpture "Innocent Victims, Benevolent Hearts" by Moscow-based sculptor Frid Soghoyan, which was donated to the city on the anniversary of the earthquake.
Interestingly, the artists of the 1980s generation turned to religion in the 2000s, trying to find answers to their torturous questions.
 The religious ranks of Garik Manukyan and Gagik Manukyan were aimed at revealing deep values.
 What was this? A tribute to time, the discovery of topics that have been banned for years, or an attempt at self-examination and catharsis of one's own inner world? "Descent from the Cross", "Resurrection".
  These topics were kept "under 7 closed" in the Soviet Union for a long time.
The artist tried to view the catastrophe in the realm of the Christian series catastrophe ("Crucifixion") and rebirth ("Resurrection").
In the "Location" series, Garik Manukyan compared natural disasters, such as tides and earthquakes, showing a real state of nature that has a well-known abstraction.
 The artist saw the information in Denmark. The sea, retreating, left on the sand moss, crawling fish, shells, its "wealth" in the form of real and imaginary fragments.
 Disaster disrupts the course of nature, harmony.
The artist presented his series from a philosophical point of view, gave interesting interpretations, found new expressions.
There were artists who, while talking about the catastrophe, used their symbolic symbolic language and means of expression.
 The theme of the earthquake made me go back to history, the past layers of the city… "When I realized that the ground was breathing, it even exploded under my feet, this is where the conversation with nature began," said Hambardzum Ghukasyan.
 He could not create for a long time after the 1988 earthquake.
 After the break, taking the brushes in hand, he first created the "Requiem" abstract series.
  Choosing the scenes that are the symbol of the city, the building of the Savior, Abovyan Avenue, the viewpoint opening from the park, he put them in certain color relations.
  Color acquires an echo symbolic meaning.
 "The idea of ​​a color symbol penetrated my work when I saw the spectral sequence of colors in nature in Gurzuf.
 Everything in nature is regular, regulated. "[2]
  This discovery was continued in the "Zhamanak" series, which referred to the description of post-earthquake Gyumri.
  The key to the series is the tuning fork, which seems to notice the heartbeat of the city.
  The first painting depicts the Savior in gray. The tuning fork does not move.
 This is post-earthquake Gyumri, cold and motionless.
 In the other canvas, the tuning fork moves, and the colors of the painting become warm and dark.
 The pulse of Gyumri is beating, its wounds are healing.
  Against the background of the city, Ghukasyan depicts its inhabitants, lovers of sacrifices and khash, actors and dancers, beggars and ... knights, who try to save the city from despair, politeness, starvation ... One of the important cultural events of post-earthquake Gyumri was the Gyumri Biennale. It was the sum of the two festivals of the Biennale and the Cassell Documentary.
 The founders were Vazgen Pahlavuni-Tadjosyan and Azat Sargsyan, who organized and held the Biennale without any serious funding.
Speaking about the Gyumri Biennale, the authors mention its post-Soviet, post-catastrophic, post-industrial, post-authoritarian, in general, being "with" / "post" /.
 Initially aiming to enliven the cultural life in Gyumri, the Biennale also sought to be involved in the context of contemporary art.
  However, time has shown that Gyumri remained in the status of "back".
 From the very beginning, he did not set himself the goal of discussing contemporary art, in essence, in that "position".
 This is what the articles in the various catalogs of the Biennale speak about, in which it is always mentioned that "Gyumri is an earthquake city.
  The Gyumri Biennale was more than a favorable place, where there was an opportunity to take a step forward, to create the future, thus keeping the Tradition / History /.
 More precisely, it will be the future of itself. ”
[3] One of the most symbolic works of the Gyumri Biennale is sculptor Albert Vardanyan's "Surgical Intervention" installation.
"The Biennale found itself at a dead end, unable to pave the way it wanted to walk."
  A total of 8 Biennials were organized. Each had its own title and concept.
 Although the organizers tried to place all this in the context of modern world art, the majority of Gyumri residents did not accept conceptual art. It remained in the interest of artists and academy students.
Thus, each of the older generation of artists reacts differently to the changes of the time.
Today, the situation in post-earthquake Gyumri is reminiscent of Jürgen Habermas' phrase "the modernity of the past" - the fact that the past is modern.
 [4] Gyumri, with its rich cultural traditions, has found itself in a field of cultural dichotomy.
 The city has creative potential, does not have the opportunity to develop it, having talented artists, does not have a gallery, a museum of modern art.
