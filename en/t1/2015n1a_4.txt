   As we know, in quantum structures, particularly in the case of semiconductors with restricted bandwidths, a slight inversion layer forms near the sample separation boundary, which causes the edges of the energy bands to fluctuate, that is, to form a potential charge for the charge carriers.
 For such a heterogeneity (for example, dual heterostructures are usually formed), where the thickness of the narrow strip is the length of the shielding of the electrostatic potential.
 As a result, one-dimensional "rectangular" potential wells are formed, in which two-dimensional electronic gas is localized.

  It becomes accessible as a result of controllability of super-network layers, creating ample opportunities to improve the performance of semiconductor structures.
Moreover, the potential profile of the well completely predetermines the position of the energy levels of the connected states.
 As a result of the initial potential transformation of the well, shifts of individual intermediate levels are available, according to the energy scale, removal of polarized levels from the energy spectrum of the well, or addition of the spectrum at normal levels, variations of localized localization, scattering management, etc.
  Zakhar's work, in particular, is devoted to the spectral control algorithm of quantum states [1].
Let us try to apply the possibilities of geometric modeling to such problems below, which can provide guarantees for making qualitative (often also quantitative) quantitative estimates, bypassing the computational difficulties.
For the sake of simplicity, let us consider the infinitely deep rectangular potential problem of orientation, which is the result of abstraction, where if assumes other values.
   line.1 For states with a positive pair, it is -cent.
For negatively coupled states, it is a pair [2] (Fig. 1).
Let us now geometrically represent the solutions of equations (1) (3) and (4) in a potential well by introducing the idea of ​​a wavefunction plane, one of the axes of which is the values ​​of -c and the other the values ​​of -s corresponding to the change in -spatial coordinate versus in the range.
  It is easy to notice that the potential in the "phase" plane introduced to the wave functions 22 * 222 namEnnxaacos2n22 * 222namEnnxaasin2n Իոնալxdxxdx2ax2axxqxp, the functional behavior of discrete states of a quantum particle localized in a well is represented by an elliptical "phase trajectory".
 Indeed, we will get the equation of the phase trajectories from the number of states with a particularly positive pair.
 The above is true for negative pair states.
According to the և values ​​(for the lower quantum states), construct several phase trajectories whose starting and ending points correspond to the localization range of the quantum microparticle, respectively և the endpoints (Fig. 2).
  Now let's enter the polar coordinates in the phase plane.
 We will have a phase trajectory equation.
                (6) That is, each quantum state in a rectangular potential well is plotted in the phase plane by a rotation of the vector-line, line 2, which is realized in parallel with the change of the -spatial coordinate in the range.
 Moreover, the angle of rotation for even states, and for even states -.
Here it is assumed that the angle is calculated from the starting axis in a clockwise direction.
  The surface of an elliptical trajectory, and the quantum state energy.
                                 (7) It is easy to see that a is the area drawn by the radius vector representing each quantum state in the phase plane in the case of rotation from the beginning to the end, which corresponds to the range of the coordinate change. .

  Thus, in the case of a particle, a complete ellipse, the energy of the quantum state is directly related to the area drawn by the corresponding radius-vector.
The final conclusion can also be reached as a result of microtubbing in the more general dimension.
  Indeed, the quantum stationary state of a particle
The area of ​​the elementary sector drawn by the radius-vector is approximately equal to the area of ​​the elementary sector, where and (Fig. 3).
That is, the final surface drawn is line 3.
 And the radius-vector (a) On the other hand, the average energy of a given quantum state.
 Given the fact that the impulse operator is self-dissolving, we have (b) Combining (a) և (b) the results, we can write.1 n2n4nnEnnSxqxp ; 2222xxqpOBMSdSOBNONOBdBN: LddldSNB221212121212220122121xxdxxxddSS 2121 * 2 * 2xxxxedxxUdxmpUTEdxxUmExxe122222 (subject to normalization condition) և (c) Considering the functional behavior of the potential in the problem under consideration (
 The second term on the right hand side of (c) can be considered stable, that is, the conclusion of the dependence of the radius-vector on the radius-vector representing that state on the "phase" plane on the "phase" plane can be considered valid.
Let us now consider the possibility of geometric modeling of a quantum well with a more complex profile.
  In particular, consider the changes in the energy spectrum of the main state of a rectangular quantum well with infinitely high walls due to an additional drop in arc potential in the center of the well (Fig. 4).
 The solution of such a problem within the accepted quantum-mechanical scheme [3] requires a certain volume of calculation, the possible bypass of which is the purpose of the following observation.
 It should be noted that the potential drop in heterostructures is achieved by changing the composition of the solid solution, as a result of which the effective charge masses in the 1,2,3 ranges are generally different.

  In the "phase" plane, draw the trajectories of a microparticle in the 2 և 1, 3 domains.
 Phase of the quantum state with energy for 2 domains.
   The phase trajectory in 2 domains is an ellipse given by the polar coordinates with respect to (11).
In zones 1, 3, հավասար the phase trajectory equation, represented by the polar coordinates, has the following appearance (Fig. 5). It is obvious that at the points of potential continuity fracture, the wave function of a microparticle և its first-order derivative must maintain its continuity.
  Geometrically denotes the intersection of phase trajectories at certain "bent" points on the phase plane.
 That is, Here.
  Let's discuss the case when.

  with phase trajectory site, in the domain with phase trajectory site.
  Note that in the absence of an additional potential drop in the current, the stationary quantum state of the initial profile of the quantum well would be mapped (when) by a phase trajectory.
  Thus, based on the above observation of the existing dependence of the state energy եսի on the phase bounded by the phase trajectory,, we can conclude that in this case the potential overlap in the well leads to a decrease in the allowable energy level of the main well state according to the energy scale.
 It is easy to notice that in a similar situation
The decrease of "leads to the decrease of", then "(according to (13)), which in turn leads to the formation of a phase with a greater inclusion phase, ie the deviation of the energy level along the energy scale (Fig. 6).
  And the growth of, naturally, leads to the opposite situation.
The qualitative conclusions made are almost consistent with the results of an accurate quantum mechanical observation [3].
  Let us now consider the situation of the first excited quantum.
 1. Assume a potential well for a potential state when the profile corresponds to situation (a) which is equivalent to the plane qp, 2M22bxa 11M1NM2bx00NM02N22axb: 111N2bx11Emk2 * 112 * 1 * 0mm1n * 0m0k000101101 MNMNMSS0U2n2bxmqp, : mMxxabbabx2322232 layout (Fig. 7).

  Thus, a) in the potential hole in the profile, the stationary quantum state with energy is realized according to the phase trajectory of the phase plane.

 The combined energy levels of the energies of the two quantum states are a) the complex profile drilling is obvious.

The comparison of the phase to post-energetic state in the initial rectangular potential well is not obvious, ական Quantitative comparison of areas bounded by phase trajectories is required (Fig. 8).
                                                             Fig. 7 (a) (b) Fig. 8 The observations show that the geometric representations of quantum stationary states in the above-mentioned "phase" plane can serve as an additional data on possible energy level shifts during various transformations of the quantum well profile.
To be more consistent, we can introduce the idea of ​​three-dimensional, so-called phase quantum space:
by filling the equation with a vertical third axis of energies, where the representations of the possible states of a microparticle are localized on a definite surface.
  Horizontal elliptical sections of such a surface with a floor at the point will correspond to the phase trajectories of a microparticle in discrete quantum states.
