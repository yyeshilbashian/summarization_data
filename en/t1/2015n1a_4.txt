Let us now consider the problem of a quantum well with a more complex profilethe possibility of geometric modeling.
  In particular, consider the base of a rectangular quantum well with infinitely high wallsChanges in the energy spectrum of the state present in the center of the wellfollowing an additional drop in potential (Fig. 4).
 The solution of such a problem within the accepted quantum-mechanical scheme [3] requiresa certain volume of calculation, the possible bypass of which is performed belowis the purpose of monitoring.
 Note that the potential drop in heterostructures is achieved by changing the composition of the solid solution, resulting in charges in the range of 1,2,3The effective masses are generally different.
