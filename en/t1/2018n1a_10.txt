Introduction.
 It is known that climatic conditions have a significant impact on people's health and activities.
  They are important elements of the recreational complex, as the work of the sanatorium-resort economy, tourist centers is largely conditioned by the weather conditions.
 The latter can be used for tourist routes, mountaineering, as well as many other branches of recreation.
 Given the above, the climatic conditions of any area can be considered as a recreational resource.
 Favorable climates and weather are very important for a person's mental and physiological rest [1].
 Material և methodology.
 Meteorological factors have a complex effect on a person outside.
 We consider it expedient to calculate human heat sensitivity according to the equivalent effective temperature (EEG), which shows the total effect of temperature, humidity and wind speed.
 The equivalent effective temperature calculation was performed according to two formulas.
  The first of them is A. The formula proposed by Missenard is [4]. 1,76 + 1,4 × (cid.

where t is the air temperature 0C, v is the wind speed m / s, and f is the relative humidity in%.
 The data of 17 meteorological stations are the starting point for the calculation of EEC values ​​within the study area.
 The average temperature of the hottest և coldest months was taken as the air temperature, the humidity indices of the warmest և coldest months were taken as relative humidity.
 It can be emphasized that meteorological stations have completely different hypsometric positions, their altitudes range from 460 to 2020 m, which means that they are spread in almost all altitude zones of the study area.
 Referring to the calculation of EEC values, let us mention that the calculation with the above-mentioned formula was performed in MS Excel environment, where the sub-formula (1) was constructed, then the relevant air data were entered, and the EEC indicators were obtained.

To perform the mapping, it was necessary to take the data of the absolute height of the starting points և geographical coordinates taken from the Google Earth environment.
 Further mapping was done in Surfer14 software environment.
In the first step, the initial EEC data were subjected to the Kriging method by interpolation, as a result of which the output raster characterizing the quantitative field of EEC values ​​within the borders of Northern Armenia (Shirak, Lori, Tavush) was obtained.
Next, the color scale of the thematic layer was constructed, the step of the equilibrium of the quantitative field was chosen.
 The results are presented in Figure 1 և 2 below.
For tourists who are in nature, the weather conditions are very favorable.
 From the weather indicators, the air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed have a significant impact on a person.
 The assessment of the bioclimatic indicators of the territory of Northern Armenia is used mainly for the purpose of outdoor resort (eco-tourism, mountain tourism, health walk Gylen).

Therefore, the so-called "comfort zone" is more used.
 Temperatures from 17 ° to 23 ° are comfortable for a healthy person.
 Moreover, it should be noted that for active recreants, 12-16 ° equivalent-effective temperature is considered comfortable [2, p. 47].
According to the data received, the analysis of the maps compiled by us in general shows that the territory of Northern Armenia has mostly favorable bioclimatic indicators for recreation and tourism.

According to the EEC summer months, there are comfortable warm temperatures (EEC = 18 ° C) in the northeast and a cool (EEC = 9 ° C) in the north-west.
It should be noted that the most comfortable indicators (EE = 12-18 ° C) are present in Lori region, where the conditions in the regions east of the Spitak-Tashir line are more than favorable.
There are favorable summer conditions in Gyumri and its surroundings.
 In order to avoid the summer heat, the Ashotsk plateau stands out with the predominance of cool weather, as well as the settlement of Lermontovo in the Lori region and its surroundings.
 The analysis of the data shows that no strong heat loads are registered in the territory of Northern Armenia.
Winter tourism is also of great importance for Northern Armenia, the development of which can reduce the seasonal disproportion of tourism in the region.
 The calculation of the comfort of the winter season, according to the EEC, has the following picture (Fig. 2).
 The lowest values ​​are obtained in the north-west of the study area, in the Arpi Lake basin, where the value of EEC decreases to -22 ° C or "very cold".
 Low values ​​were also recorded in the Tashir region (EE = 16 ° C, or "cold") in the Lermontovo region.
In winter, relatively mild conditions are formed in the region east of the Odzun-Dilijan isotherm (-9 ° C), where winter EEG can be assessed as "very cool" (EEG = -6-7 ° C).
Fig. 3 Map-Scheme for Assessing the Weather Severity of the Territory of Northern Armenia (according to Osokin, 1968) [5] is the height of the place (Fig. 3).
 In contrast to the EEC, the Osokin method evaluated the scores, which show the severity of the weather in the area.
 According to the obtained indicators, there are more severe winter conditions in the north-western region of the studied area, in Ashotsk depression.
Table 2.
 According to Bodman, the winter hardiness scale.
Winter Strictness Quality Score S Mild Winter Slightly Cold Winter Moderately Cold Cold Too Cold Extreme Cold Extreme Severe Cold The results are, in our view, due to the scarcity of meteorological data and the large interpolation area.
  Compared to the EEZ values ​​of winter temperatures, the results obtained by the Osokin method have approximately the same spatial distribution.
 The stiffness of the area decreases from north-west to northeast, moreover, the main reason for the stiffness reduction is the decrease of hypsometric heights.
Conclusions.
 The analysis of the results ների of the performed calculations shows that .1. Almost the whole territory of Northern Armenia has favorable bioclimatic conditions for the development of recreation and tourism.
2. Comfortable warm temperatures (EEG = 18 ° C) prevail in the eastern, northeastern and partly northeastern regions of Lori marz of Tavush region.
3. The most favorable conditions for winter recreation are in the western-northwestern regions of Northern Armenia, up to the So = 10 isogene.
4. EEC indicators in the studied area undergo significant changes, both in summer and winter months.
 Conditions for tourists may be unfavorable in the highlands of the northwestern region, north-west of So = 10, where there is a risk of frostbite in case of severe winters.
The research was carried out due to the financial support provided by the University, within the framework of S GSPI 01-SCI-2017 scientific topic.
