It is difficult to refer to all the types of recreation in one article, so we consider it more expedient to analyze the possibilities of organizing winter rest in the natural conditions of Ashotsk.
At present, no one disputes the view that favorable climatic conditions are necessary for the organization of recreation, tourism, favorable natural environment.
It has been emphasized many times that the main precondition for the development of recreation is the natural factors, the assessment of which is most important for the development of this branch.
The scientific basis for the assessment of recreational resources has been laid by Soviet scientists since the 1970s.
 The most famous works of recreational geography are V.S. Preobrazhensky (1975), Yu. A. Vedenin (1969), N.N. Miroshnichenko (1969, 1984), BN Likhanov (1973), N.S. Mironenko, NT The works of Tverdokhlebov (1981) և others.
  The vast majority of these scientists have come to the conclusion that a comprehensive assessment of the area is a key condition for the development of recreational potential.
In this respect, it is more difficult to assess mountain recreational resources, as it is necessary to take into account certain features due to the difficult terrain, climatic conditions (from favorable to unfavorable), diverse landscapes, snow cover.
One of the important tasks in organizing mountain recreation is the correct organization of the time-season component.
  The seasonal situation is a resource for mountainous terrestrial systems with different functional meanings.
  The nature of the recreational activity may be conditioned by the climatic features of the mountains.
  Each season is characterized by a certain type of recreational activity.
  Seasonal considerations can be taken into account not only for the effective organization of recreational activities, but also for safety reasons.
The analysis of contributing and limiting factors, in which climatic conditions play a decisive role, is of great importance in the recreational development of mountainous countries.
 In this respect, the typification of methods based on human physiological comfort 1 is especially important.
During the classification (separation) of the seasons, we considered it expedient to use the frost wind, the temperature threshold.
In our opinion, such an approach is more important in the organization of mountain recreation, as the use of such a geological indicator allows to clarify the capabilities of the person outside.
  According to the favorable weather, the climates for mountain recreation can be classified in the following order: a) exceptionally favorable (duration: 210-240 days), b) favorable (duration: 150 - 210 days), c) less favorable (duration: 90150 days).
The minimum benefit threshold is 90 days, taking into account the economic efficiency 2.
For the recreational assessment of the natural conditions of the area, it is necessary to take the so-called nodes, on the basis of which the assessment can be carried out.
 In addition, expert data can be used for evaluation.
  The obtained results are processed by the method of statistical analysis.
To get more accurate results, you can also choose the right rating scale.
For the assessment of winter recreation in the Ashotsk region, it is possible to take 3 nodes, which are meteorological stations and posts.
  The mapping of the results of the assessment of Ashotsk winter recreational resources should be carried out on a large scale (at least 1).
100000), because in the case of a smaller scale it is not possible to imagine the change of comfort conditions at the regional-regional levels.
From the natural-ecological conditions that affect the organization of winter rest, we have selected 10 indicators, 9 of which are climatic, և 1 - non-climatic.
 The main condition for the selection of indicators should be comparability և reliability of observations.
  Considering the above, it is expedient to consider taking data from the USSR Climate Corporation, Vyp. 16, ArmSSR ”, as well as the data published by the RA Hydrometeorological Department (see Table 1).
In contrast to the many existing scales, most of which are 5-point 3, we have developed a 7-point scale, which, in our opinion, will allow you to more fully evaluate any factor.
 The evaluation score increases with the increase of the comfort factor.
  The highest score is ten and the lowest is one.
When assessing winter rest conditions, the highest scores are formed according to the following indicators: Stable snow cover և altitude, average winter temperatures թվ number of sunny days.
The lowest points can be caused by snowstorms, fogs, as well as the number of days with strong winds.
  The magnitude of the evaluation scores was determined by a conventional continuous (gradual) scale.
  At the same time, by clarifying the primary indicators, it is not possible to obtain accurate data on natural conditions, which will show the comfort of the environment.
  For this reason, measurability (efficiency) coefficients have been set for each indicator (from one (smallest indicator) to five (for the most essential indicator).
  These coefficients allow to express the ratios of each component (element) of the environment for winter rest, in particular for skiing.

The comparison of the scale և measurability coefficient can be expressed by a unified formula for assessing comfort, which was proposed by V. I. 4 by Fedotov.
 The latter, in essence, represents the arithmetic mean և has the following appearance: where A is the overall score of the degree of comfort of natural conditions, C is the score of the i-th element of the third grade, K is the coefficient of measurability of the i-th element of the rating.
 The weighted average score gives an idea of ​​the general բար relative advantage (or disadvantage).
Table 2. Scoring of 10 indicators in Ashotsk regionViewpointAmasiaAshotsPaghakAssessment indicators (in points) Average All grades should be given without rounding, ie exactly as it was obtained after the calculation.
  Table 2 presents the scores of natural conditions indicators.
Based on the obtained data, by interpolation method, isovites are shown at the nodes, which show equal comfort levels (Fig. 1).
  Mapping can be done with GIS Mapinfo 5.0.
  The scale may depend on the purpose of the map.
  In our opinion, it is more expedient to map the assessment of winter recreational resources in Ashotsk region1.
On a scale of 100,000.
To make the evaluation principles more sound, some data evaluation criteria are presented below.
The choice of place, the peculiarity of snow-weather conditions are very important for the efficient use of snow cover resources.
 For alpine skiing, the minimum height of snow cover should be 30 cm, and for mass recreation - 40-50 cm 5.
 Taking into account these data, we have estimated this index with a maximum value of 7 points for all three observation points, as, according to the data of Table 1, the average height of snow cover in the three observation points fluctuates between 74-84.
 This is also the most important factor for skiing, so the coefficient of efficiency is estimated at 5 points.
During the assessment, we took into account not only the multi-year average data, but also the possible development options.
 In this case, the most important factor for the organization of alpine skiing is guaranteed in any case of possible development, because, according to many years of observations, the probability of no snow formation in all 3 observation points is equal to 0 6.
Strong winds are one of the limiting factors of winter recreation.
 The highest rates of strong winds in Amasia are observed in the period from March to August, which does not interfere with the organization of winter recreation.
  Thus, in December, the average number of strong winds in Amasia in the period November-March is 11 days. It is only 7% of the days spent skiing, which is generally a good indicator 7.
Based on the data, this factor can get 5 points in the rating scale.
 The other observation points were evaluated by the same principle.

500,000.
The dynamics of snow cover is greatly influenced by the snowstorm, which plays a significant role in mountainous, middle mountain and high mountain areas.
 During the blizzard, both the height of the snow cover and its density undergo great changes.
 In some parts, the height of the snow cover can be reduced to և 50 cm 8եկ per day, which is a negative factor for the organization of skiing, so it was rated 4-5 points for all observation points (see Table 2).
The fog has a significant effect on the height of the snow cover.
 In the absence of a negative temperature և wind, the fog, sitting on the snow cover, contributes to the melting of the snow and making a vow.
 During the day, under the influence of fog, in the conditions of negative temperature, high humidity և in the absence of wind, the height of snow cover can decrease up to և 5 cm 8.
 Given this circumstance, the fog factor was assessed as limiting և received 3-5 points (see Table 2).
Summarizing the above, some conclusions can be made.
1. Despite the relatively strict natural conditions, Ashotsk has all the opportunities for the development of winter recreation.
  The latter can become one of the key preconditions for economic development in the region.
2. According to the mapping results, the Isovites have a circular distribution, according to which the central areas of the region և Amasia sub-region stand out with the most favorable conditions.
3. Mountain recreation (especially in the highlands) uses areas that can not be used effectively in other areas of land use և fills the "vacuum" that arises in the field of economic use of natural complexes.
4. By preserving the geo-environmental component in the field of mountain recreational nature use, the efficiency of mountain recreation is increased, it cannot develop without the environmental component (vacationers need clean air և clean environment).
