It is difficult to talk about recreation in one articleall varieties, so we considered it more expedientAnalyze the organization of winter conditions in Ashotsk natural conditionsopportunities.
At present, no one questions the view thatthat are necessary for recreation and tourismFavorable climatic conditions և favorable natural environment.
Many times it is emphasized that the development of recreationThe main precondition is the natural factors, the assessment of which is most important for the development of the mentioned branch.
The scientific basis for the assessment of recreational resources has been laidBy Soviet scientists from the 70s of the 20th century.
 As the most famous works of recreational geographyby VS Preobrazhensky (1975), Yu. A. Vedenin (1969), N.N. Miroshnichenko
(1969,1984), B.N. Likhanov (1973), N.S. Mironenko, NT Tverdokhlebov
(1981) աշխատ The works of others.
  The vast majority of these scientists have come to the conclusion that a comprehensive assessment of the areais a crucial condition for the development of recreational potential.
In this respect, it is more difficult to assess mountain recreational resources, as it is necessary to take into account certain features due to the difficult terrain, climatic conditions (from favorable to unfavorable), diverse landscapes, snow cover.
One of the important tasks in organizing mountain recreation is the correct organization of the time-season component.
  Just seasonalThe state is a resource for mountainous terrestrial systemsin which, with different functional meanings.
  Mountain climatefeatures may be due to recreationthe nature of the activity.
  Each season is characterized by recreationa certain type of activity.
  Seasonal feature accountThis can be done not only for the effective organization of recreational activities, but also for security reasons.
Great importance in the recreational development of mountainous countriesreceives the analysis of contributing և limiting factors, where:Climatic conditions play a decisive role.
 In this regard, it is especially important based on the physiological comfort of mantypification of implemented methods 1.
During our classification (separation) of seasonsIt was considered expedient for frost wind to temperaturethe application of the threshold.
In our opinion, such an approach is more mountainousduring the organization of recreation, as the use of such a geo-environmental indicator allows to clarify the externalhuman capabilities.
  According to the weather, mountainousClimates for recreation can be classified in the following order: a) exceptionally favorable (duration: 210-240 days), b) favorable (duration: 150 - 210 days), c) less favorable (duration: 90150 days).
The minimum benefit threshold is 90 days, taking into account the economic efficiency 2.
For the recreational assessment of the natural conditions of the area, it is necessary to take the so-called nodes, on the basis of which the assessment can be carried out.
 In addition, evaluationExpert data can be used for this.
  The obtained results are processed by the method of statistical analysis.
Evaluation is also needed to get more accurate resultsthe right choice of scale.
For the assessment of winter recreation in Ashotsk regionYou can take 3 nodes, which are meteorological stationsThey are posts.
  Mapping of Ashotsk winter recreational resources assessment needs to be carried out on a large scale(at least 1.
100000), as it is not possible in case of a smaller scaledepict the change in comfort conditions at the regional։ regional levels.
From natural ոլոգ ecological conditions that affect winteron the organization of rest, we have selected 10 indicators,9 of which are climatic, և 1 - non-climatic.
 Selection of indicatorsThe main condition should be the comparability of observationsreliability.
  Given the above, it is advisableWe considered the data to be taken by the USSR Climate Director, Vyp. 16, Arm:
ССР ”, as well as the data published by the RA Hydrometeorological Department (see Table 1).
In contrast to the many existing scales, most of which are 5-point 3, we have developed a 7-point scale, which, in our opinion, will allow you to more fully evaluate any factor.
 The evaluation score increases with the increase of the comfort factor.
  The highest score is ten and the lowest is one.
When assessing winter rest conditions, the highest scores are formed according to the following indicators: Stable snow cover և altitude, average winter temperatures և sunny
in the number of days.
The lowest points can be caused by snowstorms, fogs, as well as the number of days with strong winds.
  The magnitude of the evaluation scores was determined by a conventional continuous (gradual) scale.
  At the same time clear of the primary indicatorsYou can not get accurate data on natural conditionswhich will show the comfort of the environment.
  For this reason, measurability (efficiency) coefficients have been set for each indicator, from one (smallest indicator) to five.(for the most essential indicator).
  These coefficients allow:express the relative of each component (element) of the environmentThe role of winter recreation, especially skiingfor organization.

The comparison of the scale և measurability coefficient can be expressed by a unified formula for assessing comfort, which was proposed by V. I. 4 by Fedotov.
 The latter, in fact, representsThe arithmetic mean is as follows.where A is the general degree of comfort of natural conditionsis the grade, C is the grade of the third element of the grade in points, K is the measurability coefficient of the third grade of the grade.
 The weighted average score gives an idea of ​​the general բար relative advantage (or disadvantage).
Table 2. 10 indicators of Ashotsk region Scoring:Viewpoint:AmasiaAshotskIce creamEvaluation indicators (in points)Average:It is necessary to give all the estimates without rounding, that is, exactly as it was obtained after the calculation.
  In Table 2are presented in the scoring assessment of natural conditions indicatorsthe results.
Based on the obtained data, by interpolation method, isovites are shown at the nodes, which show equal comfort levels (Fig. 1).
  Maps:Compilation can be done with GIS Mapinfo 5.0 program.
  The scale may depend on the purpose of the map.
  In our opinion, it is more expedient to map the assessment of winter recreational resources in Ashotsk region1.
On a scale of 100,000.
To make the evaluation principles more substantiatedBelow are some evaluation criteria for the data.
For efficient use of snow cover resourcesThe choice of local և snow-weather conditions is very importantfeature.
 Snow cover for skiingThe minimum height of the shoot should be 30 cm, and the massfor organizing rest - 40-50 cm 5.
 Given these data, we have rated this indicator for all three observation pointsThe maximum value is 7 points, because, according to the data in Table 1, the average height of snow cover in three observation points fluctuates 74-84 cmwithin.
 This is also the most important factor for skiing, so the coefficient of efficiency is estimated at 5 points.
During the assessment, we took into account not only the multi-year average data, but also the possible development options.
 This:essential for the organization of alpine skiingSnow cover is a factor, any possible developmentIn this case, it is guaranteed, because, according to long-term observations, the probability of no snow cover is equal to և6 in all 3 observation points.
Strong winds are one of the limiting factors of winter recreation.
 Maximum winds are observed in Amasiafrom March to August, which does not interfere with the organization of winter recreation.
  Thus, the average number of strong winds in Amasia in December is November-March11 days. It is only 7% of the days spent skiing, which is generally a good indicator 7.
Based on the data provided, this factor may be in the rating scaleget 5 points.
 They were evaluated on the same principle as other observation pointsdata.

The dynamics of snow cover is greatly affected by the snowstorm,which plays a significant role in mountainous, middle mountain և high mountain areas.
 During the blizzard, both the height of the snow cover and its density undergo great changes.
 In some partsThe height of the snow cover can be reduced to և in one day50 cm 8, which is a negative factor for the organization of skiing, so it was rated 4-5 points for all points of view (seeTable 2).
The fog has a significant effect on the height of the snow cover.
 In the absence of negative temperature ամ windThe fog, sitting on the snow cover, helps the snow to melt andto condense.
 During the day, under the influence of fog, in the conditions of negative temperature, high humidity և in the absence of wind, the height of snow cover can decrease up to և 5 cm 8.
 Note:Given this circumstance, the fog factor was rated as:restrictive և received 3-5 points (see Table 2).
Summarizing the above, some conclusions can be made.
1. Despite the relatively strict natural conditions, Ashotsk has it allopportunities for the development of winter recreation.
  The latter can become an opportunity for economic development in the regionone of the preconditions.
2. According to the mapping results, the isovites have a circular distribution, according to which they stand out on the most favorable terms.falls in the central parts of the region և Amasia subregion.
3. Use mountain recreation (especially in the highlands)Areas that can not be used effectively in other areas of land use և fill the "vacuum" that arises in the field of economic use of natural complexes.
4. Preserving the geo-environmental component in the field of mountain recreational nature use, it is raised to mountain recreationefficiency, it can not develop without an environmental component (vacationers need fresh air և cleanenvironment).
