Due to interdisciplinary connections, the school course becomes complete, and the teaching becomes effective and purposeful.
The role of algebra in geometry is special.
 In many cases, the impression is that the interdisciplinary relationship between these two subjects is very one-sided, that is, algebraicis the apparatus that contributes to various geometric problems ևdiscussion and solution of problems.
 But such a conclusion seemsis because there is also the opposite connection when different geometricIt is possible to solve some algebraic problems by applying the principles and patterns.
  This work is dedicated to revealing the opposite connection, when, using various facts known from the school of geometry, new approaches to solving some non-typical algebraic problems are proposed.
Problem 1:
.
 in case of which parameter values?The modulus of the difference of the roots of the equation will take the largestvalue.
Solution 1 (algebraic).
  If the given equation has roots,then for the root difference modulus we will have:thereforeeasyis:noticethat:, when:.
Solution 2 (geometric).
 Note that the given equation is equivalentis the following equation:which:  rectangularrepresents in the Cartesian coordinate system circle with an odd radiusրոնով և:equation / fig.1/.
 If the given equation What is the parameter?in the case of a jack has roots, thenthe modulus of difference of these roots will be equal  the length of the cord.
  So the modulus of the difference of the roots of a given equation will take the largest value when:  The length of the cord will be the maximum.
  And it will happen only if:is the diameter of the circle, that is, when.
Problem 2:.
 Determine the value of the expression..
