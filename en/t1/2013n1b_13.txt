Due to interdisciplinary connections, the school course becomes complete, and the teaching becomes effective and purposeful.
The role of algebra in geometry is special.
 In many cases, the impression is that the interdisciplinary connection between these two subjects is very one-sided, that is, it is the arithmetic apparatus that contributes to the discussion and solution of the problems of various geometric problems.
 However, such a conclusion seems to be due to the fact that there is also the opposite connection, when it is possible to solve some algebraic problems by applying different geometric principles and patterns.
  This work is dedicated to revealing the opposite connection, when, using various facts known from the school of geometry, new approaches to solving some non-typical algebraic problems are proposed.
Problem 1:
.
 For which values ​​of the parameter will the modulus of the difference of the roots of the equation take the largest value?
Solution 1 (algebraic).
  If the given equation has roots, then for the modulus of the difference of those roots we will have to reconsider when.
Solution 2 (geometric).
 Note that the given equation is equivalent to the following equation, which in the rectangular-coordinate coordinate system represents an equation with a circle with an odd radius / Fig.1 /.
 If the given equation has roots in some value of the parameter ar, then the modulus of difference of those roots will be equal to the length of the string.
  So the modulus of the difference of the roots of a given equation will take on a maximum value when the length of the string is at its maximum.
  And this will happen only when - is the diameter of the circle, that is, when.
Problem 2.
 Determine the value of the expression.
Solution 1 (algebraic).
  For some reason, then.

  Consider fifteen units of squares (Fig. 2).
  It is easy to notice that when the rectangle is rotated clockwise around the rectangle, the segment will be rotated by the's rotating rectangle, and in the segment, backwards, we insist that Ghurem.
  On the other hand, we will have from և Triangles-, since են are են sharp angles, then,։.
So, we will have:
Problem 3.
 Prove the equation. Solution 1 (algebraic).
 We have:
Solution 2 (geometric).
 Consider a right-angled triangle in which և.
 Let's take the points on the sides of that triangle, respectively, so that և / Fig.3/.
 It is easy to notice that we will have a triangle later.
 On the other hand, we will have "triangles".

Problem 4.
 Solve the equation.
Solution 1 (algebraic).
 Multiplying the two parts of the equation by the lever on the left side, we have, adding the given equation, we get:
 The resulting equation.
Answer:
  Solution 2 (geometric).
  It is easy to notice that if is the root of the chosen equation, then և will be the root of that equation, բավական so it is enough to solve the given equation for non-negatives ավելացնել add the opposite numbers of the latter to the obtained roots.
Consider the և triangles in which և / Fig. 4 /.
 According to the cosine theorem, we get և ներից from triangles.
On the other hand, according to the equation of triangle, we will have a number for a triangle, moreover, the case of the equation occurs only if the equation given backwards to the segment will have a solution only if the point belongs.

  Consider the rectangle, Crooked / Fig. 5 /.
It is easy to see that the rectangular quadrilateral can be plotted. Ptolemy's theorem holds that the product of any quadrilateral at right angles to the circle is equal to the sum of the products of the opposite sides of the quadrilateral.
  Therefore, we can write that the case of equality occurs only when է is rectangular, that is, when և.
