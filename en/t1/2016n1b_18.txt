New subjects integrated in general education և professional educational programs (Natural Science, Social Sciences, Healthy Lifestyle, Homeland Studies, I և the Surrounding World, Modern Problems of Natural Science, etc.) appear, the difficulties of organizing teaching make them address some issues.
 The main meaning of teaching integrated subjects is worldview, the goal is to create a unified whole picture of the universe in the learner's consciousness, the main feature of teaching methodology is, first of all, to provide an integrated approach to the analysis of the topic.
  It presupposes the study of a phenomenon with the aim of acquiring a basic, complete, comprehensive knowledge of drama, which must be accomplished not only by establishing a familiar connection with teachers, but also by discovering the essence of the phenomenon from the point of view of various (as well as related) sciences.
 Therefore, the teaching specialist is required not only good professional knowledge, but also intellectual development, worldview thinking, knowledge of special methods, creative approach to the process of organizing teaching.
 That is why the issue of developing a new methodology for organizing the teaching of integrated subjects becomes very necessary in modern pedagogy.
In this work, in particular, we want to touch upon the discovery of the potential of fairy tales in the teaching of natural sciences, to suggest teachers to use works of art as a means of fostering natural thinking, bio-philosophical knowledge, enriching the methodological treasury with the integration of humanities and natural sciences.
A fairy tale has a great potential for teaching a child in an understandable, non-scientific language without limiting the possibility of teaching knowledge in any field.
  The tools for learning fairy tales are mainly symbols.
 Although the means of symbolic thinking have been used for the spiritual development of the individual throughout human history, there is little research in the literature on the analysis of the pedagogical potential of symbolic thinking, especially on the methodology of its application [1, p. 100; 10, pp. 89, 11].
In our opinion, it is possible to find a layer of knowledge in all works of art, through the analysis of which one can teach a lot of natural knowledge, discover causal links between natural phenomena, develop symbolic-philosophical thinking, free-thinking comparisons, combinations.
  Teaching through a fairy tale presupposes interpreting and interpreting the concept, the concept by drawing parallels with the example of life, creating a connection between the "scientific knowledge" of reality, which makes the learning process psychologically pleasant and effective, as it is not accompanied by pressure from scientific terminology [6, p. 10].
  Instead, it is presented in child-familiar situations and characters [4, p. 10; 9, p. 18].
 The nascent feelings of art are well preserved in the memory ելով surviving, they strengthen the scientific convictions [7, pp. 60-64].
In addition, fairy tales not only address real-life problems, but also prompt the keys to solving them, enabling different ages to perceive problems and solutions in the environment in an evolutionary way, to develop thinking, to form a complete view of the world [5, p. 3].
When it is said in the fairy tale that "a man runs as fast as the wind, becomes a stone, then the petrified man becomes a man again", or "The winter trees dry up, become a burning wood, in the spring with some force beyond the man, they fade away" [6; page 11], then that story activates the child's curiosity to know the reason.
 It is this stimulus that should be used to teach the child through the given examples, on the one hand, the perfection of creation (which is beyond man), which is very important in realizing one's own place and role in the whole universe, on the other hand, such natural sciences as , material storage, wintering of plants, and regeneration from seed or re-germination from seed in spring.
Thus, a pedagogical and modern approach is to reveal the secret tips of art as a goal of teaching [4, p. 6].
  Let's try to present this through one of the most unique works of world children's literature, the English mathematician, psychic, storyteller Lewis Carroll's "Alice in Wonderland, Alice in the Mirror" fairy tales, which have not been studied by researchers in various fields for more than 150 years.
 The selected tales are full of biological characters-symbols, which has stimulated our interest in revealing their educational potential.
In our earlier references to these tales, the allegorical mysteries of subtitles, characters, situations, the author's biophilosophy lessons, science and beliefs on the endless path of individual and human development, and other issues have been commented on [1-4].
  This work is dedicated to L. Discovering Carol's pedagogical tricks and presenting their educational potential as a means of teaching natural sciences through artistic creation, a pedagogical approach to knowledge integration.
The key principles of the author's pedagogy become visible from reading the very first lines of the fairy tale. what can be taught to teach a child, his subconscious need to understand life, to promote natural cognition, to ensure development.
 The author points out three important rules for solving this problem: 1) It is necessary to ensure diversity, fascination in the child's environment, to teach with familiar situations and characters, books and textbooks with aesthetic taste.
 ... but there was a picture, not a dialogue.
 "It's not a good book," thought Alice.
 Is it worth getting up to weave a wreath of identical pearl flowers [8, p. 11].
2) Being in an ever-changing environment will force the child to be surprised whenever he meets a new, unfamiliar person, and without surprise, his innate demand for human cognition cannot develop.
 When the rabbit took the watch out of his jacket pocket, Alicever jumped because he had never seen the rabbit wearing a jacket or watch, "out of curiosity", "ran from the rabbit" and without thinking jumped into the hole under the fence [8, p. 11].
3) For development, progress, it is possible to measure time accurately.
 The rabbit passed while talking. - My God, I'm late [8, p. 11].
  The rabbit is presented in the fairy tale as an agile animal with sharp hearing and sight, fast-moving, not strong, well-observed in all environments, with a large geography of distribution.
In different episodes of the fairy tale we meet other special pedagogical principles and tricks of the author, such as: The need to look at each issue from different angles in learning to develop the child's cognition, to pay attention to details, to repeat wisdom in developing beliefs, to analyze one's own experience, to use the experience of others, to cooperate, etc. [4]
The high degree of the author's natural knowledge cannot remain invisible in the "decoding" of the abundance of symbols.
  The class features of all biological organisms symbolize human characters and traits (as evidenced by the fact that they are represented in capital letters), which facilitate the understanding of the figurative meanings of the characters and the discovery of the mysteries and knowledge of the fairy tale.
Now let's present the interpretation of the selected episodes from the fairy tales and their symbols, point out the possibility of their application in the teaching of natural sciences, without delving into the interpretation of knowledge.
1) - You see, I will pass through the center of the earth.
 How ridiculous it would be to be among those who walk upside down.
 In my opinion, they are called Anti-Cretans [8, pp. 12-13].
The episode teaches one of the basic principles of natural science - the formation of mirror symmetry - the resulting causal notions of causality - will allow the child to conclude on his own that the conditions in different parts of the center of the earth (as in any event or object) are not the same It can be strange, mirror-like.
2) Suddenly Alice slipped.
 Թվ It seemed to him that the sea had fallen.
 "If it is cold, then I can return by train."
 Wherever you go along the English coast, you will always find removal booths, children digging in the sand with wooden shovels, furnished huts, and behind them a train station [8, p. 21].
This description of the English coast can be used as a parallel to teach the organic world ուղ the evolutionary path of human and individual cognition.
  Just as nature's mid-life began in water, then came out on land, conquering all its spheres, so in the course of human և individual development, primitive (sea-primitive knowledge) knowledge was accumulated, and then developed and enriched through self-education (furnished cottage-station). , sciences were created, then due to cooperation with like-minded people during the course of work and social maturation (train) they improved, matured, became progressive ideas and theories - the railway.
3) Unfortunately, there are no mice in the air, but you can catch bats.
  As you know, the bat and the mouse are similar.
 I wonder if cats eat bats [8, p. 14].
The episode can be used during evolution to learn the ability (divergence) to acquire (run-fly) various mobility devices through the divergence of traits of different living organisms (mice on the ground, bats are air mammals) during different stages of life.
4) a) What a strange feeling, 'cried Alice,' as if I were shrinking like a telescope.
 And really.
 He turned ten inches, և his face lit up with the thought that he could already go out the small door and into the picturesque garden [8, p. 16].
  (b) How do you like the Queen?
 Չի I do not like it at all….
 At that moment, Alice noticed Taguhi listening to the conversation.
 … Alice continued (changing the original logic of the word). - He plays so well that he has to give up immediately [8, p. 73].
Both episodes are suitable for teaching the following knowledge: in the process of evolution of a biological species, one of the ways of surviving in changing conditions (different organs of plants, different organ systems of animals, as well as a way for a developing person to adapt to the environment) is transformation.
5) I do not know who I am now, sir.
 I only know who I was this morning, but I have changed so much since this morning.
 … As you can see, I am not [8, p. 40].
It is a very convenient episode for the development of evolutionary thinking about the image of the world.
 It teaches that one of the basic properties of the Universe is motion, due to which everything is constantly changing, evolving.
  It is also suitable for teaching the property of heredity and variability inherent in all organisms, which are factors in ensuring the evolutionary development of organisms, contributing to the adaptation of organisms to new, changing environmental conditions.
6) It will lengthen one side of the mushroom and shorten the other [8, p. 43].
The episode presents the natural science knowledge that the mushroom is a biological organism endowed with dual properties, plant and animal, which can be used at the same time to teach that every aspect of life has at least two faces.
  It is also suitable for explaining the evolution of organisms that are transitional organisms (Euglena, colonial organisms, Archeopteryx, etc.) at the same time, having characteristics characteristic of different disciplinary groups.
7) a) Alice could not put her hands on her head, but she saw that she was curling in any direction like a snake.
 "You are a snake, a snake," whispered the dove.
- It seems that sitting on my hen is not enough, even now I do not have day and night because of those snakes.
 - I am not a snake, I am a little girl [8, p. 44].
 (b) "It looks like a real honeycomb," thought Alice.
 No, they are not bees, the bees do not swim a mile away.
 It soon occurred to him that what he saw was not a bee but an elephant, and he was taken aback by that thought [8, p. 137].
Episodes can be used to teach the inadequacy of the morphological criterion for the description of a species, as in orphanage they may be similar in appearance to unrelated organisms and therefore do not belong to the same species.
In this episode it is easy that K. Interpreting the reason for Liney's classification being artificial.
 And as the wisdom of life, the episode teaches only about the possible misunderstanding of the external appearance, the possibility of a wrong conclusion.
8) a) The dog growls when he is angry, and when he is satisfied, he moves his tail.
 I (Cat) growl when I am satisfied, և I move my tail when I am angry [8, p. 55].
b) But it may happen that he (the March Bunny) is crazy again, because now is May, or he is not as crazy as in March [8, p. 56].
c) When the sands are dry, he is as cheerful as a lark. Even the shark is terribly scornful and brave (it is a crayfish that can live in water, on land), but when the shark comes close to the current of the sea, His voice The belly falls and the heart trembles in fear [8, p. 89].
The episodes are suitable for artistically presenting the idea of ​​relativity of phenomena, such as the devices of the organism, when it is necessary to teach that 1) every earthly truth is relative, true only in a certain time and space; the true value of the phenomenon is always understood in comparison.
 2) For any environment, the organism's device does not protect it from enemies in other conditions.
9) They lived at the bottom of the syrup well, they ate only syrup.
 But it is not possible to eat only that, they would get sick.
 "It so happened that they became seriously ill" [8, p. 63].
 The episode is suitable for showing the adaptation of the organism to the limited conditions of the organism due to the narrow reaction rate of a characteristic trait, and which factor change increases the risk of extinction of that organism.
10) "The more I have, the less you have" [8, page 77].
  It is a very understandable word game for the whole, the law of conservation of matter, for the formation of the idea of ​​seeing everything in the universe in one whole, it teaches that each whole is a sum of large and small parts, each of which is irreplaceable in the whole.
11) Living organisms in a fairy tale symbolize a person who corresponds to the biological meaning of each.
  This approach, which is typical of a work of art in general, enables pedagogy to become aware of the need for the learner to understand nature well in order to understand life.
 Thus, 11-1) Alice, as a being at the top of the evolutionary ladder of the organic world, endowed with intelligence and cognition, acts as a symbol of those who have chosen the path of development, who want to improve indefinitely.
 By describing Alice's path, one can instill in the learner a sense of value for a good education.
a) "I can not do anything… I have never been so short.
 I confess, it is disgusting to be small (illiterate) ”[13, p. 21].
 b) This is a huge chessboard that covers the whole world.
 Անի I wish I had participated in that game,… as a Soldier, but I would have preferred to be a Queen [8, p. 132].
11-2) Pearl flower - a flower with a single, uniform petals As a plant, a non-moving organism.
 In the fairy tale, it is a symbol of the one who has no independent opinion, the one who has the opportunity to develop, which, giving birth to a negative attitude towards illiteracy, has the opposite effect, emphasizing the interest and importance of education and continuous development.
"Pearls are the worst."
 When one speaks, the others fall into it.
 It is enough to hear their voice, you will grow old >> [8, p. 129].
11-3) Lily of the valley - as a wild plant, it is more resistant than cultivated plants.
  Cultivars, as a result of artificial selection, unlike wild plants, can not survive in natural conditions without special human care.
 "Why do you speak so well?" Alice asked.
 … - Touch the ground with your hand, you will understand it in time.
 ... - The soil is hard, - but I do not understand what it has to do with the soil.
 "In some gardens the soil of the flower beds is softened," continued the Tiger, "and the flowers are constantly asleep [8, p. 129].
11-4) Caterpillar - the egg of an insect զարգացման is an organism of transitional stage և in the mature stages ում in the fairy tale, it is a symbol of a wise man who is well aware of different environments, past and future.
  Young Alice, who is coming to life and moving forward, is being taught many life lessons.
 For example, 1) you should go forward not on foot, but smartly. You were very fat, you were unusually fat, you were obese, you shook your head (moving your head forward), but you threw yourself out of the house.
 2) You should not spare anything to learn, even in the most difficult situation the mind will help to find a solution, and the most valuable is the applied knowledge. ։ A pair of bottles of two shillings, you will not regret buying it.
    3) Many things can be learned by discussing and analyzing what others have done. When I was still young, I liked to go to court (analyze the actions of others), and when I came home, I would occasionally tell my wife what I heard (listen to opinions, discuss).
  4) In some cases, in addition to intelligence, ingenuity, diplomacy այման definitely faith are useful: ես you are tough, sharp, but the eel (Snake with ingenuity, cunning, diplomacy, Pisces - faith) How did you hold the tip of your nose (Eel to keep, to use those features), where did you get so much intelligence and ingenuity?
  5) You should enter the environment only with deeds ... do not be so empty-headed, you should be so proud [2; 8 page 42].
11-5) Snail - a shell-like, slow-moving invertebrate animal, which in the fairy tale is a symbol of self-contained, limited possibilities, but a true connoisseur.
 "I can not hurry, ... it is very far, I do not want to and I can not dance with you" [8, p. 85].
"People are different in face," Alice remarked thoughtfully.
  - This is what I am complaining about, you all have the same face (society). Two eyes, a nose in the middle, a mouth below it.
 … If, for example, your eyes were on one side of your nose or your head was on your head (specialists with unusual sensory cognitive systems - musicians, painters, other creators, scientists, teachers, figures), I might remember you [8, p. 181].
The episode illustrates well the essence of the variational curve of modification, although it has a deep bio-philosophical meaning.
The idea of ​​the viability of the "golden mean" is true of all living organisms, as well as of humans, of the's small, unusual, unusual individuals, and of the non-viability (in the sense of paving their way into the environment).
 The society is mainly composed of the same faces, the "golden mean", but it can give birth to personalities, extraordinary people, who are destined to change the course of history.
  They will also be remembered in history.
13) "The lower my head is, the more things I invent" [8, p. 200].
This thought, which sounds like a false word, is manifested in the development of cognition, in the case of curiosity about nature, without special education, the possibility of discovering valuable truths only through the senses, of perceiving nature as a valuable textbook.
Unfortunately, it is beyond the scope of work to cover all the episodes of fairy tales.
 However, we hope that such an approach, as a teaching method, will allow not only in other episodes of this fairy tale, but also in any fairy tale to search and find multifaceted teaching, rich material, to use it according to the purpose.
