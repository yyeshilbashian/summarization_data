Immediately after the conquest of Alexandropol, the Turks created a new city autonomy.
 On May 17, by order of the Ottoman military command, the General Assembly of Citizens, chaired by the manager of the Trade Gymnasium, Leon Sargsyan, formed a city council, and the next day, a city administration.
 The city of Alexandropol, in the absence of national parties and other state institutions, became the only body that centralized all public and state affairs in the city-province.
The Turkish authorities avoided restoring the judicial system in the province of Alexandropol.
  Instead, on the fifth day of the siege of the city, they set up a police force, which for six months looted the occupied territories, hiding traces of Turkish atrocities and "exposing the atrocities of Armenians against Muslims."
Preface.
 1918 The history of the May heroic battles is one of the least studied issues in Armenian historiography.
 Dozens of memoirs and scientific monographs have been published in the homeland and the Diaspora during the past century.
  Huge documentary material on the square.
  Nevertheless, issues such as the occupation of Alexandropol province, the introduction of new administrative systems by the Ottoman authorities, the genocidal policy against the local population, the current ethnic disfigurement of the population of Shirak and Lori marzes, are not 1.
Combining newly discovered archival documents, scientific literature, and press releases of the time, we have made a separate study of the administrative policy adopted by the Ottoman authorities during the six-month war in the province of Alexandropol.
  In this way, we hope to turn this page of the criminal history of our neighboring state into public property.
1918 In the spring of 1945, the military-political situation on the Caucasian front of World War II changed dramatically to the detriment of the Armenian people.
  After the withdrawal of Soviet Russia from the war under the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Transcaucasian Seym tried to reach an agreement with the Ottoman Empire, but was unsuccessful.
 The Turkish-Transcaucasian war, which resumed on April 1, turned into a sword in 2018 as a result of the anti-Armenian stance of Georgian Tsatar figures in the region. Due to the 100th anniversary of the proclamation of the first Republic of Armenia,
Victory march of the Kaka troops.
 On the night of May 14, the Turkish command, which had become insatiable after the fall of Kars, demanded an extradition to Alexandropol.
After Kars, Alexandropol was the last bastion for the Armenian side to stop the Turkish victory campaign.
 Leaving the city meant handing over to the enemy not only the Alexandropol-Julfa railway, but also the whole of Eastern Armenia.
Without waiting for an answer to the ultimatum, on the morning of May 15, the Turks attacked the city after a brief bombardment, then the largest part of the province of the same name [22, p. 171].
The future Prime Minister of the First Republic of Armenia, not long ago the Mayor of Alexandropol Al. Khatisyan presented what happened years later in his work entitled "The Origin and Development of the Republic of Armenia" as follows: "While we were negotiating with the Turks in Patum on the terms of reconciliation, the Turks suddenly attacked Alexandropolivra and captured the city" [10, p. 73].
In terms of protection, on the eve of the ultimatum, Alexandropol was almost invincible. The official number of the garrison army alone was 506 officers և 5576 soldiers with 100 machine guns և 134 artillery pieces.
 In addition, the Armenian First Division, the Armenian Joint Military Unit, Andranik Military Unit, with a total of about 16,000 soldiers and 1,100 officers were stationed in the surrounding villages of the city [23, p. 622].
 General T. Nazarbekyan was in Alexandropol, colonels D. Bek-Pirumyan, A. Hovsepyan, Karakeshishyan, S. Samartsyan և others.
  There was even a 7,000-strong military unit in the Turkish offensive town.
In this case a logical question arises. How did the enemy manage to take the city without any serious resistance?
 Especially when it was already clear after Kars that the Turks were moving towards Alexandropol, everything had to be done to ensure the latter's defense.
Analyzing the secret of the Turkish victories, the "Caucasian Word" periodical wrote: "If we look closely, it will become clear that all the successes of the Turks, from Trabzon to Alexandropol, are not so much the successful conduct of hostilities in the true sense of the word, but the result of violations of international law of diplomatic intrigue" [25, p. 1].
  According to the newspaper, the Transcaucasian government, obsessed with defending the Georgian provinces at the expense of the Armenians, instead of retaliating against the enemy in the person of the Georgian Mensheviks, made regular concessions, forcing them to believe in the myth of their own invincibility.
  Here is an example of your behavior. Instead of keeping the troops of General Dei, who had arrived in Alexandropol after the fall of Kars, and filling the garrison of the city, the authorities sent them to Tbilissi.
The Armenian military command, which naively believed that the Turk Akhuryan would not pass, also had a share in the fall of Alexandropol [9, p. 2].
 It was unfounded and illogical for General M., known for his defeatist moods in the position of Commander-in-Chief. Areshyan's appointment.
It was this series of coincidences and criminal nonsense in 1918. May 15, led to the loss of the city.
 According to eyewitnesses, at the beginning of the attack the fortress garrison resisted, only in the first hour 180 Turks were killed (9 victims from the Armenian side).
The enemy had to stop the attack, sending a delegation and saying that "they do not intend to occupy the city (my Alexandropol-AH) or to fight against the people's militarism, why are you fighting in vain?"
 According to the decision of the conciliation deputies of Batumi, the railways have already been given to us, by which we will transport our troops to Julfa, we will stay in the station, without entering the city, without harming the military or the population "[24, pp. 1-2].
The resistance of the garrison garrison lasted for about three hours.
 After the Armenian troops left Alexandropol with them, most of the urban population left, and the rest of the people, at the suggestion of the fortress Yankovsky, sent a delegation led by Mkrtich Ghazaryan to the Turks, receiving guarantees of inviolability for life and property, and handed over the city [14, p. 51].
Interestingly, the small Muslim population of Alexandropol, as a regular Muslim population, tried to take advantage of the situation, sending an independent delegation to the Turkish command in the early morning of May 15, accompanied by two Greeks and an Armenian, to surrender the city without a fight [5, p. 2].
At that crucial moment for Alexandropol, the ruined city was left in a state of panic.
 Even the local leader, Archimandrite Artak, left Alexandropol (in a letter to Catholicos of All Armenians George V on June 3, 1918, Archbishop Artak tried to justify his escape: a) with the general panic and powerlessness that began in the city after General Nazarbekyan left. . 100 About 10000 rubles belonging to the government of Kars and Etchmiadzin. with the desire to save money) [11, p. 1013].
 Realizing his mistake, the latter returned a few days later and tried to get permission from the Turkish command to return the refugees to the city through negotiations.
  On the contrary, the members of the city council անց board moved to Tbilissi (Georgia), so that the city autonomy ceased to exist [16, p. 3].
The attitude of the people of Alexandropol towards the "native" authorities was best reflected in the press of the time.
 "The ARF fathers fled from the cities," the unknown letter correspondent who wrote to "Mshak" wrote, "taking with them the money of food and other institutions, viciously betraying the people in whose name they were tearing their throats so much."
  You should have seen what a curse the people were reading behind the ARF, what curses were heard addressed to its figures "[4, p. 2].
Realizing the temporary nature of their success, the Turks did not introduce an Ottoman system of government in the militarized province of Alexandropol.
  The leadership of the province had nothing to do with the Ottoman civilian authorities, and the governor (during the six-month war in Alexandropol province, Haidar Bey, Rashid Bey, Recep Bey, Rahim Bey (Rahim) Bey succeeded Kars, p. .
  The province was divided into village groups ությամբ villages headed by bash-mukhtars (senior village head) and mukhtars (village head).
The provincial center was divided into six more Mukhtars.
Immediately after the conquest of Alexandropol, the Turks restored the activity of city autonomy.
  On the second day of the siege of the city, May 17, by the order of the Ottoman military command, the General Assembly of Citizens, chaired by the manager of the Trade Gymnasium, Leon Sargsyan, formed a city council of 29 people (16 Armenians, 3 Greeks, 3 Muslims, 3 Russians, 2 Georgians, 2 Jews). 24-40, 1, pp. 283-300].
 The next day, the city council elected a 15-member executive by secret ballot from the city council, with 16 committees (sanitary, food, auditing, financial, listing, etc., maintaining relations with the authorities, etc.) [19, pp. 8, 17, p. 30].
The mayor of Alexandropol, L. was elected chairman of the city council. Sargsyan, assistants: P. Merkurov և H. Yusuf-OghliYusufov, secretary: Tsikhistov, translator: Mubayajyan [16, p. 5].
The provincial-administrative officials, the bash-mukhtars and the mukhtars, were placed under the jurisdiction of the city, as they were appointed by the administration at the suggestion of the Turkish command.
On May 19, the Turkish command recognized the legitimacy of the city authorities, and three days later, Vehib Pasha, who arrived in Alexandropol, met with the council members in the building of the Commercial Gymnasium (in the hall of the city council).
 The council submitted a petition consisting of 9 articles to the Turkish military commander, demanding to respect the inviolability of person, property and honor, to free citizens from the arbitrariness of Turkish officials, to stop looting, violence and falsifications, as allowed by Sargsyan . May 1919 June, 1919 Honored citizen of Alexandropol, June 3, 1919, June 1919 - Honorary citizen of Alexandropol. November 1920, Mayor of Alexandropol November 7-17, 1921 Chairman of the Alexandropol Regional Revolutionary Committee. From April 23 to mid-May, 1921-1922 in Kars, representative of the USSR, then in Tabriz.
About 120,000 Armenians who migrated from the Kars region to return to their homes [5, page 3].
On June 26, the city administration was reorganized, and all affairs were concentrated in five divisions under one general leadership: financial-economic (Ter-Martirosov), administrative (S. Ghazaryan), sanitary-medical (Tsikhistov), ​​technical (Chakhmasazov), and nutrition (Yusufov). , page 5].
In order to clarify the tax policy, a new body was created in August, chaired by the governor of Alexandropol, Idare Mejlis 1, consisting of four members of the city administration.
 During the next month, three main types of taxes were established: a. For pets, b. land and real estate և c. for trade and employment.
Finally in 1918. The RA diplomatic mission started its work in Alexandropol on September 4. Led by Khoyetsyan (the latter's reports provide exceptional information about the atrocities that took place in the province of Alexandropol during the Turkish occupation, the genocidal policy now applied to all Armenians).
  Before the departure of the Turkish troops, the representation became a mediator between the Armenian "Ottoman authorities".
 [2, pp. 112-149].
In fact, during the Turkish rule, the Alexandropolik Autonomy became the only body in the absence of national parties and other state institutions, which concentrated all the public affairs not only of the city but also of the province, while acting as a mediator between the "Turkish command" and the pro-Turkish forces. to ensure its physical existence.
"Urban autonomy," wrote the administrative council of the Armenian diplomat in Alexandropol under the governor of Ottoman Turkey, which included two representatives from the Muslim and non-Muslim populations.
 The council discussed administrative, financial, public, agricultural and other issues.
Representative G. In one of his reports submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Khoyetsyan raises motions with many successful results on issues that, being of state importance, cannot be subject to his authority "[19, p. 8].
The priority task of the newly created city authorities became the return of refugees and the tax burden.
The department organized grain purchases [17, pp. 8-9, 19, p. 11].
  To meet the needs of the population, particularly the bread consumed in 1918. On July 26, the city council set up a commission to organize a bakery, and then proceeded to take the money of the Alexandropolibank taken to Tbilissi by the members of the former board, amounting to Rs 1,200,052. to return to the case [16, p. 103].
 The financial problems between the old and new city authorities were settled only in 1918. In September, after L. Sargsyan, who arrived in Tbilissi (Georgia) at the request of L. Sargsyan, the RA diplomatic representative in Georgia A. Jamalyan [16, pp. 103-104].
The fight against epidemic diseases became a matter of concern for the city autonomy.
  Steps were taken to invite doctors from Yerevan, Tbilissi (Georgia), bury the bodies of cholera victims in special places, and open hospitals for the treatment of venereal diseases [15, p. 62].
 Attempts were made to revive the school work by bringing back the Alexandropol teachers who had fled to Tbilissi (Georgia) [18, p. 26].
Thanks to the steps taken by the local authorities, life in the city has gradually returned to normal since June. Canteens, restaurants, hotels, catering centers and shops have reopened.
Contemporaries praised L. during the six-month Ottoman war. The activity of the structure headed by Sargsyan.
In particular, the RA diplomatic representative in Alexandropol G. Khoyetsyan in 1918 In a report sent to the Foreign Ministry on December 4, he wrote: "When the former administration left the city and everyone else was looking forward to the near future, Լ Mayor L. Sargsyan և M. Ghazaryan 1 1 only to help the people who were left headless, to the extent of their strength, remain in the city.
 What they owe in these six months… their endurance, their strong և brave protest against all that was beyond their competence և wider in nature, the selfless defense of the people's interests, because of which they have been persecuted and even endangered their lives … Their self-sacrifice, honesty, strength and courage only awaken in me a sense of deep respect։ ”[13, pp. 90-96].
The Turkish authorities persistently and persistently avoided restoring the justice system in the war-torn province.
  Although Vehibpaşa promised to establish a court in response to the city's appeals, conditions were even worked out (the Turkish side appointed the president of the court, the prosecutor և the investigator, the city's sovereignty to the other members of the court), but the judiciary did not work.
 For the whole six months, those accused of serious crimes were sent to Kars, and the light crimes were investigated by the Commission for the Investigation of Legal Disputes of Citizens under the City Autonomy [19, pp. 9-10].
Instead, the Turks set about creating a new police system with great vigor.
  According to contemporaries, on the morning of May 16, the Turkish command appointed patrol groups to ostensibly maintain order in the streets and neighborhoods of the city, but in fact to make the mass robbery official [4, p. 2].
 Four more days later, a mixed Turkish-Armenian police force of 50 people was formed, the so-called "Aji Tabuli" (Hunter 1 Ghazaryan Mkrtich Minas (1867-1919), studied at the Department of Archeology at the University of Strasbourg.
 Moving to Eastern Armenia, he taught the Armenian language at the Shushi seminary.
 After some time he moved to Alexandropol, was appointed the manager of the Arghutian school, then the supervisor, and in 1918 In May-December, he was a member of the Alexandropol city administration, chairman of the immigration committee of the city autonomy.
 He died of typhus in 1919. He was buried on January 16 in a cemetery called the Hill of Honor.
Dakan Battalion-AH), whose Muslim members were armed with mosin և bullets, and the Armenians as traitors, by the order of Sh ևk Pasha only with mosin [24, p. 2].
Khatun-oghli Mahir Bey, one of the former beys of Shoragyal, was appointed the head of the provincial gendarmerie of Alexandropol.
  In addition to indulging in sexual harassment with his gang every night at the expense of the citizens, this robbed the remaining houses.
 So, when in 1918. Vehib Pasha, who arrived in Alexandropol on May 22, 1945, met with members of the city council, whose first demand was to get rid of Mahir Bey.
  The Turkish commander stated that "all Ottoman military officers are" Kulicha "(refined-AH) gold, they are not capable of committing crimes" [5, pp. 2-3], however, a few days later Khatun-oghli Mahir Bey was dismissed.
  The Kurdish Tahib Bey, who replaced him in the post of gendarmerie chief, "ended the plunder of the Armenian population with his cunning games" [6, p. 2].
Hundreds of innocent people were arrested for false betrayal and suffered horrible tortures in Kars prisons for months.
 Many disappeared, others were shot, not knowing what their crime was.
  About the activity of Alexandropol gendarmerie G. Khoyetsyan wrote in his messages. "A constant disgrace has taken place here, which is famous.
 By giving a bribe, it was possible to force the landlord to sell it to the Tatar without payment, it was possible to kill a person, injure him, and then arrest the injured person.
  Money disputes are especially easy to resolve.
The head of the gendarmerie called the debtor to him, ordered him to pay the debt and send him away, then put the money in his pocket.
 And this lasted for a whole month ”[20, pp. 94-95].
1 Major General of the Pasha-Ottoman Army, born in Kharberd, 1918 From the spring the commander of the Kars front, the right hand of Enver Pasha.
 It became known to the world in 1916.
He was awarded the Order of the Holy Cross by the German authorities for his exceptional endurance and courage against the Russian troops in Golitsa.
He was nicknamed "Turk-Hindenburg" in the army.
The investigation of rural affairs լուծ The solution of the problems of the villagers was assigned by the city administration to the priest Ter-Grigoryan.
  A man who was ready to use any means to solve the people's problems.
  For his selfless work, Ter-Grigoryan was hated by the Turkish authorities, especially the police.
  He was arrested on false charges and sent to Kars prison, then beheaded in an abandoned trench without trial.
  The same fate befell the poet Nikoghayos Tsitoghtsyan.
  He was arrested on the pretext of taking him to Kars, then he was killed by gunshot wounds in the car.
  Mutafyan, Hekimyan, Tigran Shekoyan and others were imprisoned for months in Kars prisons without serious charges [5, p. 3].
The periodical press of the time is full of stories about the horrible crimes committed by the Turkish police in Alexandropol.
  For example, "The governor of Alexandropol, Rahim Bey, seized the furniture store of Uzbashian's house, where a million items of iron, construction, paint, and chuan steel were stored," Atrpet writes.
After returning to the city, Harutyun Yuzbashyan demanded that the Turkish authorities return his property, was immediately arrested for fraud, accused of espionage, and then deported [8, pp. 4, 20, pp. 41-42].
In the first days of the siege of the city, the Turkish command demanded that the citizens hand over their weapons, and threatened those who disobeyed with shooting.
  Guessing the real purpose of that order, the people of Alexandropol immediately handed over the main part of the weapon through the city council.
  As a result of further searches, no weapons were found among the population, so the gendarmes went to their favorite occupation - stealing.
  Village searches generally turned into unbridled looting [24, p. 2].
After the Ottoman army entered Alexandropol with the active support of the same gendarmerie, the Tatars, who had filled the city, opened the houses and shops of the departed citizens and appropriated their property [7, p. 2].
Often, as a result of police machinations, entire villages were deprived of their settlements.
 For example, Adiyaman was inhabited by Muslims who migrated from the province of Yerevan.
  In response to requests for the return of the village to its rulers, the head of the gendarmerie stated that "the Adyamans are deceitful people, and the Tajik government has always had a fair attitude towards the Armenian subject people" [21, p. 61].
In another case, when the body of a Turkish soldier was found on the road to Horom, the police sent a cavalry with a cannon to Horom to punish the villagers without conducting an investigation [20, p. 70].
During the six months of its existence, the police tried to hide the traces of Turkish atrocities.
 The people of the war-torn regions were forced to write letters of thanks and give false testimonies, the priests were forced to present the victims of the mass murders as victims of natural disasters, and the victims of torture were presented as drowned by lice.
  At the same time, the police collected documents that would show the post-war world the "atrocities" of the Armenians against the poor Muslims, and would justify the retaliation of the Tajik government [21, pp. 60-61].
Conclusion.
  Summing up 1918 A brief examination of the administrative policy pursued by the Ottoman authorities in the province of Alexandropol in May-November, let us mention the following. The Turks did not introduce Ottoman rule in the war-torn regions.
Immediately after capturing the city to give a "legal" look to its own illegalities, the Turkish command restored the activity of city autonomy.
 By the same principle, instead of restarting the justice system, the Turks created a police structure, which was called not so much to maintain order, but to hide the traces of their own crimes.
