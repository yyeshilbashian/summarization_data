Upon enrollment in school, educational activities become a leading activity for the child.
  According to academician A. According to Leont, the leading activity in which the essential mental processes և the development of essential personality traits take place, which characterize the key stage-by-stage achievement of age development.
 According to him, "Educational activity is a socially significant, compulsory, evaluable activity, thus it is fundamentally different from all the types of activities that the child used to do in pre-school institutions or at home" [6].
The flood of information has affected all segments of society, including primary school students.
  Living in a modern environment, it is impossible to drive away television, newspapers, magazines, movies, radio, the Internet.
    Often, family upbringing does not pay attention to what the child watches on TV, what he wears with headphones, what games he plays on the computer, what literary characters and movies he prefers.
 Or why it, no one else.
  Most often in this area the child is independent, not yet formed with self-awareness, because he is impressed, he is often influenced by the media.
 "The freedom of a child does not mean a state of abandonment, on the contrary, the correct perception of freedom, instead of our fantasies, brings the real needs of the child, leads to real, real care for the child.
  Our modern child enjoys only physical freedoms. ”[1]
In the 20th and 21st centuries, all spheres of human life have been invaded by the mass media, the latest technologies. All these elements are of great importance in the formation and socialization of a person's value system.
 It is a well-known fact all over the world that the first places in the mass media are occupied by television and the Internet.
 So, we will study some of their features related to aesthetic perceptions, aggressive expressions և values.
The value system of children has not yet developed enough to adequately perceive the displayed phenomenon.
 Heroic aggressive actions on the screen are often considered "insignificant" compared to his victories.
 These actions take root in the child, which later becomes difficult to correct, unchangeable.
  Most children can imitate the behavior of any hero or presenter in a matter of seconds, saying what they learned from the media.
 But, unfortunately, there are negative elements in the information that children can get by pressing a button or opening the Internet.
 Aggressive tendencies of children are more often noticed by parents.
 Many parents are concerned about the influence of television and other media on their child's behavior.
 How to prevent the child's consciousness from being clouded in that difficult situation, from damaging his mental state, from harming his physical health.
  These other similar situations were the basis for choosing our topic, which is a very topical issue nowadays.
The goal is to reveal the connection between the aggression of the primary school students and the "media".
 Tasks: • Analyze the interrelationship of Internet and television information և Aggression of primary school students • Conduct a theoretical analysis on the nature of child aggression և Classification. • Choose diagnostic tools. • Parents at home, teachers at school, work to ensure that the child's eyesight is not damaged • Encourage adults to pay attention to their behavior when interacting with children • Help parents with advice.
The mass media is an institution created for open public programs.
It is a relatively independent system with its content, means, tools, methods and a certain level of organization.
"One of the characteristic features of a primary school student is their emotional arousal.
 The teacher's touching words, bright colors, the movie he watched, the story he read completely captivate and absorb the children.
 On the contrary, the long and boring dry verbal narration makes the instructors tired, distracts them, and the horror movies they watch, the programs intimidate with aggressive actions, leave a deep impression on the further upbringing of the child. [4]
The flood of modern information has become a factor in the formation of a child's personality.
 From the first years of his life he appears in the information field, where he already establishes communication by communicating.
  An interaction occurs between the information environment կառույց the structure of the growing generational value orientations։.
 This relationship between the environment և subject և is contradictory in nature, as the components have a complex structure.
  On the one hand, they learn to use violence, they spoil their eyesight, they waste time, on the other hand, they are brought up with the help of education, computer games and programs, which develop their worldview, opening new horizons of life.
  This culture gives an opportunity to meet new people, other cultures.
 Statistics show that special children's programs occupy about 5% of the airtime, while 5-10 years ago it was 30%.
 There are only a few thematic programs of cartoons left.
  The rest of the time the children watch the same programs as the adults.
The horror films with horror programs are being sharply criticized by pedagogues and social workers.
 They find that these scenes make the child cruel, aggressive.
 While this debate is going on, do the military actions and scenes of violence shown on the screen have a negative effect on the children?
  Thus, statistics show that [7] the most popular TV channels show about seven facts of physical aggression every hour - nine facts of verbal aggression.
 And a child who spends about two hours on TV sees at least fifteen cases of aggression.
  And it is not accidental that this topic is of great interest in pedagogical-psychological science, it has great social significance.
Studies have shown that "school-age children spend 3-4 hours a day in front of the TV, which is equal to 5 lessons."
  What do children manage to see during those hours: three scenes of violence and murder, in which there are unjustified behaviors by the society (use of drugs, tobacco - one sexual scene).
  Will not all this affect the child's consciousness?
  After all, after graduating from school, there will be about eight thousand murders and ten thousand scenes of violence.
 An American prisoner was once asked if television could teach new criminal tricks.
 8 out of 10 answered that question positively.
 To the next question, 3 out of 10 answered that they tried to commit a crime, being guided by the tricks they saw in the film.
  Another study showed that watching programs with scenes of violence caused aggressive behavior in children.
 Such children are several times more likely to commit offenses than those who do not enjoy watching such programs. ”[8]
Why do children become more aggressive?
  Such a psychological feature of a child is known. As a rule, it is easier for a child to imitate the actions of an adult than to delve into its permissibility.
 If a child crosses the street in the wrong place, he will do so in adulthood, knowing that it is wrong, because it penetrates his consciousness, strengthens it, it is not subject to correction.
  In the same way, watching an aggressive scene leads not only to aggressive behavior, but also to emotional insensitivity.
 The child becomes less responsive, cold, less anxious about the pain and suffering of others; watching aggressive scenes at the age of 7-8 can predispose the child to aggression at the age of 17-19.
 For this reason, it is necessary to advise those who are pregnant to ban aggressive programs, movies, and their number at an older age.
  It is also possible to limit or reduce the number of hours spent at the TV with the whole family և on the computer և to spend them more efficiently.
In order to understand what are the circumstances of a child համար which վախ cause fears, it is necessary to know that the growing child assimilates the environment, regardless of whether it is peaceful or warlike.
 As the child grows up, he goes to school, gradually the connection with the parents weakens, շրջ the period of difficulties in the upbringing begins.
 Parents can not follow the behavior of children who express their morbid desires or fears in the embodiment of aggressive animals, and at a slightly older age watch horror movies for adults.
A 6-7 year old child, watching TV, accepts the information more deeply, has feelings of joy and fear, his psyche can be in a strong arousal or inhibition.
  For example, enjoying the scenes of murder and violence, he feels a reproach from the side; unconsciously, under the influence of hypnosis, he voluntarily gives control of his mental process to television.
 Communicating with the whole world through the screen, he finds something valuable for himself, including the ideal of his existence.
 For some elementary school students, they are superhumans, brave policemen, socio-political figures, and for others, famous film actors, sports masters, pedagogues.
 He believes in his ideal, considers his words and actions to be true, and begins to follow his principles.
 The effect of such an ideal gives great inspiration from the screen.
 Children are not ready to respond appropriately to the information received from the screen.
 Scientists have found that only 60% of parents try to explain the scenes of violence shown on television.
  And 40% do not give any importance to the content of the program watched by the child.
  On the playground, one can often witness how the winner hits the loser with pleasure, and before, it was enough to catch the opponent to recognize himself as the winner.
 The reason for this is that the junior high school students, not having enough consciousness, consider what they have seen to be real.
 The same aggressive attitude is used in school.
  It is pointless to keep the primary school student away from the TV, the parents just have to control what the child is watching.
From all this we can conclude that in modern conditions the level of aggression shown by the primary school student is influenced by the information they receive (what they hear and see from the TV, from the computer).
  Children take this aggression to school, apply it at school, showing aggressive attitude towards teachers and friends.
  Not to mention that the child sits for hours in front of computer games, damaging his eyesight, not watching any educational program, not contributing anything to the development of his own knowledge, abilities, value system.
  "Every third person in the world sees badly.
What is most disturbing is the increase in short-sightedness of primary school children, which mainly results from reading while lying down, poor lighting, sitting in front of the TV or computer for a long time, inconvenience at the desk, etc. [3]
  At home, parents, at school, teachers should pay serious attention to children exposed to the media և use appropriate moments during lessons, using accurate examples to explain the harms of horror movies, such programs, computer և Internet abuse.
 "According to Vygotsky և his followers, regular education can really affect the mental development and upbringing of a child.
  To this end, they suggest that teachers actively intervene.
  According to them, the provision of certain materials in the relevant educational environment is not enough to stimulate this development. "[2]
 / These are all problems with their solutions /.
Leaving the analysis of the data, one can advise parents և teachers.
1. To follow the formation of the established order of behavior during the upbringing.
a. To form a versatile and harmoniously developed individual who will satisfy the public demands.
b. It is very unfortunate that neither the state nor the family has decided how much time the child should spend in front of the TV.
Adjust yourself.
c. Social experience has shown that the child's constant presence in front of the screen is interrelated with his emotional sphere, his intellectual abilities, physical data, including the deterioration of vision d. The main methods of regulating this process can be a conversation with other educators, child psychologists about the harmfulness or usefulness of this or that program.
  Demonstration of the positive and negative sides of the story by personal or public example.
 In the form of games, it can be didactic, developing, at the same time educating computer or television educational programs; 2. Gradually the child should learn to take the positive from the Internet և from the screen.
3. Parents should follow the scientific innovations, read literature on various educational directions, including aggression.
4. It is very important to have a mutual understanding with the child, what to look at, when to look, for how long.
 The child imitates the parent, the teacher in any way, their image develops in him.
