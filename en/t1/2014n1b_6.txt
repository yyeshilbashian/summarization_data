The peculiarities of the Carno dialect are presented in H. Mkrtchyan's work "The Carno dialect" [5], but over the years, the dialects have undergone many changes.
 Vocabulary changes are associated with the development of life, science, and economics, and the influence of literary language on grammatical changes is enormous, as school and literature increase the level of education, bringing the grammatical forms of dialect orthography closer to the norms of literary language.
In the article we have studied, presented the changes that have taken the live speech of the people, we have tried to show the phonological peculiarities of Shirak idioms.
In order to present more clearly the relations of the dialects of Shirak region, we have divided Shirak region into 4 territories: 1. Central or Gyumri area, which includes the city of Gyumri with several rural settlements in its vicinity: Mayisyan, Vahramaberd, Kaps, Marmashen, Hatsik, Shirak, Arևik, Hovuni, Aygabats, Arapi, Gharibjanyan.
 It is in this area that the dialect of Carno dialect Leninakan has been preserved, which was studied by H. Mkrtchyan.
 Taking into account the fact that today Leninakan is called Gyumri, therefore we find it expedient G. Replace the name of Leninakan dialect used by Jahukyan with the dialect of Gyumri.
2. North-Eastern կամ Southern or Artik-Maralik area, which includes more than 65% of Shirak region: 22 rural settlements of Artik region, 17 rural settlements of Ani region, 25 rural settlements of Ashotsk region, Artik-Maralik cities.
As few Armenian dialectologists have studied the dialects of this area, ում The Institute of Language of the National Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Armenia has notebooks registered on the dialects and sub-dialects of only a few settlements of this huge area (Azatan, Tsoghamarg, Getk). In Jahukyan's multi-characteristic classification, "this area is not separated as a dialect-speaking place, but is automatically included in the Leninakan dialect of Karnobar dialect, so we will conditionally call it Artik-Maralik dialect և we will try to show the dialectal expressions and their manifestations."
3. Armtyan or Voskehask area, which includes Voskehask, Haykavan, Voghji, Meghrashat settlements.
 In the territory of Shirak region, in Voskehask, in several surrounding settlements, the Mshobar dialect has been preserved, so we will consider the presence of the Voskehask dialect of the Mush dialect characteristic for this area.
4. North-western or Amasia area, which includes the following settlements of Amasia region: Amasia, Gtashen, Zarishat, Alvar, Berdashen, Ardenis, Aghvorik, Zorakert, Tsaghkut, Garnarich, Shaghik, Aregnadem, Byurak, Bandivra, Hovtor.
 These immigrants from Akhalkalaki settled in these settlements after 1988, who brought with them their dialects, which we will conditionally call the dialects of the Amasia area.
Thus, according to the above, from now on we will single out: 1. Gyumri dialect of the central area, 2. Artik-Maralik dialect dialects, 3. Voskehask dialect of the Western area, 4. Northwestern or Amasya dialects.
The examination of the phonetic features and peculiarities of the speeches in question proves that the dialects of the Shirak area have their own peculiarities, which characterize the living speech of today's Shirak.
 Our task is to describe the current state of Shirak dialects, to reveal the relations, penetrations and interactions of dialects in the sound system.
In several publications we have presented the phonetic features of the problematic discourses [2,3].
 We will now try to show the manifestations of dialectal features in order to find out the correlation between the phonetic parallels of the dialects.
Based on the manifestations of dialect features in Karno և Mush dialects, G. The data provided by Jahukyan [3], the linguistic facts recorded by the researchers in Karno և Mush dialects [1, 4.5] "Our observations on the dialects of Shirak area, we will try to show the main և essential differences of the dialects of my area"
In order to get a clearer picture of the relations between the dialects of the Shirak area, we will present below the multi-characteristic classification tables of dialects, with the help of which we will try to find out the ratio of the phonetic parallels of the dialects.
The tables show G. The data of Mush, Karno և Leninakan dialect centers on the multi-characteristic classification of Armenian dialects made by Jahukyan, next to which we will present the dialect features of the Gyumri dialect, Voskehask sub-dialect, Artik-Maralik "Amasia dialect areas". 1, 2 /.
 The columns we fill in the tables are given in italics.
In the tables, the ratio of pluses to minuses will be more obvious.
The observed expressions in the consonant system have the following differences / see salt. 1 / .1 / 1 /. In the dialects of the Amasia area, the loud explosions and half-words at the beginning of the word show a characteristic of suffocation, in contrast to the other dialects of the area.
 Of course, we have marked this feature in the tables with the + ̅ sign for the territory of Amasia, because the dialect units of Akhalkalaki, communicating with other dialects of Shirak, acquire the suffocating sound of loud explosions, which is one of the most characteristic features of the dialects of Shirak.
2/4 /. After և in the phonetic and semi-phonetic positions of the consonant and the ending of the word, the vocal explosives and semitrailers have the characteristic of suffocation in the dialects of the area of ​​Amasia, in contrast to the other dialects of my area, in which in the above positions they turn into simple deaf consonants.
3/11 /. The initial change of T before the vowels n, r, r, which was typical of Karin's dialect, is absent in the dialects of the Shirak area.
 Գ. Jahukyan marks the relative change of t with +1 for the dialect places of Karin և Leninakan + before the vowels r / r / r /.
 Today this feature is registered only in Amasia, where there are dialect units of Akhalkalaki.
4/13 / .The feature of the communicativeness of the semi-speakers in the pre-consonant position / j, j, ch, dz, ts, ts ~ j, sh, z, s, s / is present today in the dialects of Gyumri և Artik Maralik area, while this feature is found in G. Jahukyan mentions - for both Karin and Leninakan dialect places.
5/17 /. At the beginning of the word, the presence of a lip joint / f / in front of h before G. Jahukyan mentions Karin և Leninakan.
  We have excluded this feature for Gyumri, and we have marked Artik-Maralik with + համար for the dialects of the Amasia area.
6/24 /. The preservation of the consonant n (b'er, lamb, bride), which is absent in almost all dialects, exists only in Voskehask, which is due to the fact that the order of occurrence in the mentioned sub-dialect operates only in n.
Now let's try to single out the general features that are typical of all the dialects in my area.
 They are 8.1 / 2 /. The loud explosions and half-sounds of the beginning of the word show the feature of suffocation.
2/6 /. After R խ the deaf explosives and semicircles in the consonant and post-consonant positions of the word end.
3/7 /. Non-verbal breathing deafness is de-breathing.
4/9 /. In front of the sound connection there is yn / stand-stand /.
5/14 /. The presence of y at the end of the word in front of H / / bahb'ay, border-sayman /.
6/15 /. At the beginning of the word (before the vowel) the presence of additional breath in front of the h (especially the vowel h), moreover in both native and borrowed words.
7/21 /. The presence of F is indicated by a + ̅ sign for all the dialects of the area (land-foil, hon-phon, fand, so-and-so).
 8/22 /. Among the phonetic parallels, the 22-character is remarkable, which is related to the ambiguity of r և the changes related to it.
 Գ. Jahukyan rules out the appearance of this feature in the columns of the dialect centers of Karin and Mush և Leninakan.
However, referring to the peculiarities of the phonetic system of the dialects of the Shirak area, we have already spoken about the pronunciation features of r [2, p. 68], so we have marked this feature with + for all the dialects.
It is clear that the dialects of the Shirak area have more in common than differences in phonetic systems.
Phonetic features / parallels / Phonetic featuresKarinLeninakan Mush Gyumri Voskehask ArtikAmasiaMaralikTable 1.According to phonetic features, the comparable speeches have the following differences.1 / 26 /. The dialects of Gyumri և Artik-Maralik area (this> es, father> father) have the first vowel / e / in front of the accented ay, and in the sub-sub-dialect of Voskehask there is ay / this / this /, and in the dialects of Amasia - ay> a / this-as, father> har /.
2 /41/. In front of the stressed a it is only in the sub-subdivision of Voskehask, which i / write> g'erim, place> tigh, back> hid /.
Only two of the phonetic features are common to all the dialects of the Shirak area.1 / 32 /. Addition of y before the initial e of monosyllabic words / Yezn-yez, kur-yep /.
2/33 /. Addition of the lip element before the initial o of monosyllabic words oh-vokh, orphan-vorp /.
It is clear from the data in Table 2 that the phonetic parallels of the speeches are fewer.
 This is due to the influence of the modern literary language, due to which there are no wind vowels in the territory of Shirak today, there are no two-dialects, the accented-o does not have a rising-two-dialect pronunciation, etc.
The above features / 29, 30, 31 / C. Jahukyan marks with + for both Leninakan and Mush, but today in Shirak those features are missing / see salt.2 /.
Table 2. Phonetic features / parallels / Phonetic featuresKarinLeninakanMush Gyumri Voskehask ArtikAmasiaMaralik Now let's try to compare the general և distinguishing features of dialect centers based on the data in the tables.
Karno dialect վածք The dialects of the Amasia area have 8 / 4,6,7,9,11,14,17,21 / common և 4 / 2,3,5,22 / different consonants, 2 / 32,33 / common և 2 / 26.34 / distinctive phonetic features.
Karno dialect and Artik-Maralik dialect have 8 common consonants / 2,6,7,9,14,15,17,21 / և 3 / 4,13,22 / distinctive, vowel 2 / 32,33 / total և 2 / 26.34 / distinctive features.
Now let's compare G. The data presented by Jahukyan are the tables of Leninakan զուգ conclusions compiled by us about the dialect centers of Gyumri.
  The following image is recorded in the tables. Leninakan and Gyumri have consonant 7 / 2,6,7,9,14, 15,21 / total և 5 / 4,11,13,17,22 / distinctive, 3 common vowels / 26,32,33 / և 4 different / 29,30,31,34 / parallels.
From the examination of the parallels of the subdivision of the Mush dialect սկ Voskehask, it is seen that the above-mentioned have 7 common consonants / 2,6,9,14,15,19,21 / և 5 differential / 4,7,13,22,24 /, 2 common vowels / 32 , 33 / և 6 distinct / 26,29,30,31,34,41 / parallels.
Summing up our observations, we can imagine what kind of relations և the dialects of the Shirak area have mutual penetrations, ինչ what changes the living speech of the people has undergone in the sound system over time.
  In general, we can say that the phonetic system of the dialects of Shirak is characterized by the absence of wind vowels. cՙ, d̔, dՙ̔, jայթpaytական և half-loudspeaker sounds, in the speeches r the vowel functions not as a primary language, but as an interlinguistic consonant, which is accompanied by a weak haggard breath.
