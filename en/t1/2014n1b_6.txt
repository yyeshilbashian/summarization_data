The peculiarities of Karno dialect are presented by H.In Mkrtchyan's "Carno Dialect" [5], but over the years, the dialects have undergone many changes.
 Vocabulary changes are related to the development of life, science, economics, and the impact of literary language on grammatical changes is huge, as school, literature andraising the level of education contribute to the dialects andThe grammatical forms of the speeches approach the norms of the literary language.
In the article we studied և presented the changes that:We tried to show the modern life of Shirakthe phonetic features of the speeches.
The relations of the dialects of Shirak area are moreIn order to clearly present, we have divided Shirak region into 4areas:1. Central or Gyumri area, which includes the city of Gyumri with several rural settlements in its vicinity: Mayisyan, Vahramaberd, Kaps, Marmashen, Hatsik, Shirak, Arևik, Hovuni, Aygabats,Arapi, Gharibjanyan.
 It is in this area that the Carno dialect is preservedThe speech of Leninakan, which was studied by H. Mkrtchyan.
 Given:The fact that today Leninakan is called Gyumri, so we consider it expedient. Replace the name of Leninakan dialect used by Jahukyan with the dialect of Gyumri.
2. North-Eastern և Southern or Artik-Maralik area, which:It covers more than 65% of Shirak region, 22 of Artik regionrural settlements, 17 rural settlements of Ani region, 25 rural settlements of Ashotsk region, Artik and Maralik cities.
Because few Armenian dialectologists have dealt with this areaAccording to the speech examination, իտ The Institute of Language of the National Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Armenia has notebooks registered on the speech and sub-speech of only a few settlements of this huge area (Azatan, Tsoghamarg, Getk), andin Armenian dialectological works, especially G. Jahukyan said
This area is not separated as a dialect-speaking place, but is automatically included in Carno.In the dialect of Leninakan of the dialect, therefore, we will conditionally call the dialects of Artik-Maralik area, we will try to show the manifestations of dialect features, their relations andreciprocal penetrations.
3. Armtyan or Voskehask area, which includes Voskehask, Haykavan, Voghji, Meghrashat settlements.
 In the territory of Shirak region, in Voskehask, in several surrounding settlements, Mush has been preserveddialect, so we will consider the presence of Voskehask dialect of Mush dialect as characteristic for this area.
4. North-western or Amasia area, which includes the following settlements of Amasia region: Amasia, Gtashen, Zarishat, Alvar, Berdashen, Ardenis, Aghvorik, Zorakert, Tsaghkut, Garnarich, Shaghik, Aregnadem, Byurak, Bandivra, Hovtor.
 These settlements have been settled in Akhalkalaki since 1988the immigrants who brought their speeches with them, whateverWe will conventionally call the dialects of the Amasya region.
Thus, according to the above, from now on we will single out: 1. Gyumri dialect of the central area, 2. Speeches of Artik-Maralik area, 3. Voskehask dialect of the Western Territory,4. Northwestern or Amasya dialects.
Examination of the phonetic features and peculiarities of the dialects in question proves that the dialects of Shirak have their own peculiarities, which characterize them.is the living word of today's Shirak resident.
 Our task is to describe the current state of Shirak dialects, to reveal the relations, penetrations and interactions of dialects in the sound system.
We have presented the issue in several publicationsphonetic features of speeches [2,3].
 We will try nowshow the manifestations of dialectal features to find out the correlation of phonetic parallels of speeches.
Based on the manifestations of dialect features in Karno և Mush dialects, G. The data provided by Jahukyan [3], the linguistic facts recorded by the researchers [1, 4.5] in Karno և Mush dialects և
We will try our observations on the dialects of the Shirak areashow the main տարբեր significant differences in the dialects of my areaև Present the real relations of dialect units.
The relations of the dialects of Shirak area are moreIn order to have a clear idea, we will present dialects belowMulti-character classification tables, with the help of which we will try to find out the correlation of phonetic parallels of speeches.
The tables show G. The data of Mush, Karno and Leninakan dialect centers on the multi-characteristic classification of Armenian dialects made by Jahukyan
We are Gyumri dialect, Voskehask sub-dialect, Artik-Maralik ևDialectal features of the dialect-speaking areas of the Amasia area/ see salt. 1, 2 /.
 The columns we fill in the tables are given in italics.
In the tables, the ratio of pluses to minuses will be more obvious.
The observed expressions in the consonant system have the following differences / see salt. 1 /.
1/1 /. In the dialects of the Amasya region, the loud explosions and half-words at the beginning of the word show a characteristic of suffocation, in
unlike other dialects of the area.
 Of course, we have marked this feature in the tables with the sign + համար for the area of ​​Amasia, because the dialect units of Akhalkalaki, communicating with other dialects of Shirak,acquire vocal explosives և semicircles at the beginning of the wordShortness of breath, which is one of the most characteristic features of the dialects of Shirak.
2/4 /. After R և consonantal and ending consonantal
The loud explosions and semicircles in the positions have the characteristic of breath-deafness in the dialects of the area of ​​Amasia, in contrast to the other dialects in my area, in which in the above-mentioned positions they turn into simple deaf consonants.
3/11 /. The relative change of T before the vowels n, r, r,
which was typical of Karin's dialect in the dialects of Shirakis absent.
 Գ. Jahukyan to the dialect places of Karin և Leninakan
Denotes by +1 the relative change of t from n, r, r vowelsforward: կր՜ռ / ռ /.
 Today this feature is recorded only in Amasia,where there are dialect units of Akhalkalaki.
4/13 / .The feature of the communicativeness of the semi-speakers in the pre-consonant position / j, j, ch, dz, ts, ts ~ j, sh, z, s, s / is present today in the dialects of Gyumri և Artik Maralik area, while this feature is found in G. Jahukyan mentions - for both Karin and Leninakan dialect places.
5/17 /. At the beginning of the word before o in front of h lip lip / f /
the presence of G. Jahukyan mentions Karin և Leninakan.
  This:We have excluded the feature for Gyumri, and Artik-Maralik ևWe have marked + for the dialects of Amasia area.
6/24 /. Preservation of the consonant n / b'er, ghar,
The bride, which is absent in almost all dialects, is present only in Voskehask, which is also due to the fact that the existence ofThe procedure operates in the mentioned subsection only with n article.
Now let's try to single out the common features that:They are typical of all the dialects in my area.
 They are 8.1/2 /. The loud explosions and half-sounds of the beginning of the word show the feature of suffocation.
2/6 /. After R և consonantal and ending consonantal
The deaf explosives and semi-explosives in the positions are loudare.
3/7 /. Non-verbal breathing deafness is de-breathing.
4/9 /. In front of the sound connection there is yn / stand-stand /.
5/14 /. The presence of y at the end of the word in front of H / / bahb'ay, border-sayman /.
6/15 /. Extra breath at the beginning of the word (before the vowel)
Existence of (especially the vowel h), both native and borrowedin words.
7/21 /. The presence of F is indicated for all dialects of the area
with + ̅ sign / land-fog, hon-fon, fand, filan /.
 8/22 /. Among the phonological parallels, the 22nd is remarkable
attribute related to the ambiguity of r և related to itchanges.
 Գ. Jahukyan rules out the appearance of this feature in the columns of the dialect centers of Karin and Mush և Leninakan.
However, referring to the peculiarities of the phonetic system of the dialects of the Shirak area, we have already spoken of the pronunciation of rabout features [2, p. 68], so we have mentioned this feature+ for all speeches.
It is clear that the dialects of the Shirak area have more in common than differences in phonetic systems.
Sound features:/ parallels /Phonetic featuresKarinLeninakan Mush Gyumri Voskehask ArtikAmasiaMaralikTable 1.Comparative speech by phonetic featureshave the following differences:1/26 /. In front of the accented ay, the dialects of Gyumri այս Artik-Maralik area (this> es, father> herr) have the first line of vowels / e /, and in the sub-subtext of Voskehask there is ay / this / this /, and the area of ​​Amasia
in the speeches: այ> ա / այս-աս, հայր> հար /.
2 /41/. It is only in the subtext of Voskehask that the accent a is pronouncedThere is / write> write, place> place, back> head /.
Only two of the phonetic features are commonfor all the dialects of Shirak area.1/32 /. Addition of y before the initial e of monosyllabic words / Yezn-yez,
when-yep /.
2/33 /. Addition of the lip element before the initial o of monosyllabic words oh-vokh, orphan-vorp /.
It is clear from the data in Table 2 that the phonetic parallels of the speeches are fewer.
 This is due to:under the influence of modern literary language, with which in the territory of ShirakToday there are no wind vowels, no dialects, no accentsե-ն և ո-ն have no rising-bilingual pronunciation և etc.
The above features / 29, 30, 31 / C. Jahukyan marks with + for both Leninakan and Mush, but today in Shirak those features
are absent / see salt.2 /.
Table 2.Sound features:/ parallels /Phonetic featuresKarinLeninakanMush Gyumri Voskehask ArtikAmasiaMaralikNow let's try to compare the general ընդհանուր distinguishing features of dialect centers based on the data in the tables.
Karno dialect ունեն The dialects of the Amasya region have 8/ 4,6,7,9,11,14,17,21 / total և 4 / 2,3,5,22 / different consonants, 2 / 32,33 /general և 2 / 26,34 / distinctive phonetic features.
Karno dialect and Artik-Maralik dialect have 8 common consonants / 2,6,7,9,14,15,17,21 / և 3 / 4,13,22 / distinctive, vowel 2/ 32,33 / total և 2 / 26,34 / distinctive features.
Now let's compare G. The data presented by Jahukyan are the tables of Leninakan զուգ conclusions compiled by us about the dialect centers of Gyumri.
  The following is recorded in the tables:the image. Leninakan and Gyumri have consonant 7 / 2,6,7,9,14, 15,21 /
total և 5 / 4,11,13,17,22 / distinctive, vowel 3 total / 26,32,33 /և 4 different / 29,30,31,34 / parallels.
Mush dialect և Voskehask sub-syllable parallelsIt is clear from the examination that the above-mentioned have 7 consonantal commonalities/ 2,6,9,14,15,19,21 / և 5 distinctive / 4,7,13,22,24 /, vowel 2 total/ 32,33 / և 6 distinct / 26,29,30,31,34,41 / parallels.
Summing up our observations, we can imagine what kind of relations և the dialects of the Shirak area have mutual penetrations, ինչ what changes the living speech of the people has undergone in the sound system over time.
  In general, we can say that the phonetic system of the dialects of the Shirak region is characterized by the absence of wind vowels.Of the 30 consonants in modern Armenian, they use the breath sound b, c, d, dz, jExplosive և semi-lyrical sounds, in speech r the vowel functions not as a primary language, but as an interlinguistic consonant, whichAccompanied by shortness of breath.
