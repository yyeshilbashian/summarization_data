Timeliness.
 Depending on the time, social conditions, the level of development of the country, the views of the society, preferences բավականին values ​​of life have undergone considerable changes.
  Since the main force for the socio-economic progress and development of each state is the healthy generation, the use of health by the post-ethnic population is considered to be one of the leading issues of the country.
By guiding the rising generation to a healthy lifestyle, it is necessary to identify their attitude towards the "health" value.
 The earlier the knowledge and skills on strengthening and maintaining health are developed, the more realistic it will be to improve the health of the population.
As an integral part of the educational process, "assessment of the values ​​of life" is included in the "Healthy Lifestyle" section of the "Physical Culture" subject program of RA secondary schools [1].
 These values ​​have been compiled by the specialists of UNESCO նախարարության Ministry of Republican Party of Armenia, which include 10 values ​​of life (material security, favorite occupation, freedom, family, health, education, healthy environment, happiness, homeland, love և love).
Based on the above, the goal was to reveal "The value of life by high school students."
The following issues have been resolved for the implementation of the above-mentioned issue: 1. to reveal the "health" value assessment by high school students, 2. make a comparison between the values ​​assessed by rural "urban high school students".
The research methods are: • study of literary sources, generalization և analysis, • sociological survey.
Based on the issue, a questionnaire was conducted among about 200 bisexual students in the villages of Bambakashat, Pambak, Ar-ik, and Yerjan high schools.
  The participants of the research evaluated the 10 values ​​of life according to their ability (Table 1).
Aghyusak1.KYANKI ARZHEKNEREREVANIGYUGHERIASHAKERTNERASHAKERTNERENTANIKKRTUTYUNAZATUTYUNHAYRENIKSIREL AND SIRVELNYUTAKANAPAHOVVATSUTYUNERJANKUTYUNAROGHJUTYUNAROGHJ SHRJAKAMIJAVAYRSIRATS ZBAGHMUNKHartsman awarded to the cost of "family" aravelaguynushadrutyan by graduate students, 29 students in Yerevan, and 19% of school children in rural areas were selected as the most important value.
 It all starts with the family: the upbringing of the child, human relations and knowledge of the world, so the stronger the families, the healthier and more moral the children will be.
 Taking into account the attitude of schoolchildren to the use of the "family" value of healthy families, the registered indicators are considered positive.
Out of 10 values, the second dimension in the capital is occupied by "education" - 20%, and only 14% of rural high school students are elected as the leading value.
 Taking into account the age of the respondents, as well as the requirements of today's work and life in general, which dictate the advantages and benefits of higher education, it can be said that the value of "education" is at an average level.
Much attention was paid to the highest percentage of rural students - "freedom" (23%), and in Yerevan it is quite low - 3%.
 Interviews with rural children revealed that limited family rights, neglected yards, and lack of leisure, arts, and sports facilities were the reasons for children's uninteresting and incomplete organization of their daily lives. , one that will allow them to have exciting and fulfilling days.
 Unlike them, urban dwellers do not have such a problem.
The value of the "homeland" gives food for thought, the latter received 8% of attention in the villages and in Yerevan.
  From ancient times the main value for an Armenian has been the homeland, the independence of its defense, which has always been emphasized in the system of physical education, where the main ideology is to prepare versatile and harmoniously developed citizens who will be ready for work and defense of the homeland.
 The value of life is directly proportional to age.
The individual, living in different periods, perceives and appreciates the same value in a different way.
 Subsequent results show that the transition from adolescence to adolescence still does not allow to have a realistic idea and correctly assess the world around them, as they are in a difficult period of orientation of profession, work and education.
The age of high school students also speaks of the vivid expression of their emotional imagination, from that point of view the value of "to love" is at a proper level.
  Both in Yerevan and in the villages 11% were registered.
The next value, "material security", was mentioned by 5% of the residents and 7% of the villagers as the leading value of life.
 It is commendable that our schoolchildren are not so much materialistic, but we can not deny the fact that one of the main obstacles in the life of our society in modern times is related to material problems.
The next value, "happiness", was mentioned by 8% of the students in the city and 4% in the villages as the primary value.
  For one, having a family is happiness, for another, a secure life, the third considers itself happy only by being loved, and the other thinks that only with all the above-mentioned values ​​can one be completely happy. This is a debatable issue, because everyone understands the concept of "happiness" differently.
As for the main value of our survey - "Health", it turned out that both in Yerevan (10%) and in the villages (11%) did not receive special attention.
According to existing data, [2] diseases are the leading cause of death in Armenia.
  Cardiovascular diseases are in the first place, and cancer is in the second place.
  The third platform is shared by diabetes and respiratory diseases.
 In general, 65-70% of the deaths in a year are men.
 The quoted sources state that it is connected with the unhealthy lifestyle of men.
 It should be noted that according to the statistical data of the Government of the Republic of Armenia for 2014, 17.5% of the population of the Republic of Armenia is physically inactive, and 49% is obese and obese.
 The prevalence of daily tobacco use (50% among men, 2.3% among women) and alcohol abuse (15% among men) is high among the population [3].
 The above facts և the results of the survey once again prove that the health issues of the population should be one of the problems of the state, as only a person with strong health can work well, have a healthy generation, dedicate himself to the homeland, succeed in various spheres of life.
 The last two values, "Having a favorite occupation" և "Healthy environment", have not received decisive attention from our students.
Conclusion.
 Thus, it can be concluded from the recorded results that in order to properly assess the "health" of the population in order to improve and maintain its health, it is necessary to educate them with appropriate knowledge, to develop appropriate skills for leading a healthy lifestyle.
 All this is purposeful to start from an early age, while studying in public schools.
As for the significant difference in the assessment of the life values ​​of rural and urban students, it is necessary to improve the conditions for organizing entertainment for rural children (installation of sports equipment in yards, creation of arts, sports and other entertainment centers).
 It will naturally contribute to their correct perception and appreciation of the values ​​of life.
