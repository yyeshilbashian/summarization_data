The Aragats massif is an important tourist attraction, that is whyIts relief for summer-winter recreation has been assessed.
At the same time, the severity of winter conditions was assessed.
In many cases, not knowing the potential of the area,Tourists do not visit the region, which stops the development of the region.
In view of the above, a recreational assessment of natural conditions becomes necessary, which will allow to study ներկայացնել to present to the public the possibilities of organizing recreation in the given region.
The natural conditions of the area in question are quite goodstudied, but they are not made from a recreational point of view.
They are relatively well studied in the Aragats massifThe historical monuments located in the lower zone, which mainly restrict the visits of tourists.
  Within which most of the monuments are up to 2000 m high,above which only unregulated mountaineering routes are carried out.
The purpose of this article is to show և evaluate the recreational opportunities of the highlands of Aragats massif, how to map them.
Study methodology.
 Selecting the Aragats mass as:object of study, we meant several circumstances.The first of these is the lowlands of this or that massifIt is already used as a recreation area.
Second, the natural landscapes of the highlands (above 2000 m) are little altered by humans, it has a variety ofrelief.
The development of evaluation methods is based on the principle that:Each type of recreation has a certain "requirement" of natural complexes.
 Taking into account this circumstance, we have assessed the summer recreational opportunities of the Aragats highland part of the walking-aesthetic type, as well as skiing.for sports.
The combination of summer and winter rest is weakwill increase the economic of recreational facilities in the regionprofitability.
Organizing summer vacations in areas higher than 2000 mis performed for physically healthy people for a few daysThey can stay at such heights.
  Needed for this purposewill assess the terrain of the area on which they are directly conditionedpermeability, climate training, as well as the aesthetic perception of the area.
It is difficult to cover the evaluation of all components in one article, so it is advisable to present onlyrelief assessment methodology.
The nature of the mountainous terrain is a potential resource for recreational activities.
  By studying the latter as a recreational resource,Many scientists have been engaged [1; 2; 3].
During the recreational assessment of the relief, the quantitative assessment of the relief indicators becomes more important, on the basis of whichWe can say in what direction of recreation this data can developregion [4].
In the case of such works, these are the most important indicatorsvertical և horizontal fragmentation, slope slope ևposition.
Taking into account the above, we have calculated the dimensional indicators of the relief of the studied area1.
50,000 scalebased on a topographic map.
 Moreover, the calculation was made 2000 mfor a region that extends higher than the horizontal.
According to the cartographic data, Aragats is within the mentioned bordersThe area of ​​the mountain mass is 944 km2.
 Given the fact that the massif has the appearance of a cone, which we are studyingThe area is divided into 4 sections (sectors): northern, southern, eastern and western.
  The division is conditional վել doneBased on the directions built from the top of Aragats.
  Moreover,they are drawn in such a way as to coincide with certain backgrounds.
 For example, the northern part of the area is enclosed from the top to Harichalong the line leading to the settlement, which crosses the Mantash River valleyIn the direction leading to Nigavan.
  Within such borders, the northern part occupies 192 km2.
 The largest area is occupied by the southern slope, which is enclosed from the top to Artashavan և Davtashenbetween the leading directions.
 It covers an area of ​​296 km2 or is under study31.3% of the area.
Table 1 presents the altimeter data of the study area.

  We used an embedded to get the latterformula, which looks like this:where S is the total area of ​​the section, S1 is the isolated area of ​​the dimensional index of the relief (in this case, the slope of the slopes).
Based on the data in Table 2, it can be argued that the slope slopes of 1015 ներից predominate in all sections, which is most appropriate for the development of walking tourism.
They have a large surface area with high coefficients of 15-25Sloping slopes, which occupy the largest areas of Aragatsin the southern part (211 km2), the total coefficient is 0.88.
  This:The slopes are more expedient for the development of ski tourism.
The opportunities are smaller in the Aragats massiffor the development of mountaineering, as the slopes with a slope of more than 40˚They occupy an area of ​​only 79 km2 and have a total coefficient of 0.33.
In order to make full use of the recreational resources of Aragats, it is necessary to use the winter opportunities as well.as a stable snow cover is formed from the height of 2000 m.
1 The meter shows the area in km2, declares the suitability coefficient.
SSK1 In view of this circumstance, it is necessary to present also the severity of the winter weather in the highlands, whichIt is a necessary precondition for the safety of tourists.
There are many methods for calculating the severity of winter conditions [5; 6; 7], of which Aragats massif winter
Bodman was used to assess the severity of the conditionsthe calculation method, which looks like this:where T is the air temperature (˚C), V is the wind speed (m / s).
The assessment based on the Bodman index is performedaccording to the scale presented in Table 3.
Calculated by the method proposed by BodmanData from several observation points on the Aragats massif,The results of which are presented in Table 4.
Table 3. Bodman scale for winter weather for description:Stiffness index (points) S:Less than 1Terms:Weather:Description:MildNot strictMedium severityStrictMore severeVery strict6-largeExtremely strictThe analysis of the data in Table 4 allows us to say that:At the altitudes of 2000-2300 m, the Bodman index changes in the range of 2.1-2.5, which is characterized as a medium intensityconditions.
Comparing these indicators with the data of relief slopes:It can be said that winter conditions, especially winterThe conditions for organizing rest are sufficient.

 Combining:relief indicators according to the Bodman index data, we can say that:It is not expedient to use the highland zone of Aragats massif (above 3000 m) for winter recreation.
 This:The conditions of the zone are more favorable for summer rest (pedestrians)routes, geotourism, ecotourism), as well as in the presence of significant slopes of the terrain - mountaineering or mountaineeringfor.
According to the researches, it was compiled by usSchematic map of recreational nature use of Aragats massif,which is presented below.
Conclusion.
  Based on researchIt can be said that it has the Aragats massif in generalFavorable conditions for the development of recreation.
  Moreover,From 2000 m to the top of the mountain range, the conditions are sufficient for summer recreation.
In addition to hiking trails, it is possible to arrange hereRest related to geotourism, mountaineering and mountaineering.
Up to 3000 m are more favorable for winter recreationHypsometric heights are areas where BodmanThe index has small indicators.
