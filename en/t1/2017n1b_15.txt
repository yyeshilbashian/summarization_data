Preface.
 Scientific and technological progress, the introduction of high technologies and modern trends in the development of society have made urgent the task of reforming the education system and the need to implement programs aimed at improving its content [1].
As a result of the reform, the main high schools were established, a student-centered concept of education was formed, and educational standards and programs were changed.
 All this had a direct impact on the essence and significance of science education, its content, ways of organizing, teaching methods.
  In connection with that. The problem of increasing the quality and effectiveness of teaching physics in secondary schools received a new sound, one of the main ways to solve which is the continuous improvement of science subjects, including the content of physics teaching and its teaching methods, in schools, especially in high school.
 In high school, with the help of advanced physics curricula, it became possible to apply methodological principles consistently in the teaching process.
One of the basic methods of scientific knowledge in physics is the method of similarity (yield) [3,4].
  Proper use of the material in the learning process makes the writing of the material scientific and accessible, at the same time contributing to the development of learners 'ability to think independently and logically, to deepen the studied questions, and to develop students' ability to apply theoretical knowledge in practice.
 However, this similarity can in some cases lead to far-reaching conclusions, as studies have shown, misleading not only students but also some teachers.
  That is why the correct choice of the methodological principle of physics in solving physical problems can be of great practical importance, which is the reason for the urgency of the work.
The aim of the work is to show by the example of solving specific problems that the application of the methodological principle of similarity is not always expedient, moreover, a precise and at the same time similar analogy can lead to incorrect conclusions.
Let us now present the solution of two specific problems using the methodological principle of similarity, for the second of which, through simple physical analysis, it is proved that the application of this methodological principle to it is not expedient.
Problem 1. The girl has to go straight out of their house ùëÜ1 ’´÷Ä’•’∂÷Å away from their house.
From which point of the stream should the girl take water so that the distance she has traveled is minimal?
Solution. use the methodological principle of optical-mechanical similarity. The trajectory of the motion of a particle in a potential force field ÷á In an optically inhomogeneous medium, the flow of light is similar.
Fig. 1. Positions of the girl ÷á's grandparents' houses in relation to the river In general, the girl can take water from the parts of the river outside the different parts of the river, but it is obvious that if she takes it, her journey will be longer than if she took it from the parts of those parts.
  It is clear that the road will be short in case of a girl's straight movement, ’≥’°’∂’°’∫’°÷Ä’∞ such roads may be, for example, roads passing through points.
 However, or at least the condition of the road will be fulfilled for one of such points inside the site.
Optical-mechanical similarity helps to solve the problem in a short way.
  Consider the optical problem similar to our problem.
 For example, the point of light at the place of the girl's house falls on the flat mirror surface placed in the place of the stream, reaching the point where the grandmother's house is located (Fig. 2).
 According to the law of reflection of light, the angles of reflection are equal, the point ÷Ä the image is at equal distances from the mirror.

Fig. 2. Reflection of a light beam from a flat mirror surface Returning to the problem of carrying water to a girl, it becomes clear that from the point (Fig. 3), in order for her passing girl, the water should be at a minimum.
Problem 2. Can the full current of a section connected in parallel to an electrical circuit, as the sum of the currents of its branches, be compared with the corresponding currents of water?

MAMAÔÄΩ'12AA12AMAM Solution. Let us use the principle of similarity, according to which, just as the amount of water flowing in a stream in an unbranched stream in a given period of time is equal to the sum of the amounts of water flowing in its individual streams in the same period, so the total current of an electrically connected circuit is equal to the sum of its currents.
 It is known to the students from everyday observations that in case of closing one of the parallel streams, the flow of water in the other branch will increase, it will be equal to the flow of the unbranched part of the stream.
  The learner can conclude that if one of the two lamps connected in parallel is switched off, all the previous current will pass through the other lamp, which will cause it to light up brighter.
 The reason for such an erroneous conclusion is that in the case of a constant voltage at the site, the magnitude of the circuit current is determined by the magnitude of the connected resistance.
 Let us clarify these judgments in fig. By the example of the chain shown in Figure 4.
For the sake of simplicity, let us assume that the resistances of the lamps correspond to each other, then the total resistance is equal to the currents of the branches. If we turn off one of the lamps, say, the third, the currents of the individual branches will not change in case of constant voltage.
 In that case, the students may ask what happened to the part of the full current that passed through the third lamp.
 By simple calculations it can be shown that after switching off the third lamp, the total resistance of the parallel station increased, depending on which, in case of constant voltage, the full current of the station decreased by.

IIIURÔÄΩÔÄΩÔÄΩU3I3I If the voltage of one of the lamps was switched off in parallel with the increase of the resistance of the station, the voltage of that station would also increase, the currents of the branches would increase.
 This is possible when the internal resistance of the power supply is of the order of resistance of the outer part of the circuit, or the electrical circuit contains other consumers in addition to the parallel-connected station.
 For example, suppose a DC-6 type AC rectifier is used as a power source in a circuit with an output voltage of 6 V, a maximum allowable current of 2 A, and an internal resistance of Ohm [6].
 In parallel with that source, connect two lamps with parameters of 3.5 V ÷á 0.26 A, followed by a rheostat with maximum ohm resistance.
 First we will determine the resistance of the lamp, then the parallel section, we will have Om ÷á Om.
  Then let's determine the voltages ÷á currents in different parts of the circuit.
  According to Ohm's law, for a chain current, the voltage drops will be equal in different parts of the circuit: 2.5 V on the parallel section, 2.1 V on the rheostat, 1.4 V on the internal resistance of the source.
 The currents passing through parallel branches are equal to each other ÷á separately are 0.175 A.
 It is easy to notice that the lamps, which are designed for 0.26 A current, will light up with less than normal brightness.
  Now turn off one of the lamps and again determine the full current of the circuit in case Ohm, we get I = 0.25 A.
Since this current already passes through only one lamp, it will be brighter than when 0.175 A current was passed through each lamp of the parallel section.
 It is easy to show that in this case the voltage drop across the lamp unit will be 3.5 V, and the voltage drop across the internal resistance of the rheostat ÷á current source will be smaller than in the previous case.
 Thus, we make sure that when one of the lamps connected in parallel is removed from the circuit, the other lamp lights up brighter.
 This phenomenon will not be observed in practice if U4rÔÄΩ06RÔÄΩ13,513,50,26RÔÄΩÔÄΩ6,75RÔÄΩ00,35.

 condition.
 If this condition is met, the voltage drop across the circuit will remain almost constant, and one of the lamps will illuminate with constant brightness if one of them is removed from the circuit.
 It is due to this condition that the brightness of the other lamp does not change when one of the lamps connected in parallel is switched off.
 Thus, summarizing the above judgments, we come to the conclusion that in this case the branching of electricity should not be completely equated with the branching of the river, that is, it is not right to make such a similarity.
By the way, the question of the expediency of using the similarity method can be discussed with the similarity of the classical examples in the school of physics, such as the formulas of gravitational-electrostatic fields, electromagnetic-mechanical oscillations, expressions of their energies and paragraphs.
  Of course, the analysis of these mentioned similarities will make the picture more complete, as a result it will be possible to avoid misunderstandings and will help the students to form the correct scientific thinking and worldview.
