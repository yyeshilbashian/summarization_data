The aim of the article is to interpret the interactions of the formation of national identity and national geopolitical ideas from the position of modern methodology of social geography.
 It is obvious that these concepts, with their complexity and multi-layeredness, first force us to interpret the modern aspects of the scientific understanding of the concepts separately, after which it will only be possible to discover the interactions of the latter.
  Accordingly, we can formulate the logical subcategory of the research problems singled out in the article: Recognizing the activities of the actors determining the potential of the Armenian geopolitics, • Identifying the interrelationship between the formation of national identity and geopolitical ideas, based on the need to clarify national priorities.
For the solution of the problems we have chosen as a point of view the social geography - spatial, systemic, spatial-temporal research approaches.
 And their special complexity obliges to use both symmetrical methods of analysis, comparison, theoretical generalization, as well as specific geographical, comparative-geographical, balance, geographical scientific description methods.
Interpretation of the issue of national identity is one of the key և complex issues of modern theoretical research.
 However, stable traditions of problem solving have not yet been established in domestic scientific circles.
 This is primarily due to the fact that the scientific school inherited from the Soviet regime, under the influence of objective "subjective factors", lacked research on our ethnic identity.
  After independence, an attempt was made to fill this gap, but due to the lack of a solid scientific basis, publications on national identity, with a few exceptions, were often distinguished by unprofessional, sometimes pathetic formulations.
 It is noteworthy that in our country the pathetic overestimation of national identity goes hand in hand with the same pathetic underestimation of identity.
 As a result, a polarizing debate arises on the topic, during which it is impossible to understand what the objective characteristics of the Armenian national identity are. [5]
Modern tendencies in the organization of public life, globalization and transnational processes, align (have leveled) the value orientations of individuals և social groups.
 With the influence of the geopolitical, socio-economic and cultural transformations taking place, new types of societies are being formed - new identities.
 As a consequence, changes are taking place in the traditional approaches to the collective self-consciousness of societies.
It is with this circumstance that some experts justify the activation of the identity discourse, acknowledging that in response to the ongoing processes of revision and redrawing of group boundaries, efforts to preserve one's own group boundaries are intensified, and ethno-defense mechanisms are activated.
In modern theoretical research, the key question of ethnic identity is to reveal its essence, that is, to accept ethnic self-consciousness as a subjective desire or an objective demand.
  By accepting each of them as a scientific paradigm, research results in opposite results.
 The basis of this scientific dilemma comes from the contradictory approaches to the modern definition of the concept of "nation" in general [3, pp. 46-48].
In general, it should be noted that there are two approaches to the concept of "nation" in modern professional literature.
One of them, conventionally called "French", is based on the voluntary choice of nationality and is directed against the ethnocultural interpretation of "nation".
 According to this concept, the objectivity of the notion of "race" is denied, therefore no state or nation can be considered homogeneous from an ethnocultural or racial point of view.
  They have all been formed on the basis of the constant mixing of different social groups, living in the same area, they have changed each other.
The next concept, which is circulated in the professional literature as a "German" direction, is based on the biological or cultural concept, where the key is the objective principle.
 According to that, the nation is considered as an objective society, which is composed of members belonging to the same group.
 And the group, depending on the specific situation, can be defined as united on the basis of language, blood, race!
 However, whichever way the group is defined, the affiliation of people to this or that nation is determined in advance. ԸնթացքումTime can not be denied.
The first is defined as the nation's civic, and the second as ethnic or cultural concepts.
  Moreover, the basis of the first concept is the territorial right of the people, and the second is the right of blood.
In our previous research, addressing the issue, let us note that subjective desire stems from genetically based objective demand.
 Therefore, in our opinion, the discovery of the problem of identity is not so much conditioned by the subjective desire to satisfy ethnic aspirations, but by the objective demand for the correct, full realization of one's own potential at the collective and individual level.
 Because for the fullness of the ornate, ethnic satisfaction is not a complete but a crucial component.
Thus, ethnicity remains one of the most important forms of group identity, which provides և nourishes the beginning, the individual's feeling of being rooted, connected to them, the feeling of psychological security և stability.
 In this sense, ethnos is presented as an individual as a psychological community, and ethnic identity is one of the founding characteristics.
 People, naturally, regardless of their "location", try to identify with their own ethnic group; on the contrary, the difficulties of building a positive ethnic identity cause problems both at the interpersonal level and in intra-group inter-group relations.
The basis for such an assertion is the fact that almost all national units, even those for which national preservation is not a priority, express some concern about transnational processes threatening their own ethnic identity.
The need for urgent research on the problem in the pan-Armenian reality is first of all reflected in the fact that the majority of the Armenian nation lives outside the homeland, forming a strong Armenian Diaspora.
 And for the nations with Diaspora societies, the problem of self-preservation is more than acute, because there is a dichotomy in the main, visible-expressive criteria of nationality (language, religion, culture, perception of the homeland).
In other words, in parallel with the objective factors of identifying with the same ethnic community (genealogical commonality, genetically transmitted codes of worldview, etc.), there are obstacles to their effective realization in the form of non-cohesive language thinking, cultural values, spatial perception of the homeland.
 Let us add that the self-categorization of an individual is expressed not only by ethnic, but also by social and civic identity.
 Consequently, for Armenians living abroad cut off from the Armenian environment, foreign social and civic identities affect ethnic self-consciousness.
 For Diaspora Armenians, the national "we" does not become the only one, as they must objectively identify with other "us", other civil-social, non-national groups.
 Therefore, the key criteria for the expression of national identity - language thinking, faith, culture, perception of the homeland - state, remain only in the emotional realm, become a desirable but not mandatory aspect of behavior.
 And this, in turn, forces us to look for simpler mechanisms for the expression of national identity, the satisfaction of the objective requirement of the national component of individual fullness, which among Armenians is expressed by anti-Turkishness.
 It is obvious that there are certain objective elements for the formation of the latter.
 In particular, the factor of the Genocide, the scattering of Armenians around the world, and the absence of an independent Armenian statehood at the same time can be considered objective preconditions for anti-Turkishness to be chosen as the main means of expressing national identity.
 It became a key criterion of preservation of the Armenian identity in the Diaspora.
 Moreover, anti-Turkishness had its impact on the expression of national identity, mentality and nationalist moods in Soviet Armenia.
The problem should have changed radically in the case of newly independent Armenia.
  The restoration of the independent Armenian statehood should have become the only axis of the expression of the national identity, because, in the opinion, only in the case of the statehood does the society acquire the characteristic features of the nation as the highest level of development of the human society.
  The absence of statehood, depriving an ethnic group of the opportunity to fully realize its own potential, makes it a lower sub-unit: a people, a nation, but not a nation.
Thus, the first criterion of the expression of the Armenian national "we" is the real connection with the Armenian statehood.
 That is, for the national identity, the sensual perception of the homeland must have a specific geographical (spatial) expression1.
  Therefore, the criterion of each individual being Armenian will first of all be expressed by the size of the real connection with the Armenian statehood.
 According to that, we can define heredity as an objective condition for being Armenian, and the connection with statehood as a subjective precondition for expressing Armenianness.
Other criteria of national identity - linguistic thinking, culture, faith, traditions, etc., as they are viable only in the case of the primary criterion - national statehood, then they become necessary for national identification, but not sufficient 1 Special emphasis that by statehood we mean only Armenian geographical space The Armenian statehood based on it, because, as history shows, in the powerful centers of the Diaspora, forms of independence and even statehood can be formed.
  However, they can only provide a temporary effect, even hindering the formation of a natural Armenian statehood.
condition.
 The latter are the tools for the realization of the ethnicity of the individual, the largest social group, the nation և derive from objective and subjective preconditions.
Defining such a subset of the criteria of national identity արմատ rooting in public consciousness and behavior will provide an opportunity to neutralize the dangerous moods that exist today (and throughout history) in our reality.
  In particular, outside the Armenian statehood, even with the observance of visible standards of national self-consciousness, it is possible to fully express the Armenian essence.
 In this way, at the subconscious level, it will be possible to prevent emigration and stimulate emigration.
Besides, it will be possible to direct the realization of the national potential to the strengthening of the Armenian statehood, which in its turn will raise the formation and realization of the national geopolitical ideas to a qualitative norm.
In previous researches [3,190-320], referring to the content of the Armenian geopolitics, we have stated that we consider it a useful tool to discover the adaptation opportunities of our country in relation to the geopolitical processes taking place.
If we follow the general logic, then "in the past, now" geopolitics is considered in the public perception as "the science of mastering the territory."
 It is obvious that such a formulation refers not only to the possession of new territories, but also to one's own.
 Consequently, each subject of the world political map will willy-nilly formulate his own system of geopolitical ideas, which can summarize only the necessary means of owning his own territory, and in the case of highly potential subjects, also the formulation of geopolitical ambitions.
Let us add that the current level of development of the world society proves that the possession of territories is expressed not only by physical confiscation, but also by ideological, cultural, moral, economic and other expansions.
 And this implies that the traditional approaches to the object of geopolitical research և research methods are being revisited.
 In other words, the latter have become very comprehensive in terms of content, including modern means of organizing public life and possible levers to influence them [3, p. 201].
Thus, practical geopolitical research will provide an opportunity not only to discover the adaptive potential of our country to geopolitical processes, which is also very important, but also to assess the ability of our country (including the Armenian nation as a whole) to influence those processes.
 In this case, it is necessary to formulate the framework of national geopolitical ideas, where the priorities of the activities of the Armenian geopolitical actors must be clearly expressed1.
According to that, the activity of the classical actors of the Armenian geopolitics - the Diaspora, the church, the army - should be aimed at strengthening the Armenian statehood.
  In other words, the Republic of Armenia should act not as a separate link in the chain of Armenian geopolitical actors, but as the only sphere of activity of those links.
  In order to effectively develop, realize and express national geopolitical ideas, it is necessary to strengthen the Armenian statehood, the realization of which, the manifestation of appropriate behavior, should be considered a priority criterion of national identity.
Summarizing the results of the research, we can state: • The modern tendencies of globalization make the discourse of the problem of national identity more demanded in scientific researches today.
  This is conditioned not only by the national-subjective subjective desire, but also by the individual-group 1 In geopolitics, among the actors are all the individuals, groups and structures that "develop, express and put into action the geopolitical desires and ideas."
 For details on actors, see [3, 7, 8] at the level of the need for internal objective (inherited) claims.
• The real connection with the state is considered a priority in the delimitation of the criteria of national identity, because the absence of statehood, depriving the ethnic group of the opportunity to fully realize its own potential, makes it a subordinate unit lower than the "nation".
• The Republic of Armenia, with the exclusive right to formulate a common pan-Armenian agenda, with the levers of creating a corresponding culture of public consciousness, must define the subordination of national identity criteria.
 According to that, the objective condition for being Armenian is heredity, and the subjective precondition for expressing Armenianness is the connection with the state.
• The re-emergence of statehood in the subjective domain of national identity will have a great impact on the effective implementation of national geopolitics.
 The latter is the only precondition not only to adapt to modern geopolitical processes, but also to influence the development of those processes.
