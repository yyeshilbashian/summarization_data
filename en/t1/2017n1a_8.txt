The foundations of Shirak's modern economy were laid in the 1990sin the years.
  The region until 1988 The catastrophic earthquake in Spitak is ours
It was one of the largest industrial regions of the republic.
The volume of commodity production issued by the industrial enterprises of Shirak region in 1985 made 13.4% of the total volume issued in the republic [3], in 1997 - only 3.2% [2, page 2], in 2003 - 2.7%
[1, p. 103] և In 2014, it was 3.8% [6].
 1987 The number of people employed in the region was 139.3 thousand, and in Gyumri - 75.2 thousand, in 2001 - 79.4 և 29.8 thousand respectively [4, p. 121], in 2014 - 103.5 and 34.1 thousand people [7]
A sharp decline in population employment over the past three decadesregistered in the industrial sphere.
  Busy regionThe population decreased by 35.8 thousand, and in Gyumri - by 40.3 thousand.
Taking into account the XX century. last և XXI century. It took place in Shirak region at the beginning of
Socio-economic changes: we conditionally divide the periods into the following successive stages:1985-1988 - pre-disaster phase
1989-1992 - post-disaster phase,
1993-2000 pervasive privatization առաջին first of the population
years of mass emigration
2001-2008 years of socio-economic growth և stabilization,
2009 The second population of the socio-economic crisis so far
years of mass emigration.
In the pre-disaster stage, Shirak was a developed industrial region.
Only in Gyumri (formerly Leninakan) there were more than 30 industrial enterprises, where the number of employed, according to official statistics, was 45 thousand.
  More than half of the workers in industrial enterprises fell to the light industry.
The number of employees in Gyumri textile factory has exceeded 10 thousand, in machine-building enterprises - 12 thousand, in the non-material sphere - 30 thousand.
  Industrial enterprises did not operateonly in urban, but also in many rural settlements of the region.
 The leading branches of industry development were the light industry, machine building, food and construction materials industry.and in agriculture, cereals, sugar beetsPotato cultivation in Ashotsk և Amasia administrative districts:cattle breeding.
1988 The Spitak earthquake hit the economy hard.
Material losses were estimated at 13-14 billion rubles, the bulk of whichfell to Gyumri [5, p. 123].
 As a result of the disaster, 70% of the main production funds of industrial enterprises were destroyed.Production capacities sharply decreased.
 Added to this were the energy crisis, the transport blockade, and privatizationinefficient implementation process.
  As a result, industrial enterprises largely ceased to function, and tens of thousands of citizens became unemployed, emigrating.
 If before the earthquake more than 50 thousand people worked in the industrial enterprises of the region, now according to the official data it does not exceed 7 thousand (see Table 1).
  The builders of the Russian Federation in 1993 They left the disaster zone, taking with them most of the construction equipment.
 As a result, in fact, the whole burden of the work being donefell on the shoulders of the construction complex of our republic.
 Besides,The blockade carried out by Azerbaijan in 1989 caused great damage to the reconstruction works. Since September, the war in Nagorno Karabakh, the presence of refugees in the republic
The current socio-economic and energy crisis.

In general, the mid-1990s were idle years of industrial enterprises. Եւ In Shirak region, particularly in Gyumri industrial complex, institutionalUnemployment.
 True, at the expense of the World Bank smallvolume of construction was carried out, but the works were incomplete, the buildings were put into operation unfinished, whichin turn, they created new problems.
 Undoubtedly, the progress of the region, particularly Gyumri, and the solution of the existing problems firstև used to be conditioned by the production and economic sphere, especiallywith the development of industry.
  The production capacities of the industrial enterprises operating in the Shirak area are currently used by 5-10%, and almost three dozen enterprises do not produce at all.
 1990 then in enterprises
No new equipment or advanced technologies were introduced.
The average age of enterprise machinery is over 45.if they are even physically viable, then morally long agoThey are worn out.
  Insufficient financial resources, scarcity of raw materials, especially low purchasing power of the populationhinder the development of entrepreneurship.
 Restoration of industrial capacity in the current conditions of the economy, first of allIt should be based on the internal capabilities of the republic.
 Today,without state support, tax-favorable territorialpolicy արտաքին external funding sources are impossibleDevelopment of industry, expansion of the market և population of the regionSolving employment problems.
Thus, the problem of the Disaster Zone cannot be considered solved years later.
  Gyumri needs serious attention from the authoritieson the other hand, a serious problem of job creation.
 Of course, by adopting laws only in this case, the issue will not be solved, because no matter how perfect those laws are, if they are not controlled, they are not implemented properly.
  Until clearly regulated work is established between the legislative, executive and local self-government bodies, DisasterThe issue of the zone will remain unresolved, and the laws will remain on paper.
What is the picture of employment and unemployment in Gyumri?
According to official statistics, in 1996 The number of unemployed decreased from 29 thousand և 2014 was 12 thousand or decreased 2.4 times.
 Note that:The decrease in the number of unemployed is not due to new jobscreation, emigration of other labor force.
  According to the Gyumri Regional Employment Center, in 2000About 29 thousand job seekers were registered in November.21388 or 69.2% of them were women.
 In Gyumri in 1992-2014. Employment and unemployment had the following picture. busy:
A sharp decrease was registered only in the manufacturing sector, and the number of people employed in the service sector, compared to the pre-disaster period.has not changed, moreover, there are areas where growth has been registered,particularly in the fields of education, health and management, which had its impact on the change in the structure of the main branches of the economy of the Shirak region (see Table 2).

Finally, in the last three decades, Shirak has changed from an industrial area to an extensive agricultural one.
 If 1987 More than 70% of the gross output of the economy fell to industry, and
20% to agriculture, then in 2014 the same indicator was 25% և 57%, respectively.
 Undoubtedly, the socio-economic future of the regionProgress լուծ Problem solving is primarily conditionedwith the development of the production and economic sphere, in particular industry.
