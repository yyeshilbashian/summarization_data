The foundations of Shirak's modern economy were laid in the 1990s.
  The region until 1988 The catastrophic earthquake in Spitak was one of the largest industrial regions of the republic.
The volume of commodity production issued by the industrial enterprises of Shirak region in 1985 amounted to 13.4% of the total volume issued in the country [3], in 1997 - only 3.2% [2, page 2], in 2003 - 2.7% [1, page 103] և 2014 .: 3.8% [6].
 1987 The number of people employed in the region was 139.3 thousand, and in Gyumri - 75.2 thousand, in 2001 - 79.4 և 29.8 thousand respectively [4, p. 121], in 2014 - 103.5 and 34.1 thousand people [7]
In the last three decades, the employment of the population has sharply decreased in the industrial sphere.
  The employed population of the region decreased by 35.8 thousand, and in Gyumri - by 40.3 thousand.
Taking into account the XX century. last և XXI century. Socio-economic changes that took place in Shirak region at the beginning of the year, we conditionally divide the periods into the following successive phases: 1985-1988 - pre-disaster phase,
1989-1992 - post-disaster phase,
1993-2000 pervasive privatization առաջին first of the population
years of mass emigration
2001-2008 years of socio-economic growth և stabilization,
2009 The second population of the socio-economic crisis so far
years of mass emigration.
In the pre-disaster stage, Shirak was a developed industrial region.
Only in Gyumri (formerly Leninakan) there were more than 30 industrial enterprises, where the number of employed, according to official statistics, was 45 thousand.
  More than half of the workers in industrial enterprises fell to the light industry.
The number of employees in Gyumri textile factory has exceeded 10 thousand, in machine-building enterprises - 12 thousand, in the non-material sphere - 30 thousand.
  Industrial enterprises operated not only in urban areas, but also in many rural areas of the region.
 The leading branches of industry development were the light industry, machine building, food and construction materials industry, and in agriculture, the cultivation of grain crops, sugar beet, potato, in Ashotsk և Amasia administrative districts, cattle breeding.
1988 The Spitak earthquake hit the economy hard.
The material losses were estimated at 13-14 billion rubles, the main part of which fell to Gyumri [5, p. 123].
 As a result of the disaster, 70% of the main production funds of industrial enterprises were destroyed, production capacities sharply decreased.
 Added to this was the energy crisis, the transport blockade, the process of effective implementation of privatization.
  As a result, industrial enterprises largely ceased to function, and tens of thousands of citizens became unemployed, emigrating.
 If before the earthquake more than 50 thousand people worked in the industrial enterprises of the region, now according to the official data it does not exceed 7 thousand (see Table 1).
  The builders of the Russian Federation in 1993 They left the disaster zone, taking with them most of the construction equipment.
 As a result, in fact, the entire burden of the work carried out fell on the shoulders of the construction complex of our republic.
 In addition, the restoration work was severely damaged by the blockade imposed by Azerbaijan in 1989. The war in Nagorno Karabakh, the presence of refugees, the socio-economic and energy crisis in the republic since September 2010.

In general, the mid-1990s were an idle year for industrial enterprises. Ում Institutional unemployment was registered in the Shirak region, particularly in the Gyumri industrial complex.
 It is true that small-scale construction was carried out at the expense of the World Bank, but the work was incomplete, the buildings were put into operation unfinished, which in turn created new problems.
 Undoubtedly, the progress of the region, particularly Gyumri, and the solution of the existing problems were first of all conditioned by the development of the production and economic sphere, especially industry.
  The production capacities of the industrial enterprises operating in the Shirak area are currently used by 5-10%, and almost three dozen enterprises do not produce at all.
 1990 After that, no new equipment or advanced technologies were introduced in the enterprises.
The average age of enterprise machinery is over 45. If they are even physically usable, then they are morally worn out.
  Insufficient financial resources, scarcity of raw materials, especially the low purchasing power of the population hinder the development of entrepreneurship.
 In the current conditions of the economy, the restoration of industrial capacities must first be based on the internal capabilities of the republic.
 Today, without state support, favorable tax policy և external sources of financing, impossible industrial development, market expansion լուծ solving the problems of the population of the region.
Thus, the problem of the Disaster Zone cannot be considered solved years later.
  Gyumri needs serious attention from the authorities, also a serious problem of job creation.
 Of course, by adopting laws only in this case, the issue will not be solved, because no matter how perfect those laws are, if they are not controlled, they are not implemented properly.
  Until clearly regulated work is established between the legislature, the executive and the local self-government bodies, the disaster issue will remain unresolved and the laws on paper.
What is the picture of employment and unemployment in Gyumri?
According to official statistics, in 1996 The number of unemployed decreased from 29 thousand և 2014 was 12 thousand or decreased 2.4 times.
 It should be noted that the decrease in the number of unemployed is not conditioned by the creation of new jobs, but by the emigration of labor.
  According to the Gyumri Regional Employment Center, about 29,000 job seekers were registered in November 2000. 21,388 of them or 69.2% were women.
 In Gyumri in 1992-2014. Employment and unemployment had the following picture. The number of employed people in the service sector has decreased significantly, and the number of people employed in the service sector has not changed compared to the pre-disaster period. on the change in the structure of the main branches of the economy (see Table 2).
Table 2 Shirak region 1987, 2008 և 2015 Specific weights of the main branches of the economy in the total volume (by%) of the corresponding branches of the republic.
Finally, in the last three decades, Shirak has changed from an industrial area to an extensive agricultural one.
 If 1987 More than 70% of the gross output of the economy fell to industry, and 20% to agriculture. the same indicator was 25% և 57%, respectively.
 Undoubtedly, the further socio-economic progress of the region լուծ the solution of the problems is first of all conditioned by the development of the non-productive economic sphere, particularly industry.
