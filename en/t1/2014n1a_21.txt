In order to solve the problem of recreational nature use of forests, it is necessary to study the natural conditions of the area, to identify the most favorable areas for the organization of recreation.
Introduction.
  In the conditions of rapidly growing recreational forest use, the assessment of forests is an urgent issue not only from the point of view of forestry, but also from the point of view of recreational-tourism potential.
  The issue of recreational attractiveness of forests has been repeatedly referred to by E. Repshas [1], N.S. Kazanskaya [2], N.V. Romashov [3], A. I. Tarasov [4], S.A. Gensiruka [5] և others.
 It should be noted that the methodology for assessing the recreational potential of forests proposed by different authors can not be universal.
 That is, it can be used for forests located in different physical-geographical zones.
The most prominent of the above works is E. Repshasimenography, in which the author offers a unique methodology, which allows to assess the suitability of Lithuanian forests for the organization of various species.
Description of the methodology.
  The research carried out by us is based on E. The method proposed by Repshas, ​​in which the assessment of the forest recreational potential is done in four main directions.
 The evaluation scheme is presented in Table 1.
In the mentioned directions, it is more difficult to assess the aesthetic features of the forest, as it is often subjective.
 According to previous studies, the most objective factor that affects the aesthetic property is the spatial structure of the forest, its natural state և diversity.
The aesthetic feature of the forest recreational assessment is determined by the points "X" (minimum - 3 points, maximum - 15 points).
 It depends on the scores of a number of indicators.
The evaluation scheme is presented in Tables 2 և 3.
 The sum of the aesthetic features is calculated by the formula presented in Esther [1].
where X1-9 is the corresponding index of aesthetic features in points APF - the score of the aesthetic property of the forest in points.

According to the variety, the most valuable are the plantations, which consist of two or three species, have dense young և sub-forest, as well as various grass cover, where there are many flowering species.
When assessing the natural state, the conformity of the tree species with the local natural conditions is taken into account.
  The degree of anthropogenic variability of the forest cover of the forest can be as high as the density of the trail network.

 By stability, it is necessary to understand the number of recreants in the area of ​​forest bio-habitat, which causes any negative phenomenon (digression 1).
Table 3. Assessment of natural state of the forest Index ԾTree suitability to the siteCriterionBall The species composition does not correspond to the siteNon-dominant species are suitable for the siteDominant species are suitable for the site 1 Digression should not be confused with degradation.
 By digression, it is necessary to understand the deterioration of the ecosystem due to external or internal stimuli.
 Digestion can progress to catachenosis (decay), after which the ecosystem can eventually decay [8, p. 23].
Living Area Compatibility in Root ForestTrail AreaSurface with Completely Anthropogenic Modifications Compliance up to 25% Surface Compliance up to 75% Surface Compliance up to 100% Surface Up to 100% 5; 9;], which are dedicated to recreational stability, it has been found that different forest formations have different stability to recreational loads.
 For example, in some forests the negative effects are already felt at a load of 2 people-hours / ha.
 In other types of forests, the load can reach up to 10 man-hours / ha, without any negative changes.
  For example, NV Ramashov [3] considers the workload of 6 man-hours / ha as a recreational norm (maximum) for birch and aspen forests.
 For conifers, especially pines, in mountainous terrain, the maximum load can reach only 2 man-hours / ha [10, p. 25].
The main factor characterizing the stability of geosystems is the distribution (place) conditions of the given system, the dominant type, the structure of the plantations, the degree of recreational digression.
With greater recreational stability, according to [1; 3; 4] works, characterize the forests where oak is dominant, and the pine trees have the least stability.
 According to E. In Repshas, ​​group trees have more stability, and those with equal distribution have less stability.

After evaluating the presented indicators, the recreational stability of the studied forest area can be calculated by the following formula: where RS is the assessment of recreational stability in points, y 41
Recreational stability indicators according to Table 4.
- One of the important directions of forest recreation is the medical rest.
 In this respect, the pines stand out, where clinics and rest houses are organized.
At present, the so-called forest therapy is developing rapidly, which implies the restoration of health by using the healing properties of the forest.
In the conditions of Armenia, particularly in the area of ​​Gyulagarak sanctuary, the pine tree provides such an opportunity.
 At a certain time of the year in the area of ​​Sochut, trees release large amounts of phytoncides, which kill pathogenic bacteria, helping to restore human health.

 The latter is based on several indicators, which are presented in Table 5.
E. From the indicators proposed by Repshas, ​​7 indicators were singled out for the sanitary-hygienic assessment of the area of ​​Gyulagarak sanctuary, which are most relevant for mountain forests.

The results of the research.
  The main wealth of the Gyulagarak sanctuary is the pine, which is represented here by one species, the Caucasian pine (Pinus Hamata).
 This is the largest pine area in Armenia.
The latter consists of two sites, the largest of which occupies 75 hectares, extending to the slopes of the northwestern position, the second smallest site, 15 hectares, extends to the northeastern, opposite slope of the Tormak River valley.
 Due to the location, the height of the pines in Gyulagarak reserve reaches up to 30 m, and the diameter of the nest is 0.5-0.6 m.
 In dense paintings, the pine has a slender, stemless stem.
 On thinner, rocky, dry slopes, the pine gets a non-slender appearance.
Pine lives up to 250 years in the territory of Armenia.
 It is a light species that grows well during the spread of light, strong soils.
 In relatively high, rocky, rocky areas of the sanctuary, the height of the pine does not exceed 7-8 m.
 In our conditions, pine is well tolerated and lacks moisture, it reproduces only by seeds.
 The relic origin of Ayn.
To assess the recreational potential of Gyulagarak Reserve, we have divided the area into three conventional sections (sectors): western (I), central (II) and eastern (III).
As a result of the assessment, the third part of the sanctuary or the eastern part of the sanctuary stands out with its recreational opportunities, where especially high scores were obtained as a result of the assessment of sanitary and hygienic conditions.
 Out of 35 maximum possible points, 21.5 points were obtained, which is equivalent to 61.4%.
 In fact, it can be said that the sanitary-hygienic conditions in the pine area are favorable for the organization of rest.
 High scores were obtained during the assessment of recreational stability.
 Out of a possible maximum of 20 points, the recreational stability of the pine is estimated at 15 points, which is 75%, which is a good indicator.
 In other words, in the right organization, the pine tree allows to receive a significant number of recreants.
At the same time, it should be noted that different degrees of endigression are observed in all parts, which indicates a significant anthropogenic impact.

 M1.
 The relatively low aesthetic score of the 100,000 Archelian (III) section of 12 points, or 27% of the maximum possible, is due to the multiplicity of rating scores (X1-9) required for any aesthetic assessment to ensure relatively high accuracy.
Aesthetic assessment is based on the subjective perception of a person, which requires a large amount of data analysis to generate a relatively accurate result.
The lowest rate of stability was recorded in the central part of the sanctuary, where, along with pine, broadleaf species are widespread.
 The reason for the low scores is probably due to the significant flows of people նրանց their intense movements in the forest, which is evidenced by the degree of digression (2 points).
  In this case, the situation is much better in the western (I) section, where the specific weight of conifers is observed in the species composition, therefore the stability assessment scores are even higher.
 High scores were obtained for the assessment of the sanitary and hygienic conditions of the western part, which cannot be deduced from the aesthetic indicators, which are the lowest in the whole territory of the sanctuary.
 The latter is conditioned both by the relatively uniformity of the species composition and by the weak fragmentation of the relief.
In general, it can be said that the recreational opportunities of Gyulagarak sanctuary are quite high.
 They have a higher than average index in all three sections separated for evaluation.
 The eastern (III) section stands out with the most favorable recreational opportunities, where pine predominates in the species composition of the forest.
 According to the scores, the eastern part of the reserve or pine was estimated at 48.5 points, which is 80.8% of the maximum possible.
Properly organized nature use, with the creation of appropriate infrastructure, pine can become one of the most attractive recreation areas in Armenia.
