The principle of continuity of mother tongue teaching is conditioned by the consistent learning of language levels.
  During the teaching, the content of the Armenian language, the gradual mastery of language levels, develops in learners the ability to construct speech, to control their speech, to display appropriate verbal behavior in different situations, as well as to provide sufficient, sound knowledge of all sections of the language system.
  Systematic learning of individual language units contributes to the development of learners' analytical skills [1].
  It is noteworthy that in modern linguistics, a large number of scientific studies on parts of speech occupy a special place, as a result of which grammatical changes of not only words, parts of speech that are related to them, but also their grammatical features are used.
 Learners acquire knowledge of the grammatical structure of the language և its elements, as a result of which they are able to differentiate parts of speech according to the general meanings expressed by them ք according to grammatical features [2].
 During the training we noticed the students the fact that the noun, as a part of speech, shows material objects in general.
 Noun-specific grammatical categories are simple և being simple, having certain և indefinite meanings, the grammatical order of the consonant, the grammatical order of the number, etc.
As a result of the preliminary analysis, we point out that the grammatical order of the noun number indicates the number of objects.
  It follows that the noun has two unique numbers, which indicate a single object: a stone, a house, a monastery, a door, etc.
 As mentioned by S. Abrahamyan [3], in some uses of the singular noun, the singular-plural opposition is neutralized, և the singular can express a) the meaning of the indefinite plural, b) the collective.
  And the plural number indicates more than one subject: books, cities, gardens, etc.
We have tried to use the purposeful learning of the learners in the article on the composition of the plural of the noun, which, we think, is difficult from the point of view of the learners' knowledge.
 Parts of speech և their grammatical features are taught in the 7th grade of secondary school.
By focusing on the grammatical order of the basic theoretical knowledge of noun's grammatical features, especially the composition of the plural, we ask the question to what extent learners can turn the knowledge they have acquired into social skills.
Any lesson is effective ում serves its purpose if it is built with modern methodical tricks.
 During the training, the teacher creates problematic situations, when the students find the answers to the questions on their own, make inquiries.
 [1]
The subject program of the "Noun Number" sub-general secondary school envisages four lessons.
 In order to organize the lesson effectively, the teaching is conducted in a deductive way.
In the first lesson, general information is given about the suffixes of numbers of the nouns, -s, then words related to the topic taught by the method of brainstorming are listed and ideas are expressed.
 Each student is free to express his / her point of view.
  All approaches and ideas are recorded on the board.
  Then the teacher writes two rows of nouns on the board, one-syllable and one-syllable, then suggests writing the plurals, emphasizing the endings, such as trees - trees room - rooms - walls - book - books - house - house - corner - heart - hearts - spring - spring Learners notice the difference , then with the help of the teacher determines that the plural of singular nouns is formed with -s, and the plural of polynomial nouns is formed with -s ending.
  One of the students reads the relevant part of the textbook, they strengthen the rule by un-examining.
  The next step is to do the training exercises as well as the homework assignment.
The purpose of the second lesson is to provide students with solid information about plural deviations.
  According to the above-mentioned principle, it is instructed to write three series of nouns on the board: fish - pasture - watchmaker mouse - textbook - novelist - slippery - large load bakery - miner. is.
 The plural of the words of the second row is formed with the ending -er, then it is followed by noting that the words of this series are complex in composition, the last components are monosyllabic, the plural is formed with the ending -er.
 The last components of the complex words of the third series are both monosyllabic, but contain a meaning of action, as a novelist means a novelist, and so on.
One of the leading tasks of the teacher is to impart knowledge about other words that deviate from the regularity of the plural composition, such as Russian -, man -, woman -, etc.
The third lesson is divided into sub-topics by the group research method. The research groups are instructed to complete the tasks in the given period.
 The combination of the separated parts forms the general picture of the research, after which each group selects one speaker, through which it finds out the involvement of the group members անը the degree of mastering the assigned topic.
  The first group represents the group of monosyllabic nouns whose consonant h is in the second syllable, that the plural of these words is formed by the particle -s, such as tiger-teg-star-notebook box emperor-daughter-combThe second group represents the group of nouns; whose consonant h is in the first syllable, և is formed with the ending -s, such as school, scissors, tie, tablecloth, chest և etc.
The third group represents the point of view of modern Armenian, - we, -onk, onk, - we have a group of nouns with the ending, of which the formations with -enk are regular, while the onk-ounk-ovdz have a colloquial tone և limited usage, like grandparents, yours Նպատակ The aim of the fourth group is to present the features of the plural form of nouns, separating three groups: a) nouns that have "singular" plural nouns: city, field, sea, book, etc.
b) nouns that have only a singular number և թվ are not usually used.
  They are carefree nouns: milk, bread, dough, oil, etc.
 c) nouns that have only the plural number և չեն can not be used in the singular.
 They are neuter nouns: Ander, Carpathians, etc.
Learners are also introduced to the plural form of nouns in modern Armenian with the particle q, which can be used to form words ending in -tsi, -etsi, -atsi, such as lorietsi-q, citizen -q, these also have parallel suffixes -s. composed of which are more canonical for the literary language, while the former are specific to the vernacular.
The next group presents the cases of phonetic change during the composition of the plural number. a. The closed syllable i of monosyllabic words becomes h. Books, prices, hearts.
b. The closed syllable and the plural of monosyllabic words become h. Doors, swords, water.
c. The last and of the monosyllabic words becomes v. eggs-eggs, lu-lver.
The fourth lesson is a topic summary lesson, which is conducted through self-assessment through the GUS chart.
 It becomes obvious what knowledge, abilities and skills the learners acquire while mastering the topic.
As homework, it is instructed to compose a plural of the words knee, thought, stream, garden, load, shooter, and then invent a short story.
