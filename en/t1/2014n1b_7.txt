 Note that the sound change of oy is not specific to the mentioned area, therefore it can be assumed that gi arose by combining the sounds of c. The addition of a vowel to a vowel could be a combination of verbs with a vowel.
 As a proof confirming the above-mentioned hypothesis, we can mention Goris's dialect, where the guitar version is composed of the verbs in the vowel of which there is a vowel: ki kirem "krem", ki kires, ki kire, ki kirnek, ki kirek, ki kiren.

 A. Haneyan puts forward the following version with the origin of a weather mark. First, the verb dd պիտի was formed from must, as a result of which the vowel beginning verbs had difficulty in pronunciation.
 To overcome this problem, d was changed to n (bd> bn).
 Then the last step took place, the partial taking of b by n, by which b changed its sound to m, producing a particle 2.

It seems that if in the dialect part of the Eastern faction (Araratian (Yerevan, Lori, Shamshadin-Dilijan), ArdvinTbilisi dialects, Karabakh-Shamakhi (Shaghakh, Havarik, Hadrut) are used in other places, the origin of this particle is unknown. (H. Acharyan, op. Cit., P. 145).

From the comparative examination of the dialect material, it becomes clear that in the regional versions of the Armenian language, the tenses-tenses function in many positional variants, which are the result of phonetic changes, the beginning or the end of a combination of different components.
 Often the above changes work at the same time.
