1. Introduction.
  At present, the following systems with computer mathematics are widely used: Mathematica, Matlab, Mathcad և Maple, which allow solving scientific and technical problems without delving into the nuances of programming.
  Moreover, the Mathematica system has always been regarded as the world's leading computer mathematics system [1-5].
 In Mathematica, most problems are solved in dialog mode, without traditional programming, using standard operators.
 At the same time, it has a modern high-level programming language.
Note that the calculation of definite իսկ real-time integrals in the Mathematica environment can be performed by standard operators in it [3-5].
 Of great interest, however, is the computation of definite finite integrals by degree series [6,7].
 In accordance with the method mentioned in the work, computational programs are developed for the calculation of certain իսկ integral integrals in the Mathematica environment.
2. The application of step series for the calculation of definite integrals.
  The method of calculating definite integrals by degree series is based on the theorem of integral members of functional series [6,7].
 That is, if the Functional series evenly coincides in a certain segment, the function is the sum of that series, the functional series of the integrals (
  with respect to the variable, where) is also equally parallel in that segment և the fraction is the function.
Here we will refer not to the proof of the theorem, but to its application.
This is how we have the integral.
 Analyze the function in the vicinity of the Taylor series point (assuming that the function satisfies all the required Taylor series analysis conditions around the point [6,7]) ...) (...)

Calculating si3 with the help of the standard operator of the Mathematica environment, we will get 1.84865253 with great accuracy.
  Comparing, we can say that the given method provides great accuracy.

To ensure accuracy, the integral computation program in Mathematica environment (7) will look like this. As a result of the project implementation, we get: Thus, the accuracy is already maintained by the 8 members of the series.
Note that the programs allow you to perform calculations in case of any certain integral, you just need to match the input data in the first lines.
We can, using the above theorem, get the function with appropriate accuracy և construct the graph.
 Thus, if we accept the graphs in the above program, we will get (Fig. 1), then we will get the function.

  Note that the results obtained by further addition of the members of the series coincide with the red-orange curves.
3. The use of step series for the calculation of non-integrals.
 Now let us have the infinite integral from the infinite function with finite edges.
 Then suppose that
The special point of the function corresponds to the lower limit of the integral.
 It should be noted that all other cases can lead to the above-mentioned case.
 Thus, if the special point is, then.
 And if the special point is the point, then.
That is, all cases can be led to it when the special point is the lower limit of the integral.
Suppose that in the vicinity of the point is analyzed a series of (4) degrees.
  By integrating the (4) degree series, we will get the following function member by member: function In which (8) the function will be parallel to.
 Let's show that it will be pro-point at this point.
 Consider row (8) when, since row (4) is parallel at any point, then we have the Dallamber index of the sequence of convergences. is 1.
 Therefore, when, then (11) the boundary is less than 1, և then (9) the series will be parallel to the point և back և the function will be the generalized initial of the function, hence և.
Therefore, the above-described method of calculating the integral by degree series is also applicable in this case.
Consider the integral, where 0 is a special point for the integral function.
 According to the described method, the calculation program for the integral has the following view: 𝑎 = 0; 𝑏 = 1 2⁄; x0 = 1 3⁄; 𝑛 = 300; 𝑓 [x_].
 = 𝑥 − 1 2⁄ (1 - 𝑥) −1 2⁄; As a result of the implementation of the program we get: Calculating the integral with the help of the standard operator of the Mathematica environment, we will get 1.57079633.
 Comparing, we can say that the above method provides great accuracy և rather fast coupling.

Note that the given calculation program can also be applied to any non-integral integral that satisfies the above conditions.
 For this purpose, you just need to enter the corresponding input data in the first line of the program.
  In addition, you can create a program here that provides advance accuracy.
Now consider the integral.
 Implementing the program for him, we will get: And the exact value is 1.66179243.

The obtained results confirm the efficiency of the calculation of non-integral integrals from finite finite functions by the mentioned method.
4. Conclusion.
  Thus, the approximation methods considered in the work are quite effective.
 Moreover, due to the wide possibilities provided by the Mathematica environment, the calculation programs of these methods are easier to implement, and the obtained results can be observed graphically, further studies can be carried out in a more observational way, which is done in the work.
 It should be noted that at this stage in the development of computer mathematics, approximate methods have become more widely developed, in which the Mathematica environment is widely regarded as the world's leading computer mathematics system.
