1. Introduction.
  Computers are now widely usedMathematica, Matlab, Mathcad և Maple, which provide solutions to scientific and technical problemsproblems without delving into the nuances of programming.
  Moreover,The Mathematica system has always been regarded as a world leaderin the system of computer mathematics [1-5].
 In Mathematica, most problems are solved in a dialog mode.without traditional programming, using standard operators.
 At the same time, it has a high level of modernityprogramming language.
Note that the calculation of definite և integral integrals is Mathematicacan be implemented in the environment through the standard operators available in it [3-5].
 Of great interest, however, is the calculation of definite's real integrals by degree series[6,7].
 In accordance with the method mentioned in the work, computational programs are developed for the calculation of certain իսկ integral integrals in the Mathematica environment.
2. The application of step series to the calculation of definite integralsfor.
  Definite integral integrals of degree seriesThe calculation method is based on the functional series membermember integration theorem [6,7].
 That is, if:The functional series evenly coincides with somein the segment և:The function is the sum of that series, thenfunctional series of integrals (
  with respect to the variable where:) is also equally parallel in that segment և to itis the amount function.
Here we will look not at the proof of the theorem, but at itapplication.
This is how we lookthe integral.
 Analyze the function according to the Taylor series around the point (assuming that: function satisfiesall the required conditions for Taylor series analysis [6,7])...) (...)

Calculating si3 with the help of a standard Mathematica environment operator:We will get 1.84865253 with great accuracy.
  Comparing we can say that:The above method provides great accuracy.

It is given in advanceMathematica to ensure accuracyin environment (7) the integral computation program will look like this:As a result of the implementation of the program we will get:Thus,  Accuracy is already provided in Series 8by preserving the members.
Note that programs allow you to perform calculations in case of any particular integral, it is just necessaryMatch the input data in the first lines.
We can get it using the theorem above the function with appropriate accuracy և construct the graph.
 So if the aboveAccept in the given programgraphs, we will get (Fig. 1), then we get the function.

  Note the future members of the seriesThe results obtained by addition match red և orangecurves.
3. The application of degree series to nonlinear integralsfor counting.
 Now we have it with finite edges the non-integral from an unlimited function.
 Then supposethat:
The special point of the function corresponds to the lower limit of the integral.
 Note that all other cases can lead to the abovein the case.
 So if a special pointis, then.
 And if:The special point is the point that:, then:.
That is, all cases can be led to it when the special point is the lower limit of the integral.
Suppose he! in the vicinity of the point is analyzed in (4) degree series.
  Integrating the (4) degree series:We will get the following function member by member. function:Moreover, the function (8) will be parallelin.
 Let's show ithe will be parallel! at the point.
 Consider series (8) when:Since series (4) is parallel to any point, then by:We have the Dallamer mark of the convergence of the series:Let us now apply the Dalber mark to series (9)The first border on the right is less than 1 by (10), the second limitis equal to 1.
 So when? , then (11) the limit will be smallerFrom 1, և subsequently (row 9) will be parallel և point backwardsfunction will be:  generalized initialization of the functionin, so և.
Then calculate the integral through the step seriesThe described method is applicable in this case as well.
Consider: integral, where 0 is a special pointfor an integral function.
 According to the described method:settlement program has the following for the integralappearance:𝑎 = 0; 𝑏 = 1 2⁄; x0 = 1 3⁄; 𝑛 = 300; 𝑓 [x_].
 = 𝑥 − 1 2⁄ (1 - 𝑥) −1 2⁄;As a result of the project implementation, we get:Calculating the integral of the standard operator of the Mathematica environmentwith the help of which we will get 1.57079633.
 Comparing we can say the aboveThe given method provides great accuracy և fairly fast concurrenceis.

The graph clarifies from the point of view of practical concurrence:.
Note that the calculation program can also be usedwith respect to any non-integral integral satisfying the abovethe mentioned conditions.
 You just need a program for thatEnter the corresponding input data in the first line.
  Except:That is, it is possible to make a program here, which provides a given in advanceaccuracy.
Now let's look the integral.

The obtained results are confirmed by the mentioned method with a finite edgeThe efficiency of calculating non-integral integrals from unlimited functions.
4. Conclusion.
  Thus, the approximate observed in the workThe calculation methods are quite effective.
 Moreover, due to the wide possibilities provided by the Mathematica environment, the implementation of the calculation programs of these methods is easier, and the obtained resultsIt is also possible to observe graphically, to carry out further studies in a more observational way, which is done in the work.
 It should be noted that the development of computer mathematics in thisAt this stage, the approximate methods have been developed more widely, in which a largeMathematica environment plays a role as a world leaderin the system of computer mathematics.
