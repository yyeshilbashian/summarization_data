Any pedagogical technology contains resources,which intensify գործունե intensify the activities of learners, but there are technologies in which these resources are presentedas expressions of the main idea և guarantors of effectiveness.
  These include preventive-perspective / Lysenkova /, game, problem, programmed, individual, etc.technologies.
 In this study, we tried to present the peculiarities of interactive game technologies, because due to the demands of modernity, they are in great demand today, making the learning process more active, efficient andinteresting.
In the practice of teaching, especially in recent decades, technologies based on game modeling have been widely used.
 These technologies are distinguished by their diversity, efficiency, and are in great demand in our time.
  Pedagogical interactive game technologyA. were engaged in the study. P. Panfilova [4], A. Մ. Gurchich [2], S.
A. Mukhina, A. A. Solovyova [3] և others.
Game training implies solutions to various problems related to professional activities, human relationships, personal difficulties.
The possibilities of interactive game technologies are quite wide.
a. They allow to cover a wide range of issues.
b. They correspond to the logic of the activity.
c. Contribute to the greater number of participants in the educational process
Involvement, they are driven to unprovoked activity.
d. Stereotypes are overcome more easily, self-esteem is corrected.
e. They provide an opportunity to make comprehensive analyzes, comments, and to interpret the obtained results.
f. Contribute to all the qualities of a person, individual positive ասական negative
expression of abilities և etc.
In addition, the goals of the game technology are agreed uponto the practical needs of the learners.
Play, combined with work-teaching, is a kind of activity not only for children but also for adults.
 Gurchich thinksis that situations and situations are taken into account in the game,a certain form of activity, social experience, and as a result the control of one's own behavior is improved [2, p. 9].
Gaming in life has a number of functions:- fun (causes pleasure, excitement, arouses interest),- self-affirmation,- Therapeutic (overcoming game difficulties that coincide with life difficulties),- predictive (in the process of the game you can recognize yourself, showown hidden forces),- changes in correctional-rehabilitation / game practicepersonal qualities, socialization of a person takes place /.
Mukhina writes that the game is always played voluntarily,Includes elements of competition, entertains participants,helps to establish oneself [3, p. 25].
The game has been used since ancient times as a teaching method, a means of transferring experience from the older generation to the next generation.
 In a modern school, play activities are carried out in the following cases:- as an independent technology,- as a component of pedagogical technology,- as a way of organizing a lesson!
To properly evaluate the place and role of game technologyTeachers must be well aware of the functions of the game.
 Didactic:The effectiveness of games depends first of all on the systematic use of them, then on the purposefulness of game programs and combining them with didactic exercisesskill.
Children սովոր learners in general are easily involved in the field of play activities և the more diverse it is, the moreit becomes more attractive.
 Gaming activities include games և:Exercises that develop the nature of the subjects, descriptiveto identify the features, to compare them with each other և to compareabilities.
 Games also allow to distinguish the real phenomena from the unreal, develop self-control, reaction speed, musical listening, etc. / 1, 32 /.
At a younger age, children create with the help of gamestheir world, guided by a bright imagination.
  High schoolage games are aimed at self-affirmation andstabilization, revelation of merits.
   The technology of all practical games consists of several stages.1. Preparatory.
  This stage includes script development,Determining the purpose of the training, substantiation of the set problem,Development of a business game plan, description of the actors, etc.
2. Enter the game.
  The names of the participants of the game are announcedThe conditions, the names of the experts, the main purpose, the choice of situations is substantiated.
  Criteria, rules and provisions are proposed.
3. The game process.
 No one has the right to interfere as soon as the game startsor to change anything.
  Only the player is eligible for the participantscontrol regulate actions if they leavedeviate from the main goal or deviate from the rules of the game.
4. Analysis of game results և evaluation.
 Experts express themselves, exchange opinions, and game participants canThey defended and clarified their actions.
 In the final round, the teacher notes the achievements and the results of the game և allowedSummarize the final result of the training.
There are several interactive game technologiestypes: practical, imitation, functional and role.
Practical games entered the school from the lives of adults.
They are used in the process of mastering new material են developcreative abilities.
  The game provides an opportunityto understand և to study the educational material from different angles.
Imitation games imitate the activities of an organization or production.
 They can be imitatedcases, specific types of people's activities (business meeting, plan discussion, conversation, etc.).
Functional games help to develop specific functions, such as public speaking.the skills to have, to campaign, to write essays, and so on.
  Such games are organizedin real conditions.
In role-plays, rules of conduct are developed for a specific personAbility to perform functions and responsibilities.
Scenarios are developed for such games, the roles of each participant are separated.
Various communicative trainings stand out in their professional training with their effectiveness, the main purpose of which is verbal և non-verbal learners.Development of competencies, interactive knowledge, abilities and skills.
 Organizing communication in these trainingsbecomes the main means of restorative effect.
One of such trainings is "Video training" (video training).
 This is the nameconducts video-based training.
 Videos are used for educational purposes in two ways.• showing ready-made videos• The use of video during the performance of a game task, its display and discussion.
The educational purpose of video training is constructive behavior ևis the development of communication skills.
Watching ready-made videos contributes to the following problemssolution.• Awareness,• Problem solving,• Capacity and skills development.
Watching videos for informational purposes is used as a means of summarizing a large amount of information, it is also a convenient way to show constructive, effective activity, the desired manifestations of behavior.
The other way to use video training is to play interactive games.
  Learners stage or present small situations, situations that may arise in business relationships or interpersonal relationships.
 That's allis filmed with a camera.
 Then, under the supervision of the pedagogue, the viewing of the filmed material is organized, which is accompanied by analyzes and discussions.
 This training allows directlyreflect on your own experience, use it as a learning material,which is discussed, analyzed վում transformed during the training.
Such trainings A. P. Panfilova [4, p. 125] does not recommend
conduct at the beginning of the learning process, as it may cause caution, constraint, voice in some participantschanges, excitement, tension, etc.
A skilled pedagogue should notice all the negatives in timeThe necessary measures to be taken.
  Negative trendsIt is recommended to use a second camera for reductionor during the third interactive lesson, when participants adapt to the presence of a camera.
  When planning a video recording, keep in mind that it usually changes your perception of yourself and your actions.
  With all this in mind, it is recommended for discussionto reserve the right to speak first to the person or persons who appeared in the shot.
  This will allow the participant or participants to:Express the observations and remarks they have noticed based on what they have seen that they would like to hear from others.
Of course, we should not forget that it is always necessary to finish the training with an optimistic, positive note.
One of the psychological phenomena in human interactionOne is that all people respond more to informationat the beginning ին to the end, moreover, the beginning creates the first impressionև arouses interest, and the end, as a rule, remainsin memory.
  Training should help the learner who sees himselfon the screen to perform restorative-corrective functions.
Video training gives everyone the opportunity to analyze their own image, facial expressions, movements, reactions, position ևetc.
 Naturally, it is necessary to remember that it is necessary to pay attention to both the revealed shortcomings and omissions, as well as the advantages and manifestations of professionalism.
Thus, the study shows that interactive technologies need to be demonstratedattention, know their types, peculiarities of application,advantages and disadvantages as the newest socialAs a result of the developments, serious changes are taking place todayin all areas of life and science, especially pedagogyas the effectiveness of the educational work is largely conditioned by the material availablewith interest, which can be achieved through interactive learning.
  Ours:As a result of the study, we came to the conclusion that even in higher education, interactive technologies can be introduced, especially during seminars and workshops.Video training can be successfully used to develop and improve the professional qualities of a future pedagogue.
