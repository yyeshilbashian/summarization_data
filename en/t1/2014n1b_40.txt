Modern education in high school differs in a number of features due to the need for radical changes in the organization and content of education.
 Today, high school students have other requirements and goals, the most important of which is the knowledge of vocabulary related to professional areas in addition to general English, as a basis for further specialization.
However, the modern English course in high school mainly contributes to the development of general vocabulary, so little attention is paid to the development of vocabulary related to specific professional fields.
 Therefore, the teaching of professional vocabulary, in particular mathematical terms, during the foreign language course in the high schools of the Republic of Armenia in the natural sciences and mathematics stream is very necessary and purposeful.
In this article, our goal is to develop և present effective strategies for introducing mathematical terms to 10th, 11th, and 12th grade science and math students at High School.
As it is known, vocabulary learning is a complex process, which includes the introduction and introduction of a new vocabulary using different ways of discovering the meaning, as well as its strengthening with appropriate exercises.
 Thus, the introduction of the word unit is the first stage of that process.
  As a three-step process, it includes the introduction of new material, the verification of what is understood, and the preliminary reinforcement. can appear in different proportions of these stages, depending on the complexity of the language material, the nature առանձնահատ the peculiarities of the educational group [1; 85].
When introducing a new word, it is necessary to acquaint the learners with the meaning of the word, horse և usage.
 The three mentioned parts of the word form a whole, և their separation is done only for methodological purposes, first of all to emphasize in particular those difficulties, which are connected with the way of overcoming the difficulties of mastering the word, with appropriate explanations և with exercises.
  Some words are difficult to master due to their use և grammatical form, others - a phonetic graphic image.
Work on the word implies the development of the ability to analyze the grammatical and lexical features of terms.
  From this point of view, the necessary information about the word - the writing of the word, the partial, sometimes the whole transcription, the affiliation of this or that word, the separation of the word-building elements, the identification of the main grammatical forms are also used.
When importing terminological language, a need arises: 1. separate և coordinate the main concepts of the given field, 2. Compose thematic word groups of the above-mentioned concepts in native, foreign languages, 3. Analyze the most appropriate means of scrutiny for effective memorization of terms. Introduce thematic word groups in different schemes, where the different aspects of the given concept, their sequence, subordination, etc. are clearly visible. To create special tricks with schematic materials for the introduction of the vocabulary և initial reinforcement stages, 6. Analyze the meaning of the terms horse using additional methods of explaining the vocabulary, for example, the structural model of the simple term, identify the internal horse of the term, highlight the common root, if it
The following is an example of a comparative analysis of mathematical terms in English, Russian, and Armenian և.
The terms presented in the spelling և sound coincide in two (English երեն Russian) և three (English, Russian, Armenian) languages.
Match in English և Russian. Algebra Cube-cubic geometriesplanar-parallel-vertical-pyramidal geometry. tableMatch in English, Russian և Armenian.integrallogarithminus / mineral valbaraplus / plus prism The choice of ways to discover the meaning of mathematical terms depends on the nature of the word-term, its active or passive vocabulary, the degree of belonging to the vocabulary.
Non-linguistic methods of revealing the meaning of a word are accepted in the methodology.
  The non-linguistic mode includes subject-visual examination, which in turn includes: • showing objects, pictures, actions, situations և showing films depicting events, • showing gestures, • facial expressions.
And the linguistic methods are: • discovery of the meaning in a foreign language, • discovery of the meaning in the native language.
In other words, in the first case we are dealing with a non-translational method, and in the second case with a translation method.
  In bilingual conditions, along with the mother tongue, the Russian language can be used.
Linguistic modes: non-translation և translation1. Non-translation The discovery of a word meaning in a foreign language is a non-translational method և includes: • Definition: Discovering the meaning of a word through familiar words, for example: • Listing. for example: • Synonym. Synonyms used to identify meaning should be familiar to students.
 It is necessary to focus not so much on the similarities, but on the stylistic differences, which cause difficulties in mastering synonyms, for example, nought - zero, etc.
• Antonym: • Guessing the meaning through context - a logical conclusion based on guessing the general content of the sentence, for example: In this case, even if the student does not know the meaning of the phrase equally divided, he can guess it from the general context.
During contextual input, the word unit is inserted into a vocabulary whose structure is familiar to the learner.
  The use of contextual input is not particularly difficult.
  In this case, the teacher shows the given word unit during the spoken word և immediately performs preliminary reinforcement through individual or group repetition.
 The new word unit in that case should be in the focus of perception, for which the accent, display of objects or pictures, gestures, such as the word unit on the board, writing in the notebooks, underlining it, reading and double-pronouncing are used.
• Discovering the meaning of the word by analyzing the word-formation model.
When discovering the meanings of complex derivative words, the analysis of their word's is considered key.
 When introducing new word-formation models and templates to students, it is expedient to combine the latter with new linguistic material.
  In this case, it becomes more productive, because the student relates to the word in different expressions and connections.
For example: • Discovery of a word in foreign և mother tongues, especially on the basis of common roots in Russian (vocabularies). for example: arithmetic - arithmetic, cube - cube, diameter - diameter, geometry - geometry, etc.
  The meaning of these words is known to the students from Russian, it is necessary to pay attention only to the spelling of the pronunciation.
2. Translation: • direct translation of the word, • translation-explanation.
Students are given information on whether or not semantics match, for example, the English word square means square.
 However, it also has a public meaning, and the word Armenian square does not have that meaning.
The Armenian word point has the meaning of a mathematical եմատ punctuation mark, but it means an aquatic animal.
 But the English word point does not have that meaning.
 Point: We use the word whale to express the meaning of living water.
In order for learners to use the term correctly, they need to know the specifics of its use, which include: • the connection of the term to already known words, • the typical structures in which the term is used, • the verbal situations that are typical of the term used.
Thus, the choice of the meaning of the term lexicon depends on its nature.
 The pronunciation and spelling of the term, word formation, ambiguity, connectivity, stylistic nuances should be taken into account.
  All of these present certain difficulties in mastering.
 If the vocabulary unit presents a certain difficulty, it is more expedient to introduce it in complex versions, emphasizing the coverage of the factors presenting difficulties.
Thus, getting acquainted with the new vocabulary means: • discovering the difficulties of mastering new words related to the meaning of the word, horse,, • clarifying the purpose of learning words - productive-receptive, • choosing effective methods of entering words and discovering the meaning of words, • making words according to difficulty grouping, • perform exercises that promote pre-strengthening.
The skills provided in the initial training of the new material are included in the general system of exercises, which is aimed at the development of the verbal skills and abilities of the given material material.
The stages of the strategy for getting acquainted with the mathematical vocabulary are presented in the table below, where the goals, tasks and actions of the teacher-student are highlighted [3; 91] .stages of getting acquainted with a new vocabulary 1. verbal unit display2.

Thus, the introduction of vocabulary, including term term vocabulary, is a comprehensive, systematic process, which includes a number of functions due to the structural and semantic features of the imported word.
When teaching mathematical vocabulary, it is necessary to ensure full memorization and mastery of the features of each language unit, as well as the purposeful development of vocabulary skills, because to use them in vocabulary you need to know not only the pronunciation, grammar and structure of the word, its secondary meanings and in the language being taught, but the connectivity in the field of usage, sometimes also the place of the given word in the term system.
Thus, the introduction of linguistic material, in this case mathematical vocabulary, implies the application of differentiated, complex methods and strategies, taking into account the linguistic features of the acquisition of linguistic units, as well as the purpose, problems and content of learning.
