We raised this issue mainly due to the barbarism of the Azeri "historiography" that the Armenian statehood in this region (South Caucasus) was created artificially with the active support of foreign forces (meaning the Russian Empire), and the province of Nakhichevan, which is an integral part of its territory. In administrative-territorial terms, it was part of the "ancient Azerbaijani state" formations.
While writing the article, we will talk about "Nakhchavan province" and "Nakhchavan city" in parallel.
Nakhichevan, according to "Geography", was the 34th province of the Vaspurakan province of Great Armenia, 1220 km2. area [4, page 7].
  The province of Nakhichevan was located in the middle course of the Araks River, on its left bank.
The first historical information about Nakhichevan is given by Jurassic cuneiform sources.
 This refers to the inscription left by King Menua (810-786 BC) on the rocks of the slope of Mount Odzasar, which was discovered by geologist V. A. Igumenov in 1988.
 It is reported in that protocol. "1. Ishpuine tells Sardurord by the power of the Chaldeans, 2. Minua Ishpuinord conquered the land of Artsine (city), Ish (city) [land] (conquered).
 3. Artsikume (city) land (occupied), Ayanane (city) land occupied, (people) killed, expelled.
 4. On his return, he founded the Chaldean Temple on Bulua (mountain).
 He established order.
 5. The objects of this Khaldeinth-let-be sacrificed: (one) bull (let-be-sacrificed) to the lord of Khalde-his high, Bulua- (mountain) -on ”[14, pp. 57-58].
According to the above-mentioned protocol of Nakhichevan, during the joint reign of my son Ishpuini and Menua, during one of their invasions the Urartians crossed the left bank of the Araks, southeast of the Ararat Valley, near the city of Jugha [11, p. 210].
Movses Khorenatsi gives the oldest of the Armenian chronicles from the administrative-political point of view about the province of Nakhichevan, saying that Q.A. VI century Tigran Yervandyan. "And Anoush Zarajinkin, my daughter from Ashdak, who was still a teenager, and many other captives, as much as more than a dozen, settled on the Great Mountain of the East (Mets Masis) up to the border of Goghtan, which are the Tambat, Dastgoger, Vosgoghakert, but Vranjunik is one of them, before the fortress of Nakhjavan. եր զերիիս ավանցն Խրամ և զՋուղայ և զԽոշակունիս.
And on the other side of the river is the whole field, the head of which is Azhdanakan, until the stronghold of Nakhchavan itself ”[18, pp. 84-85].
  From the above-mentioned information provided by the historian, it can be assumed that starting from the VI century BC, Nakhichevanigavar was a royal domain of the Armenian court.
 Another piece of information reported by Movses Khorenatsi testifies that the Mardpetuni estates, which were part of the senior ministerial houses of ancient Armenia, had jurisdiction "from Atrpatakan to Tsakhsh Nakhchavan" [18, p. 105].
  This information provided by the historian gives grounds to conclude that in ancient times Nakhichevan did not belong to the Mardpetakan, but to another administrative unit, Syunik in the world [10, pp. 381-382].
In the 1st century, the Armenian court separated the province of Nakhichevan from Syunik for unknown reasons and included it in the Mardpetakan.
 As B. Harutyunyan mentions. "It is logical to think that such an administrative change was intended to separate the royal domains from the hereditary domains of the Syunik princes" [10, p. 382].
 And since the ministerial house of the Mardpetuni, which ruled over the women's treasury [12, p. 64], in turn was the controlling body of the royal domains, the court found it expedient to annex it to Nakhichevangavar.
 Most likely, until the fall of the Arshakuni throne in 428, the city and province of Nakhichevan, as a royal domain, remained under the jurisdiction of the Mardpetuni.
After the fall of the Arshakuni, the ruling house of the Mardpetuni was legally abolished, and the royal estates belonging to them, including the province of Nakhichevan, with the city of the same name, passed to the Artsruni [21, pp. 319-320].
 The city and province of Nakhichevan remained in the hereditary domains of the latter until the VIII century. In the beginning, when conditioned by the administrative-political situation in Armenia, it became the residence of the deputies of the Arab police.
During the caliphate, most Arab historians and geographers divided Armenia into four parts.
  According to this administrative division, Nakhichevan (Nashavan), Vaspurakan (Basfurajan), Dvin (Dabil), Shirak (Siraj), Tayk (Tayr), Bagrand (Baghravand) were part of the third Armenia [13, pp. 16-17].
  It is noteworthy that Nakhichevan is mentioned separately from Vaspurakan, a circumstance that allows us to assume that the city of Nakhichevan, with its province of the same name, was taken out of the hereditary territories of the Artsrunis and became an administrative unit subject to the Arabs.
 It remained under Arab rule until the 9th century. the middle.
  Nakhichevan interested the Arabs in its position both as a province of military and economic significance and as an administrative-political unit.
Judging by the IX century. From the information provided by the historian Tovma Artsruni [5, p. 404], in 705. After the burning of the Armenian ministers in the churches of Nakhichevan and Khrami, the Arab general Kashm (Kasim) separated Nakhichevan from Vaspurakan, as it had already become the residence of the deputies of the Arab police of Armenia. "And the order taken by Mahmet was unjust, it was ordered by someone named Kasmo, who was his new commander in the side of the city of Nakhchivan" [16, pp. 32-33].
 T. Hakobyan mentions. "In the centuries following these events, Nakhichevan did not firmly belong to any of the ministerial houses bordering Syunik and Artsrunyats, but a bone of contention between the above-mentioned government houses" [8, p. 35].
  In our opinion, it is unlikely that the above-mentioned ministerial houses, exhausted after such a blow, would be able to enter into an active struggle for control of Nakhichevan.
It is possible to think that IX c. In the middle of the 19th century, along with the weakening of the Arab domination, the princes of Syunik reigned, extending their dominions south to the Araks River, taking over the city of Nakhichevan province, [22, p. 183].
 The fact that the latter were in the domain of the Syunik princes is confirmed by the following report by Tovma Artsruni, according to which after the death of Prince Derenik of Vaspurakan (886) his three sons divided Vaspurakan. "... բար found an irresistible good, giving my part of the world to Ashot, as you said, the best means of secular power in the rest of the world, until the end of Nakhchavan" [5, p. 374].
However, the province of Nakhchavan and the city remained in the hands of the Syunik princes until the 10th century. the beginnings.
 According to Shapuh Bagratuni's "Historiography", King Smbat I, expanding the Bagratuni territories, conquered Partav, Syunik, Nakhichevan, Yernjak, Vagharshavan, Basen, Apahunik, Hark և Taron [15, p. 50].
Thus, the province of Nakhichevan with its city again became a royal domain, which explained the circumstance of Smbat I giving Nakhichevan to the Artsrunis and the Syuniks in exchange for certain services.
 It was at this time that a great controversy arose around the city of Nakhichevan among the "princes of Artsrunyats" of Syunik, the occasion of which, after the death of Ashot Artsruni in 905, was the dedication of King Smbat I, Nakhichevan, to Prince Smbat of Syunik in exchange for certain services.
The city of Nakhichevan did not remain in the hands of the Syunik princes for a long time, because after the assassination of King Smbat I, it became the residence of Nsir, the deputy of Amira Yusuf of Atrpatakan [17, p. 143].
In fact, after the invasions of the ruler of Atrpatakan, Nakhichevan was administratively and territorially separated from Syunik to the past, where an emirate was formed [20, p. 125].
Thus, Nakhichevan should belong to one of the Armenian ministerial houses with the right of supreme ownership of the land.
  After the royal throne, even if the city of Nakhichevan passed through its province to the ruling houses of Artsrunyats or Syunyats, it was for a very short time, because its administrative-political-military significance was so great that foreign conquerors kept it under their domination.
X d. 70s Armenian Shah Ashh III Voghormatsin managed to establish his rule in Nakhichevan.
 We have received the proclamation of Ashot III the Merciful to donate estates to St. Stepanos Nakhavka Monastery not far from Nakhichevan, the letter of the institution of Catholicos Khachik to King Ashot III regarding the estates donated to Nakhavka Monastery նույն the gift of Ashot III's daughter Hripsime. "NIE (976) Tumaris Aramian ... By an irrevocably high order, you have established a status for our subject, which was determined by our ancestors, from our holy patriarch, our lord Nersis, to our holy Enlightener, first of all, the glorious, free, famous capital. Giran, Jughayur Jur monastery, Astapat ևyur monastery, Shamb ևyur monastery, Jaghats place ևyur monastery, Ararq ևyur monastery… ”[1, pp. 2-11].
 According to this document, Ashot III the Merciful came to the monastery of St. Stepanos Nakhavka in Magharda in 976. He dedicated Nakhichevan and large estates from other surrounding provinces to the monastery.
 This fact can not be interpreted other than the annexation of the Araks valley south of Dvin to the Bagratuni kingdom, or at least the reality of its domination [9, p. 116].
It can be assumed that Nakhichevan, along with other royal domains, came under Byzantine rule in 1045, after the fall of the Armenian statehood.
This administrative-political situation was rather short.
  In 1063, the Seljuk sultan Alpaslan captured the city of Nakhichevan, making it his residence.
 During the Seljuk rule, it became a powerful administrative center, where an emirate was formed.
 The power of the Emir of Nakhichevan extended to Southeastern Armenia and Atrpatakan [3, pp. 217-218].
 The Seljuk period of rule in Nakhichevan ends in the 12th century. It is not accidental that Elik Orbelyan, who had reached a high position in Atrpatakan as a "military agent of these parties", took over the city and its environs in Nakhiche. In the middle of the 19th century, after which the city and province passed to the Eltkuzyan Atabatak of Atrpatakan, becoming one of the most important military and administrative strongholds.
  The latter became the hereditary domain and seat of the Orbelian ruling house with its province [17, pp. 8, 280-288].
XII century The recently liberated North-Eastern Armenia was divided among the Zakaryans.
  The city of Nakhichevan և its environs fell to Ivane Atabek [6, p. 154].
 Nakhichevan did not stay in the Zakaryans for a long time.
 1225 The provinces of Armenia received a heavy blow from the Shah of Khorezm, Jalal ad-Din.
 Among other provinces of Armenia, Nakhichevan is also destroyed [2, p. 499].
 Later, Jalal ad-Din settled in Atrpatakan, making the city of Nakhichevan his residence [19, p. 52].
 The latter remained in the hands of Jalal-ad-Din for a short time.
At the request of the townspeople, they appealed to Malik al-Ashraf's deputy (deputy) Hajib Hussam al-Din, who was sitting in Khlat, and the town handed him over. "The point is that Jalal al-Din had a bad attitude towards the people and the army was looting," he wrote. Ibn al-Asir [3, p. 334].
These administrative-political changes lasted until 1236, when the Mongols, conquering the whole of Northeastern Armenia, made administrative divisions.
 Nakhichevan, together with Georgia and Northeastern Armenia, was part of the vilayet of Georgia, the center of which was Tbilissi (Georgia).
Soon the fourth tuman was formed in Northeastern Armenia, which included Nakhichevan (the territory of Nakhchavan-Goght provinces of Vaspurakan province - HP) with the power of Syunik.
 However, Syunik soon seceded from the vilayet of Georgia, becoming a tuman directly subordinate to the Mongol khans [7, pp. 356-358].
 XIV century Recently, with the administrative division of Lenk Temur, Nakhichevan formed one administrative unit with Armenia and South Atrpatakan, the head of which was called Emirate.
 The latter's residence was in the cities of Tabriz [7, pp. 358-361].
 The state created by Lenk-Temur had a short life.
 After his death, that vast state disintegrated very quickly, and the nomadic Kara-Kunlu-Akkoyunlu tribes established their rule in Armenia.
 XV century During the reign of the above-mentioned nomadic tribes, the Tuman-e Nakhichevan administrative unit was gradually formed, which included a larger area than the Nakhchavan province of Nakhchivan (Goght province of Vaspurakan province, as well as Tsghuk Vaghay, Jahor, Yaghor, Syunik province, - H. P.).
Thus, Nakhichevan, with its exceptional administrative and political significance, has played a great role throughout the history of Armenia, both in the conditions of independence and its absence.
  It has been one of the provinces of Greater Armenia of great administrative and political significance since ancient times, which never lost its administrative and political significance during the study period, as an organic part of Greater Armenia, it is one of the inseparable components of the homeland of the Armenian people.
