Modern Armenian literature is rich in biographical novels.
 The critique of time reflects them to one degree or another.
 In their articles, S. Sarinyan [11, 13, 14] raised various issues related to biographical novels. Kalantaryan [20], S. Margaryan [15], D. Gasparyan [4, 16], Z. Avetisyan [2], G. Khachikyan [7, 8], we, the author of the article [10]։ others.
 The authors of biographical novels in very few cases single out the nature of their novels. just mention the novel.
  In the article we have focused our attention on the literary analysis of Haykaz Habobjanyan's "My life was so difficult" և Ashot Avetisyan's biographical novels "The Lonely Star".
Vahan Teryan opened a chapter in Armenian poetry; it can be said that none of our poets had such a large number of followers.
His works were highly appreciated by famous literary critics A. Terteryan, E. Jrbashyan, S. Sarinyan, R. Ishkhanyan, H. Tamrazyan, D. Gasparyan և others.
 Academician E. Jrbashyan dedicated two monographs to Teryan's works: "Four peaks.
 Tumanyan, Usahakyan, Teryan, Charents "[18] և" Vahan Teryan's grammatical system "[19].
 The reflection of Teryan's image in biographical novels was expected.
The authors of biographical novels, of course, should use the monographs, memoirs and letters written about the writers.
 Sometimes the fact that the authors are literary scholars is noticed in the novels.
 There are disagreements in the literature regarding the novels of the best master of the biographical novel Tinyanov. Some consider them historical novels, some biographical novels, and others philological novels. moreover, he is considered the founder of that subgenre of the novel.
  In Terj Hakobjanyan's novel, elements of a philological novel can be noticed, but in philological novels the observations of the writer-literary critic merge with the artistic texture of the novel.
 We consider Ashot Avetisyan's novel purely biographical, although the opinions of literary critics about the philological novel are, in our opinion, controversial.
Haykaz Hakobjanyan is the author of three biographical novels: "White Edelweiss. R. "Light", "Flashing lamp. D. Varuzhan "," O human justice. Siamanto ", the preface of which was written by Academician S. Sarinyan.
  It seemed that the writer's experience should become an experience և the last novel would be the best.
  But the biographical novel written about Teryan has serious shortcomings.
The novel consists of four parts.
 The first chapter is about the poet's birth, childhood, student և views and formation as a poet.
  "Tizivava", Lalkan Vanik becomes Vahan Teryan.
  Hakobjanyan presents Teryan's proclamation as a poet more from the point of view of an ethnographer than from the point of view of a writer.
"Sincere to the last sincere" Teryan, with his dreams, ideals, longings and feelings, the mystery of love opens in the second part.
 According to the author, his great and true love was Antaram Miskaryan, but Teryan married Susanna Pakhalova, who seemed inaccessible.
  The lyrical outburst anticipating the future follows: "What is Love, which is considered a mysterious gift? He is a wild beast with neglected clutches, he can sleep under your caress in your arms ... ”[13, pp. 166-167].
The writer introduces Teryan as a loving, caring husband, but he suffered in love because he was not understood.
  The inner anxieties and fears of the poet are delicately drawn.
When presenting Teryan's "The Coming Day of Armenian Literature" և "Careful Armenia" reports, the critic is the primary one among the author.
 When Teryan says that one of Tumanyan's "Parvana" will not change with the works of suddenly pagan Istanbul-Armenian poets, Hakobjanyan opposes. "Unfortunately, Teryan did not understand the main essence of the" pagan literary movement "that had emerged in the literature of Western Armenian culture at the beginning of the century and had created powerful literary and cultural values ​​..." [13, p. 249].
  The "pagan" literary movement gave an opportunity to soar above the cruel reality of the Armenian-Armenians, it was the imperative of the day to bring literature strength, courage, beauty and freedom, to inject them into the national consciousness.
  High-quality literary gems were created in the field of this literature, the best expression of which was D. It was Varuzhan's work.
The third chapter leaves the impression of a historical overview.
 He tells about the poet's attitude towards the historical and historical events of the Genocide, then quotes from Teryan's poems and Vache Partizuni's analysis. For the poet who bears the "Nairian high-suffering" in his soul, the issue of the state of the Armenian "bloodthirsty people" had become a "phantom", the issue of all questions.
 The song-poem "Yerkir Nairi" was born and eaten from this "phantom", which, according to Charents, became a "treasury of Nairi words".
  The difference from a literary monograph or a critical article is expressed only in the fact that the writer brings the passage without reference to details.
  Then he quotes from Charents' poem. "Ah, you seem to be at the door, you are reading Teryan with me" [13, pp. 279-280].
  With a detailed presentation of the passage, we point out that the writer's idea is missing here.
The author hints at Teryan's patriotic activities, quotes extensively from the "On Turkey-Armenia" decree. The facts brought by Teryan complement the writer's "historical excursion".
  The poet's naive belief that the establishment of the Soviet power will solve the centuries-old dreams of Armenians is presented here, he tells about the poet as an adviser, a member of the delegation, participating in the signing of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, and carrying out translation activities.
  The poet's firstborn dies.
Susanna does not write anything. "When the mother is silent, mountains and stones will cry out in pain, screaming heartily, because չկա there is no other innocent angel" [13, p. 322].
The woman is slowly being alienated from the poet buried in state affairs. The author gently presents the longing for Antaram Miskaryan. The inner voice of the author և the hero, united and united, rebuke, urge the hero, to participate in his sufferings and pains, sometimes not noticing whether it is the monologue of the hero or the author's thought. "Where is Antyan… Is he happy with Petrov? I'm tired, take care of me, be tender and gentle ... Avoid the dark doubts, put the bile of despair on your feet." Go ahead ”[13, p. 341].
The expression of the ideal and the dream is Antenka. It is immature and unrequited love, mysterious and captivating, misunderstood and unappreciated.
 The real one is Susanna, whose character is mysterious, dark as night.
She is not a loving husband, she can just be the first.
 The removal of the woman had matured.
 They were far from each other because of the civil war, the return was impossible, և Teryan had only the pain of division.
 The poet's grandson does not agree with this comment; the woman's act was considered an escape and abandonment by Teryan's closest friend, Al. With Myasnikyan [5, pp. 35-36].
 It should be noted that Ashot Avetisyan also left this issue in suspense.
 Apparently, the authors could not penetrate into the dark folds of Teryan և Susanna's personal life.
  The novels would benefit more from that psychologically.
In the last chapter, the events develop incomparably faster. The poet is sick and alone. His wife, Susanna, complained of incurable pain, which he sarcastically called a "poetic disease."
 He is doing a great job of translation, he is happy with the establishment of the First Republic of Armenia, with the heroic battles of Bash-Aparan and Sardarpat, he is alarmed that the existence of the country's independence is endangered.
  The physically exhausted and sick poet appears dreamily captivating and tender Anahit Shahijanyan, who knows his poems by heart.
 Anahit is pregnant, and she has important state assignments.
 And the end with known factual details.
Hakobjanyan generously involved letters, memoirs, testimonies, made extensive quotations.
 The main source of biographical novels is the writers' letter.
  Even the well-known literary critic Tinyanov, who played a fundamental role in the biographical novel genre, made extensive use of the letter [23, pp. 9-17], but the composer must be careful not to overwhelm the narrative with letters, when they are available to the reader, the first light. no.
The writer uses Teryan's style, but even in this case it is sometimes noticed when the author's story ends, or what is the direct quotation from Teryan's letters and poems.
 Hakobjanyan pays great attention to the formation and revelation of Teryan's spiritual world, his beautiful features of character, which contributed to the letter left by the poet.
 When depicting the difficult life of the poet, he especially tries to present him as "naked in spirit", and the poet was so sincere mainly before Antaram Miskaryan.
The novel is documentary in nature, of course, with some artistic features, as the documentary novel is not devoid of fiction.
 The writer even cites the source of the fact, quotes extensively from letters with a certain date.
  For example: "In 1884. Aram Ter-Grigoryan writes in "Taraz" "[13, 14]," Here is a piece from the master's memoirs "[13, p. 66]," Teryanologist Sako Sukiasyan writes "[13, p. 387] Extensive quotes.
 The following books are the source of factual material used by the author: Teryan's collection of works (1-4, Yerevan, 1972-1979), "Vahan Teryan in the memories of contemporaries" (Yerevan, 1964), Vache Partizuni, Teryan's biography (Yerevan, 1984), Sako Sukiasyan "Pages from Vahan Teryan's life" (Yerevan, 1959), "Vahan Teryan. Letters "(to Antaram Miskaryan) (Yerevan, 1972), H. Tamrazyan, "Vahan Teryan" (Yerevan, 1985).
 Academician H. The last chapter of Tamrazyan's "Vahan Teryan" monograph is called "The way of the poet's brotherhood (with Charents)".
  Tamrazyan presents Charents's attitude to Teryan and brings his poem "In memory of Vahan Teryan" [7, 219228].
 Hakobjanyan նույն ends his novel in the same way, according to Charents, with the poem "In memory of Vahan Teryan".
  However, if the writer's dependence on other literary critics is indirect, then Hakobjanyan's dependence on Vache Partizuni's books is obvious, even in terms of the title.
 Let's compare "The life story of Vache Partizuni, Teryan", he used the first line of the poem with the same title "And my life was so difficult" as the original, Hakobjanyan titled his book "My life was so difficult. Vahan Teryan. in life. "
The lack of archival-factual materials used by Hakobjanyan is conditioned by the fact that the author is far from his homeland, in France.
  That reality significantly affected the novel. it has only cognitive significance.
The lack of data leaves the novel incomplete,, Hakobjanyan Teryan is a polished and polished, purely poetic character known to us, վել correctly interpreted.
 The author felt that a lot was left unfinished ում In the "As an end" section, presenting his book, he writes: "Forgive my mistakes" [13, p. 390].
Ashot Avetisyan's novel "The Lonely Star" has a different quality.
 Here գր the biography of the writer is presented from childhood to death.
 Teryanikper develops in the natural environment, and that was first of all the family.
  The poet's brothers presented the writer's life, family, and even their occupation to their relatives quite thoroughly and interestingly.
 It is up to the writer to include all this in the realm of epic actions.
  But it "requires this skill", the writer is presented through the dialogues, thoughts and authorial narration of the heroes.
  The events develop in a natural way, and the artistic characters are formed in a typical environment.
 The environment is convincing, as the author is Teryan's compatriot.
The novelist did a thorough, serious work of a literary critic, studied the archival, little-known factual material.
  When introducing the plot of the novel, the author preserves the literary independence, the nature in the epic domain.
 For example, the Russian writer Leonid Bolshakov was able to find traces of the "princess Na" mentioned by Teryan: an Armenian girl "who, fleeing from the enemy's slaughter and finding refuge in distant Buluzuk, came to look for relatives" [3, p. 46].
 In Ashot Avetisyan's novel, Poghos Makintsyan, clarifying from Vahan Teryan about the heroine of lyric poetry, says: "I also thought that you have found a wonderful lady like Blok and dedicate poems to her.
 _ ._No, it will not be like the Block series ”[1, p. 347].
With that, he points out that Teryan's mysticism is not a result of influence, but an independent direction with an individual stamp.
 Literary critics confirm this.
  The writer manages to present Teryan with a neutral position, the main character is revealed to the reader not as the author's obvious love and affection, but as a result of self-knowledge.
The novel presents the complete image of Vahan Teryan with the formation of views, searches, loves, doubts, aspirations, encouragements and disappointments.
 Here are the political life of the time, the reactions of ordinary people and intellectuals to political events.
It is impossible to imagine a biographical novel without the people around the hero.
  Lightly or strongly expressed, they nevertheless complete the epic environment.
  Teryan teacher Karapet Kusikyan is a full-fledged character, who played a big role in shaping his views, with whom he remained close until the end of his life.
 The Armenian-Russian intellectuals, the literary directions of the time, the political life are presented.
 The controversy over the image of Teryan's closest friend, Poghos Makintsyan, is fully presented after the people became the People's Commonwealth of Internal Affairs.
  Their alienation from each other is seen in the dialogue.
  After Brusov and his wife և Teryan were invited by the Armenian Catholicos, Poghos said: "Didn't you nail your nails in the pulpit either?"
  Otherwise, you would have severely insulted our elegant and insightful Catholicos ”[1, p. 358].
 This seems suspicious to Teryan. Does he speak out of jealousy, or is he really upset about everything?
 Makintsyan dismissed the teachers from the seminary who were not enthusiastic about the Soviet regime.
  Suren Khachatryan, who opened an art studio at the lyceum with Teryan 's support, does not include Makintsyan in the list of lecturers, saying that he has nothing to do with him.
  At the end of their lives we do not find the coldness of their relationship in Hakobjanyan's novel.
 This proves that Avetisyan is well aware of the material.
The presented citizen Teryan is especially interesting.
The author introduced the poet with new, modern ideas.
  With the change of the new classes, Teryan remains the same conscious patriot.
  He frees Dashnak doctor Zavri from the shooting, which costs him dearly, and they establish tense relations with Avanesov.
 The poet is concerned about the state of the intelligentsia. He feels pain that the intelligentsia is in a difficult situation,, equally, regardless of party affiliation, he gives positions to his relatives, distributes money to immigrants, visitors.
  The author also says that Teryan was going to write a poem about the heroic battle of Van.
  We are not sure whether he is familiar with the originals of the memoirs written by Teryan's advisers.
  We are more inclined to the opinion that Avetisyan is familiar with the fact. From the Partisan Books [17, pp. 284-286].
 The poet's grandson G. Emin-Teryan in 2016 published "Vahan Teryan's unknown initiative. Memoirs of Armenian Orphans Until now, the documents were inaccurate, they were kept in the wrong archive, that is, the researcher could find them only by chance ”[6, p. 5].
Former lyceum teacher Barsegh Gasparyan is also angry with the poet (he dedicated Teryan's first poems entitled "Blood" to his daughter Nyura, the opposite inscription of Nyura's name is "Blood> Nyura"). Instead of engaging in literature, Teryan spreads the new rules. They demolished and destroyed everything.
  And when Teryan asks Nura, he explodes that he should have asked that question.
 Relations with the Bolsheviks are gradually strained.
  The "care" shown by the poet - sending him on leave for treatment - proves that he is being removed from the arena.
At first Teryan had a naive belief in the Soviet regime, in Lenin. "She is bright and amazing."
  And when Susanna asks if they say that dozens of people have been shot every day, she answers that they are gossip. "If they crack, then they had to crack" [1, p. 405].
 The ill-fated Brest-Litovsk Treaty is signed, Prosh Proshyan leaves the Bolshevik government.
Teryan was depressed. "Russia, whether tsarist or Soviet, would live and survive in Russia.
  And his country ... ”[1, p. 408].
  The book accurately presents the establishment of Soviet rule with its brutality, which would later lead to atrocities.
Not all facts need to be included in biographical novels, but the accuracy of the fact is mandatory.
  In this respect, the observation of the author-biographer-theorist Andre Morua is interesting. "I do not invent situations or words ... I rely on the facts that I find in documents, letters, newspapers, memoirs. I cling to the fact as demandingly as the authors of university dissertations և professional erudites ”[22, pp. 46-47].
  Ashot Avetisyan accurately used the epistles, which are revealed by the historical truth.
In 2011 the novel was awarded the WUA Derenik Demirchyan Prize.
 Literary critic Zaven Avetisyan, referring to the novel in the August 25 issue of "Aravot" daily, ruled out fiction (in a negative sense), which we cannot say about Hakobjanyan's novel.
 Ahanra gave a high assessment to the novel. "As a result of the author's talent, rich knowledge, creative perseverance and suffering, a book has been created, which, I am sure, will receive the attention and approval of a wide range of readers" [2, p. 6].
Conclusion. Two biographical novels have been written about Teryan.
 Each of the authors has created Teryan's artistic image with his own ideas.
  Hakobjanyan is directed to the expression of Teryan's feelings in the world; he leaves out the formation and development of his literary taste, և his political views.
 Ashot Avetisyan creates the full, complete image of a writer.
 Hakobjanyan presents Teryan with more ideal features, in Avetisyan's novel as a living personality.
 Avetisyan is not dependent on sources. The sky is perceived as an independent work of art.
  Avetisyan's novel ranks higher than Hakobjanyan's novel, but as a work of art, it is perfect.
 Davit Gasparyan, speaking about the demands of modern literature, quoting Hemingway's idea that "in writing one should reach the truth, to correct, not to describe", concludes. "There is a big difference between describing and reflecting this."
  And ours still tells a long and thin story ”[4, p. 97].
Both Avetisyan and Hakobjanyan remained within the simplest framework of description-narration.
  That is why both novels have at least cognitive significance.
