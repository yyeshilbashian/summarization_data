 Many researchers who study the concept of "politeness" clearly distinguish between polite and rude peoples.
 In our opinion, in reality there are no more or less polite peoples.
  Every nation is polite in its own way.
 For example, the Russian people, like the German people, are no less polite than the British or the Koreans, if we take into account their national mentality, behavior or cultural values.
As for the French, their image is characterized by cheerful, cheerful, at the same time polite, courageous luxuries.
 Politeness is an integral part of the daily life of the French.
 From a very early age, the French teach children the basic rules of etiquette: verbal, non-verbal, non-verbal.
  The French have always tried to maintain their reputation for being polite, using various communication strategies ություն appropriateness, regardless of their position and sphere of social activity.
  Being aware of all the norms of politeness already means being polite and polite.
The French attach great importance to good behavior and politeness.
Now the norms of politeness in French culture have been simplified, although the attitude of the French towards the norms of politeness remains unchanged.
 It was և the kind attitude towards the environment remains, which is vividly proved by the following sayings: To this day, the French use the words au revoir for greeting or farewell, accompanied by the words Madame և Monsieur.
 It is considered rude if those words are not used with the words "Mrs." or "Mr."
 When communicating with neighbors or strangers, the French keep their distance.
 The French strictly adhere to the requirement of the expression chacun chez soi և try to burden each other with personal problems.
One of the peculiarities of the French is the order of inviting them to dinner, they do it a week or even a month in advance.
As it is customary to say among the French: "Avant l'heure, c'est pasl'heure, après l'heure, c'est plus l'heure". It should be added that the French never go to dinner without an invitation.
The French are very punctual.
 This is evidenced by the thought of Louis XVIII - "L'exactitude est la politesse des rois".
 Punctuality is one of the most important imperatives in life sciences.
 As for business meetings, it is recommended to attend the meeting five or ten minutes early, as punctuality is considered a sign of politeness and confidence.
  However, there is also the law "le quart d'heure de tolérance", which always helps to avoid a failed meeting.
  But in any case, the delay in such meetings is considered as rude, irresponsible attitude.
The approach to informal meetings is different.
  Today, the French are quite tolerant of delays, even twenty minutes is not considered a delay.
  According to the French, these regulations allow the host party to properly prepare for the scheduled meeting.
 The other rule is that the higher the guest status, the more likely he is to be late.
  Referring to the procedure of meetings in the business world, it should be noted that it is customary to interrupt the interlocutor to express a critical comment.
  In this case, it is customary for women to address Madame politely, regardless of their marital status.
 A handshake is generally accepted.
Referring to another verbal situation, that is, the telephone conversation, it should be noted that it occupies a very important place for the French.
  This form of communication also has the rules of etiquette, which are completely in line with the principles of negative etiquette, which the French follow, because friendly, civilized communication depends on the tone of voice.
The other most important feature of French politeness is that they call each other very early in the morning, after 9 pm, to report something new.
 During a telephone conversation, the French first introduce themselves, then say who they would like to talk to, for example, Allô, ici Robert H., pourrais-je parler àMonsieur X.? If the person is not in place, it is preferable to respond with a polite answer: Monsieur X. is sorti, voulez-vous me laisser votre nom pour qu'il vousrappelle? It should be noted that during the telephone communication, the French are very friendly, they behave more than civilized.
Politeness is a flexible system of different verbal acts.
A strategy of positive politeness implies intimacy with the interlocutor, reduction of distance, and showing mutual respect, regardless of the close relationship with the interlocutor, is a strategy of negative politeness.
 Positive expressions of politeness are aimed at bringing the interlocutors closer, showing mutual sympathy; they are more related to the interlocutor, whose main function is to express the feelings of the interlocutor (for example, greeting, assessment, compliment, etc.).
 Negative courtesy, the main purpose of which is to show personal respect for the addressee, is first and foremost related to the coercive verbal act.
  For this work, the study of eloquent acts was important, because when studying the verbal acts of Armenian-French-speaking communicators, differences in the behavior of different cultures are revealed.
  Let us examine the verbal act expressing a request.
A request is a compulsory verbal act, the supposed actions of which are related to the actions carried out within the interests of the communicators.
  Moreover, the executor of the request has a clear freedom, which allows him to perform or not to perform the given action.
In Armenian, the verb to ask / please - the phrase be kind / has a pronounced functional value և application.
  It is not by chance that they call it a "magic" word.
  When used with an imperative, it changes the command to a request, making the imperative request a form of polite expression.
 It may be subject to change in tone.
 The French s'il te / vous plaît ձ is fully equivalent to the above-mentioned Armenian expression in its functional value.
  At the same time in French the use of the template s'il te / vous plaît is desirable, even if it is used in parallel with the verb prier.
/ Please pass it on.
The purpose of the change is not to soften the demand, but to make it more pronounced.
Ayez l'amabilité / Be kind - Avoir l'amabilité de Ayez la bonté de / Welcome / Be kind - Avoir la bonté de The frequency of application is decreasing.
Phrases such as Aidez - moi, s'il vous plaît. Ne fumez pas, s'il vous plaît are described as low-level politeness or courtesy.
  Preference is given to more extended expressions: / Ne / Pourriez-vous / pas / However, expressions such as, for example, Entrez! Can be expressed more politely արտահայտ by adding s`ilvous plaît or Je vous en prie with a polite tint .
Orientation questions are often used in expressions used to perform actions in Armenian և French.
  These can be questions that guide the interlocutor to perform the given action.
 For example, would you not say what time it is?
 Couldn't you come tomorrow?
    Pourriez vous me dire l`heure, Ne pourriez - vous pas venirdemain ?:
 In French, the conditional tense is used not only to express possible or possible actions, but also as a complete structure in expressions of politeness.
  Negative particles are mainly used to indicate the degree of politeness, as it implies a dual response և gives the interlocutor the opportunity to choose the answer.
From the analysis made it becomes clear that in order to make the word polite more meaningful, in both Armenian and French cultures the verb to ask is more often used.
 In the studied languages, the use of that verb և the templates created by it is carried out equally.
 In both languages ​​it has the value of a magic word.
The request is most often formulated with the help of the imperative mood of the verb և "please" վում accompanied by such expressions as: Sois aimable, s`il te plaît, si tu veux que je te parle sérieusement! Be careful, s'il te plaît! Please be kind.
Please, if you want, I can talk to you kindly.
The request can also be expressed in a conventional way or with the help of the verb "to be able".
Est ce que je peux vous demander / Can I ask you?
Pourriez-vous transmittedtre / Can you transfer?
Puis-je vous demander de / Can I ask you?
The Puis-je structure used in the last template is used to soften the request.
       Thus, the problem of studying the concept of "politeness" is urgent, because without the basic principles of politeness it is impossible to imagine the effective communication of peoples belonging to different cultures and civilizations.
  From the point of view of intercultural communication, the concept of "politeness" is a typical national type of communication, the main and characteristic part of the content of which are linguistic and linguistic communication systems.
