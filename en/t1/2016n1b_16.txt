As it is known, the boundary separating the micro-macro-elements from each other is generally quite conditional and unclear.
  Classical notions are often useful in micronutrient observations, and quantum mechanics are useful in macroeconomic evaluations.
 In particular, the general nature of statistical patterns does not depend significantly on how the behavior of individual particles in the system is interpreted, classical or quantum, although their rationale in these two cases requires different judgments.
Especially since there is a random factor in the behavior of micro-objects.
  That is, quantum mechanics is fundamentally statistical, the source of the statistical nature of quantum mechanics is the same as classical statistical mechanics, that is, the existence of a large number of connections that affect an object (both classical and quantum).
 In quantum theory, the nature of random effects on a micro-object is due to the interactions of the vacuum with the micro-object, which lead to quantum fluctuations in the object's behavior.
  Thus, the probable nature of statistical description results (as in classical statistics) is due not so much to the physical nature of the object under consideration as to the fact that these results are obtained on the basis of much less information than is necessary for a complete mechanical description.
  Thus, the interpretation of quantum phenomena uses statistical notions, in particular the idea of ​​entropy, which in turn enabled Planck to express the well-known formula for the energy spectral density of thermal radiation [3, 4].
As an example of the above approach, let us consider the reasoning for the existence of the phenomenon of forced radiation from the point of view of the second law of thermodynamics.
 The rationale for such an observation is due to the general nature of thermodynamics, which in its ideological basis includes the features and effects of quantization without changing the basis of thermodynamic approaches to the interpretation of phenomena [3].
 In quantum statistics, one has only to consider the fact that the concept of entropy is reinterpreted from the state of a system corresponding to a certain value of energy, in contrast to classical statistics, where entropy is simply defined as a logarithm of the phase  volume of the system [2, 5].
For simplicity, consider a set of two-level N atoms with fundamentally basic states that are in equilibrium with electromagnetic radiation.
 Let us unite the subatomics of evaporates and radiation into one closed, separate system.
  As is well known, the following statements are derived from Boltzmann's kinetic equation: [5] • the entropy of a system can be altered to a certain extent by entropy inflows or outflows, as in the case of entropy production at volume, • closed system entropy to grow, or, in the conditions of the implementation of the principle of careful equilibrium, to remain stable.
Let us now consider the opposite problem, which is based on the second law of increasing entropy thermodynamics (according to which in an unbalanced system the processes proceed in such a way that the system continuously transitions from a low entropy state to a higher entropy state until the entropy reaches full maturity). to substantiate the maximum possible value) as a consequence of the necessity of the existence of forced transitions in the closed system of atoms և electromagnetic radiation, in addition to spontaneous transitions.
 Such a question can serve as a basis for a general approach to the possible outcomes of quantum mechanical processes և նշանակ have the significance of alternative observation.
  Since entropy is an averaged characteristic of the process for the period t որոշակի, which cannot be infinitesimally small [2], it must be assumed that for N-atomic subsystems, electromagnetic radiation (n-photons subsystem) can interact in separate phases. the idea of ​​entropy.

  Specifically the simplest hydrogen atoms. Here for the subsystem of atomic electrons, where, where is the principal quantum number.
 And in the case of photons, for the energy subsystem, which is in a state, the degree of perversion:
, because in the case of fixed frequency and direction of propagation, the quantum of light, the photon, can have two independent directions of charge.
 In the absence of interaction in the output state, the entropy of the system (taking into account the additiveness of entropy) where as the lower part of the orystem ակարգ

- The full number of atomic electrons at the N - atomic energy level is the main. And suppose in the first stage of the interaction, absorbing the same number of atoms, light quanta, pass through the multiplicity, 2
 The entropy of the system after such a transition.
                                      (7) Naturally, the 1  direct transition corresponds to the law of increasing entropy of the closed system.
Really because which is obviously happening.
In the second stage of the interaction, 2  anti-3 N atoms are realized, protons are photons, they return to the starting state, system-to-system transitions.
 In the case of such transitions, when the same h
Entropy will be given by the following expression: where?

The change (increase) in the entropy of the system is directly 1 ման with the transition .
Changes in the entropy of the system with a 2 և transition. (decline) reverse It is easy to notice that in this case the following is true.

Here is the full probability of a direct transition, taking into account the finite width, energy, N - atoms of 1, the amplitude of the wave electromagnetic field, t - the transition time, - the square of the dipole moment [6].
Spontaneous (spontaneous) transition does not depend on the time of 3 N, the interpretation does not guarantee the fulfillment of condition (14), because on the left of (14) there is an obvious time dependence, which is absent on the right (voluntary transition is a random process) .
 It remains to be ascertained the existence of a complementary equilibrium 2  transition, which takes place with a probability of time-dependence.2 N - the number of atoms in 2 states.
  But - where - is the probability of passing.
  In this way, the need for forced radiation can be conditioned.
OppositeLet's create (

It can be confirmed that the case was discussed above, from the physical point of view).
         Thus, in the case of a thorough imbalance.
 (It should be noted that the case is devoid of: the entropy of the observed closed system necessarily increases.
 Indeed, the energy exchange (forced absorption, spontaneous-forced delivery) of energy in a closed system of atomic radiation is accompanied by non-monotonous, non-targeted scattering of energy due to the presence of an atomic shock impulse (energy) during photon absorption and delivery.
  The asymmetry of such spontaneously occurring phenomena, ie one-way, leads to an increase in the entropy of the system in case of disturbance of the fine balance.
 And in the case of equilibrium, when the average number of acts of absorption and delivery is averaged, the average loss of atomic energy is absent (the entropy of the system remains constant).
As we know, classical mechanics is perfectly proportional to the two directions of time, so given the invariance of the equations of classical mechanics with respect to the change of time, one can conclude the idea of ​​a monotonous change in entropy.
  However, in order to get the law of monotonic growth of entropy, it is necessary to fix the fact of time correction.
  The idea of ​​the inequality of the two directions of time is rooted in equantine mechanics, so the existence of the law of entropy growth is based on quantum mechanical observations.
  The above-mentioned 2  reverse և revelations of forced radiation can serve as an example.
 Indeed, the reality of the existence of transitions necessarily determines the fact that the 2  process result time corrects, since the probability of the 1  process result is predetermined by the 1  transient, which can occur only if it has gone before 2 ((which is obvious).
1  ևAnd as we have seen above, the regular inequality of time's atoms of 2N atoms leads to the conclusion of an increase in the entropy of a closed system.
  Thus, in quantum mechanical observations, the macroscopic generalization of the physical inequality of the two directions of time leads to the law of entropy growth.
