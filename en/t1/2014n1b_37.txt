Armenia is fully integrated into the global economy, regional policy, joint efforts to improve the living conditions of its citizens, and to maintain peace.and in order to develop.
  Armenian schools and teachers todayare related to the same obstacles.
  Education workersEverybody realizes that the old-fashioned ways of teaching and learningothers are unable to create and develop knowledge and skills that:The citizen needs to be prosperous in the knowledge economyto live life.
 Therefore, both in Armenia and everywhere, new alternative approaches to teaching and learning are needed at school.
Reaching the roots of collaborative learningare the works of John Dewey, where the author, emphasizing educationsees it as a learning mechanism that:gives citizens the ability to live by the principles of cooperation in a social-popular society [6.175].
Collaborative to solve teaching problemsTeaching is one of the tools tested by teachers.
Traditional group work can be very differentև Collaborative training.
  Many of the teachers are teachingapply group work, but few have trainingMastery necessary to integrate the main elements and methods of collaborative learning in the process.
 That's whyCollaborative learning is rarely used in the classroom or at schoolSmall group work is more like group work than collaborative learning.
“Teaching will be collaborative when studentsworking together, in pairs or in small groups, is a common taskto solve, to explore a common topic or a new idea, innovationto accomplish ”[2,18].
Collaborative teaching as an alternative pedagogical approach has gained a great deal of recognition in many countries ուսուցիչ teacher և teacher training ների trainersfrom.
 Factors contributing to its widespread use are:• Adapting teaching in the classroom to the individual characteristics of the learner;• Ability to achieve multifaceted educational goals simultaneously;• Peculiarities of teaching, modern approachesto be in tune.
The elements of collaborative learning, according to Johnson, are basically five.• positive interdependence • face-to-face interaction• Individual report և responsibility; • interpersonal or small group work skills;• Group process development.
Later one of these elements was added.
  Passy Sahlbergconsiders the interactive task as the 6th element of collaborative learning.
"The most valuable feature of group work is the cooperation between the group members."
 Effectiveness of cooperationIt depends on the methodically correct activity.
  The teacher needs:take into account students' independent opinions, decisions made,with the right to communicate freely with one another ”[1,17-24].
The use of collaborative learning elements contributes to the creation of a new collaborative environment in the classroom, helps the teacher to understand the essence and planning of the lesson, creates conditionsto evaluate and evaluate the effectiveness of teaching.
"Working with others - collaborative creativityOne of the essential conditions for making the most of workis the ability to imagine oneself in someone else's place as the other personUnderstanding the point of view gives students more opportunityto easily adapt to the demands of life ”[3,145].
Organizing collaborative training Each member of the group during the collaborative trainingor the whole class is actively involved in teaching while newKnowledge is developed and mastered through the student.
Collaborative learning uses not only the acquisition of academic knowledge and skills, but also group learning.Skilled process collaborators ակտիվ knowledge activeshaping users.
Collaboration creates a higher level of self-awarenesslevel than competitive or individual training methods can provide.
 Individuals are oriented in collaborative situationsto interact, to promote each other's success, to form a wide range of interests և to build on each other's abilitiesreal ideas, then give true feedback.
The role of the teacher in collaborative learning"The job of a teacher is one of the most widely used professions in the society, requiring the greatest ingenuity and being appreciated day by day.
 Teachers need success todaynew ways of governing and helping children, and a deeper understanding of the approaches needed for effective teaching of children ”[4,48].
Learning is a complex process that takes place within the learner.
 The teacher can only guide it, create a favorable environment for it, support և give an opportunity to think.
 Collaborative methods expect a change in the role of the teacher, և that role is full of challenges.
The teacher using collaborative training should be patient in guiding the members of the group.
 Groups need enough time to feel free and comfortable with each other.
In the case of both traditional and collaborative learning, the key to success is teacher preparation.
  Teacher:should plan not only the content approach, but also the students' actions and assessment.
Collaborative learning methodsThere are different methods of collaborative learning,which have both similarities and differences.
  Below:We present a number of methods of collaborative learning.
 They:Student team progress, mosaic, tourin the gallery, three keys և one lock, free for five minutesessay.
1. Student team progress method.
  Collaborative:This teaching method was developed by a professor at Johns Hopkins UniversityBy Robert Slavin.
  This method stimulates students' learning.
 The fact that the students' progress is evaluated is important here.
  This method is a great incentive for low-achieving students, because even with little progress theycan contribute as a result of the team.
 And middle and high school students need to help their classmates on the one hand,on the other hand, be able to maintain and improve their previous indicators.
One of the advantages of this method is that it is an opportunityIt is given to evaluate "individual students" and groups.
2. Mosaic (Jigsaw).
 Mosaic collaborative learning methodis.
 It was developed and tested at the University of Texas by Eliot Aronsonby his colleagues, then revised by Slavin և the latterby partners.
The mosaic can be used in the classroom in different ways.
  Let's present one of them.
  Students can be divided into four or fiveheterogeneous groups with members.
 Give each group a part of the lesson որոշակի some time to work.
  Groups after it expirespresent their passage, read, explain the words, go outwrites words of orthographic value, composes sentences with them, performs linguistic works, etc.
  EachA group learns one part of a lesson, but as a result they learn the wholelesson by stopping the work և listening carefully to the answers of all the groups.
  It may also have a group of experts called Jigsaw 2The stages are:• Material study և information gathering;• work in an expert group;• Work in a study group;• final work,• Summary.
3. Tours in the gallery.
  This is a variation of the "Mosaic" methodis aimed at exchanging information, developing ideas, reflecting on how to develop listening, working independently,Skills to think critically and creatively, to speak in a low voice, to present the result of work.
Groups can be used when working with younger studentsgive the same task or task.
 Upon completion of the work, students are compared with the work of the other groupsprovide communication.
4. Three keys և one lock.
 The work can be done in pairs orin a group.
  This method can be used to understand the meaning of such lessonsAt the stage, which are quite extensive, there are a number of characteristic features related to the same material or phenomenon.
Students are asked to write three sentences (three keys) that can be used to master the material from the original.Choose one sentence (lock), which will summarize, generalize what is to be said, thought, idea.
  For example: "What do you have, what is there or not, what is not?"He is an Armenian ”(Karine Torosyan և others,“ Mayreni 4, p. 62 ”).
Since the original is voluminous, we divide it into two parts և choose the possible keys և lock from each.
І Section. Keys: 1. Those who died were late.
 2. Why did they die, Dad?
 3. They were fighting.
The lock: - They fight for the homeland, they die for the homeland, they die for their honor and dignity.
 ІІ Section. The keys are: 1. - Father, let me understand, ours
What is the teacher of everything that says for the sake of the homeland?… 2. - ThisThe flourishing land on which father and son sit and miss each other, this land thatHe gives us bread.
 3. - Everything, everything you see and do not see, is a homeland,What is or is not, what is or is not, is Armenian.
Lock: -I looked at the blue-blue sky, our cliff, the mountainOn the way, on the red-red rocks of the cliff, I took my father's breath, looked at him,I felt that everything, including my father, is a homeland.
When working with this method, students develop the ability to make choices, to distinguish the main from the secondary, ashe կարող ability to cooperate, to justify his choice.
5. Five-minute free essay.
  Five-minute free essayThe method can be used both in the class promotion phase and in the reflection phase, depending on the purpose of the lesson և topic.
  We choose a topic և offer to freely express their thoughts in five minutes, from whichThen they stop working and listen to the essay written by some.
Here is an example of a collaborative learning lesson.Lesson plan - Third gradeTopic of the lesson - Soghomon Mkrtchyan "The King and the Farmer" [5,8].

 Were you surprised?
 Let's read… ".
 We give the explanationAfter reading the original, students will be familiar with it.
The second stage is meaning.
  At this stage, we select the "Explanatory Reading" և "Duplicate Diary" methods.
Students read the lesson material while explaining the familiar words, phrases և punctuation.
  After reading for the second time, we create the mentioned diary, for which the students divide the paper vertically into two parts.
 Write on the leftare the impressive parts of the original, and on the right, each is mentionedComments on the passage և Explain (What is it about?section.
 What does it remind you of?
 Why does that part work?

 OnceStudents remember և repeating that words are in compositionsimple (radical), complex և derivative.
There are three language works on page 10 that can be doneorganized by level training in cooperative groups, divided into three groups.
