Effective management of the credit market has a serious role in the development of the RA economy.
  Activity is observed in certain sectors of the economy, which in turn leads to an increase in lending.
 The management of business loans has a special place and significance in the credit market, on the basis of the analysis of which it is also possible to form an idea about the movements or trends taking place in the business sector or in the business sector.
 The analysis of business credit trends in the Armenian credit market is quite relevant in the current economic developments, so let's try to formulate some main problems in this area:  What is the share of business loans in the overall loan portfolio of commercial yards in Armenia? observed in connection with the latter during the last 7 years.
 Հաջող How successful are the credit organizations in the field of business loans provided to enterprises?
 ։ In what currency are Armenian enterprises mainly credited, and is there any foreign currency risk in the field of business lending?
 ։ Do state-owned enterprises also have business loans taken for doing business, and what is the currency structure of those loans?
  What is the sectoral distribution of business loans, and are there significant sectoral structural shifts in lending in the economy?

Commercial Bank Loans by Certain Sectors of the Economy (End of Period, Billion AMD) 4 AMD 182.3 175.4 179.4 197.7 264.0 347.1 352.0 Private 176.8 173.4 176.3 196.1 261.8 343.3 349.0 State 5.5 2 , 0 3,0 1,5 2,1 3,8 2,9 In foreign currency 808,7 1,005,6 946,6 1,013,4 1,145,5 1,187,7 1,206,4 Private 789.9 State 18.7 Non-residents In AMD 1,129,2 1,175,0 1,194,2 MANAGEMENT IN FOREIGN CURRENCY Total loans to GDP (at market prices), billion AMD Foreign currency loans62.2% (%) Share of loans in drams (%) Share of loans to enterprises (%) Share of foreign currency loans to enterprises (%) Share of loans to enterprises (%) Volume of loans provided by Armenian commercial banks to residents and non-residents 2019 As of the beginning of September 2010, they approached 3 trillion 414.7 billion drams, of which the share of residents is almost 3 trillion 168.3 billion drams, and the share of non-residents is 246.4 billion drams.
  In fact, non-resident loans make up only 7.2% of loans provided by Armenian commercial banks.
 On the other hand, in the total loan portfolio of Armenian commercial banks, foreign currency loans amount to 1 trillion 796 billion drams, and loans in drams - 1 trillion 616 billion drams, ie loans by commercial banks make almost 52%, and loans in drams - Respectively 48%.
  In fact, since 2013, foreign currency loans provided by Armenian commercial banks have been reduced by almost 10%, which means that the position of the Armenian dram has strengthened considerably.
 243 MANAGEMENT by calculating 2013-2018 in Armenia through Excel program. The correlation coefficient is 0.972, which is almost close to one, ie it turns out that there is a direct correlation between GDP and loans.
  As for the correlation or correlation coefficient between loans to enterprises and GDP, it is 0.973 and is very slightly different from the correlation coefficient of total loans and is almost equal to the latter.
 This is also evident in the diagram below.
 Total loans, billion drams GDP (at market prices), billion drams Loans to enterprises, billion drams Figure 1. Trends in GDP, total and enterprise loans in 2013-2018. (billion drams) It turns out that loans provided by Armenian commercial banks have a direct impact on GDP growth, therefore, it is predictable that the growth of lending of almost 300 billion drams in the first eight months of 2019 will contribute to GDP. almost in line with growth.
 GOVERNANCE Table 2. Loans to credit organizations by certain sectors of the economy (end of period, billion AMD) [1] To residents in AMD Foreign currency to Enterprises in AMD 60,8 53,6 54,0 55,5 62,0 94,5 Private 12,8 14.9 13.9 14.8 14.3 14.9 State 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 In foreign currency 22.0 12.8 11.9 12.8 18.9 53.3 Private 22.0 12.8 11, 9 12.8 18.9 53.3 State 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 To nonresidents 0.0 18.4 40.9 75.2 82.1 104.2 In AMD 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 In foreign currency 30 18.2 40.9 75 , 1 82,1 104,2 Total loans On the other hand, it should be noted that credit organizations, competing with a share of almost 10-11%, provided joint loans with commercial banks, and as of the end of August 2019, they had almost 385.8 portfolio up to 1 billion drams.
  The share of non-residents here is almost 104 billion drams, and the share of residents - 281 billion drams.
 By adding the credit means provided by the RA credit organizations and commercial banks, one can get a general index and thus try to get an idea of ​​the size of the RA credit market, but one fact should be noted that the RA commercial banks often finance the RA credit organizations to give loans. This means that in this case in 245 MANAGEMENT we will not be able to avoid recalculation and the figures will be approximately accurate.
 As for loans to enterprises, they amounted to 991 billion drams in 2013, which had a share of 55.1% in the total loan portfolio, and as of the end of the 8th month of 2019, it reached 45.6% or 1 This means that the proportion of business lending growth has not been maintained during the last 7 years and the volume of loans to other sectors has exceeded the volume of business lending.
 Is it possible that it contains certain risks for economic development, of course yes, because if the volume of business lending decreases, then the main "healthy" mechanism for economic growth also decreases, of course, economic growth can also be ensured by imports and consumption. Thanks to loans, however, it is unlikely to prove a healthy economy.
 Loans to enterprises by Armenian credit organizations in 2013 amounted to almost 35.5 billion drams, and in August 2019 reached 68.3 billion drams or almost 17%.
 This means that the Armenian credit organizations are not very interested in the credit market of enterprises.
  Of course, taking into account the aggressive interest rate policy pursued by credit organizations in this area, it will not be very favorable for enterprises to cooperate with credit organizations, as preference is given to commercial banks and only companies rejected by commercial banks have to cooperate with credit organizations. at the risk of financing businesses at higher interest rates.
 Foreign currency loans account for the largest share of loans provided to enterprises by Armenian commercial banks, for example, in 2014 they reached almost 85% of loans to enterprises, ie down to AMD 246. In August, the figure was 77.4%, but it is also high.
  In other words, if the share of foreign currency loans and drams in the total loan portfolio in the Armenian economy is almost the same, then we can not say the same about business loans, as their foreign exchange structure changes very slowly, which means that companies with loans 3⁄4 have a serious dependence on foreign currency, as well as this proves less confidence in their own money, as well as avoiding lending in drams.
  It is not ruled out that the volume of loans taken for import, as well as lower lending rates in terms of foreign currency loans have a special place here, but it is also a subject of serious research.
 Of course, the analysis of corporate lending needs to be carried out not only in terms of currencies, but also in terms of lending to public and private enterprises.
  However, the fact is that the volumes of crediting of state enterprises are not so big and fluctuated within the framework of 15-26 billion drams in different years and the state did not play a serious role here.
 Analyzing the AMD loans provided to residents by Armenian commercial banks by sectors, we notice that almost half of the AMD loan portfolio is consumer loans, which amount to almost 701 billion drams.
  Of course, consumer loans also create additional solvent demand for businesses, but it is very likely that these loans are not aimed at purchasing goods and services created by local products or domestic businesses, but at imported equipment, smartphones, etc.

  The volume of business loans in the total AMD loans was about 30-35%, and in recent years it was closer to 30%, and in drams in July 2019 amounted to 417 billion drams.

 The analysis of the general index of sectoral loans shows that consumer loans have almost always been in the first place, and in 2019 they exceeded the level of 811 billion drams.
 Industry had the largest volume and share of business loans - about 477 billion drams, followed by trade - 458 billion drams.
  Almost 255 billion drams were directed by the banks to the service sector, the growth rates of which have almost doubled compared to 2014.
  The service sector does not create material results, but this sector also plays an important role for the development of other sectors of the economy.
 GOVERNANCE It is noteworthy that the volume of agricultural lending, one of the largest sectors in the Armenian economy, is not so large, especially in the case of quite wide subsidy conditions, this is already a signal to understand that agricultural lending In addition to the tool, it is necessary to implement other mechanisms for the development of agriculture.

  Of course, it can also make a serious conclusion about the management of business loans by 250 GOVERNMENTS, because if shortcomings were registered in this area, such a sharp growth would not be registered.
 As a result of the studies and analyzes made in the article, we have come to a number of conclusions and conclusions: աճ The growth trends of business loans in the RA credit market are obvious, as they have grown steadily during the last 7 years.
  However, the same cannot be said about the share of business or corporate loans, as it has been reduced by almost 10% to about 45%.
  RA credit organizations have a small share in the field of corporate lending, as the latter prefer to lend to individual citizens.
 For business, the products offered by credit organizations are less competitive compared to the products offered by commercial banks.
 Վարկ Business lending in Armenia is mainly based on almost 3⁄4 of foreign currency loans, which means that the latter either have an import orientation or simply consider the interest rates on foreign currency loans to be advantageous, as being in foreign exchange risk in such a case is not so much. It would not be right.
 Բիզնես Business loans taken by state-owned enterprises in the last 7 years have not exceeded about 26 billion drams, which proves the still weak indicators of the sector.
  As for the serious sectoral or structural shifts in business lending, the picture here again hardly changes and with slight fluctuations, industry is always first, followed by trade, and third is the service sector.
