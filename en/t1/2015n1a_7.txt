The concept of "structure" was first proposed by IP. By Gerasimov [9].
 G.S. Ganeshin ինը Others understand the term "structure" as "different types of taxonomic reliefs due to the internal factors of relief - tectonic movements, structures, volcanic processes, magmatic processes, etc.", while noting that they are not "existing". your inner self, because from the moment of its emergence, they are exposed to the influence of external processes ”[5, pp. 87-88].
According to the above definition, by the structure of this work we mean not the elements of modern relief, but buried or partially exposed geological structures that form the elements of modern relief: mountain ranges, intermountain depressions, etc., the core or geological substrate.
Based on the above, it is not difficult to conclude that the discovery of such structural heterogeneities may indeed be appropriate, particularly in the search for sites that are structurally promising from minerals.
  This is evidenced by the numerous scientific works on relevant topics [6,7,10,12].
From a scientific point of view, the assessment of the latest tectonic movements as the boundaries of the development of the geological process in the deep horizons of the earth is of great interest by the approach of comparative structural analysis.
  At the same time, the discovery of the connections between the crystalline base and the structural elements of the sedimentary layer will lead to the assessment of the crystalline grounded role of the earth in the formation of the modern relief of the study area.
  Summarizing the above, let us note that the term "structure" we use, by its very definition, refers mainly to the structural elements of the sedimentary layer չէ not so applicable to the surface of the crystalline base of the earth, so we will define the latter as the element of the earth's structure.
  At the same time, we will accept that the connections revealed as a result of the research are of a structural nature.
The aim of the article is to reveal the structural connections between the "sedimentary layer" of the crystalline base of the crystalline base of the earth in the northern fold zone of Armenia.
 For this purpose, complex geophysical-geological data were used.
 The geophysical part of the data is the new gravitationally modified model of the surface of the crystalline base of the Earth of Armenia, obtained according to the values ​​of real rock densities [1], and the geological part is the morphometric analysis of the modern relief of the studied area. ].
  The choice of geophysical-geological data is conditioned by the fact that the former are the most expedient in the study of the deep structure of the earth, and the latter - the modern relief of the surface, at the same time they stand out with a high degree of comparability, which determines the complex wide application of these two directions.

Clay-height quartz monzonites, granites, granodiorites, diorites (Pambak intrusive group, Isolongers, 8. Crystal base isohypses, 9. Complex geological sections.
Thus, as a result of the above-mentioned geophysical-geological data, a complex map of the crystal base և sedimentary layer structures of the study area was obtained, supplemented by data on the distribution of intrusive bodies in the area [8], which is presented in Figure 1.
 In the article, information on the disinfection of intrusive bodies is taken from the relevant works [2,11].
In order to reveal the structural connections between the above-mentioned layers, the methods of complex structural-geological profiling were used. A total of 7 sections were made, 4 of which intersect the structural-tectonic zones by their length, and 3 by the width, which are schematically presented in Figure 2. to whom?
As can be seen from the section diagram, in the study area, there are generally direct structural links between the sedimentary layer of the earth և the crystal base structures և.
 These connections are expressed by almost complete spatial coincidences of the raised and lowered areas of the mentioned two layers.
 In areas where the surface of the crystal base is located below sea level, the values ​​of the isolonger field are ևcharacterized by low values, averaging up to 1.0-1.2 km, which is clearly expressed in both Figure 1 and Figure 2.
 At the same time, there are precincts within which inverse structural connections can be observed.
 These bonds are mainly due to the high values ​​of the isolonger field placed at relatively deep depths of the "crystalline base".
It is noteworthy that intrusive bodies of different compositions are spread in almost all sites characterized by structural inverse connections.

Roman numerals indicate the serial numbers of the sections.
In particular, on section II, which was carried out in the direction of Bavra-Amasia-Gyumri, inverse structural connections are observed in the Amasia site, which is known to be the northwestern continuation of the San-Amasia-ophiolite zone.
  Intrusive bodies are represented by peridodites, dunites and gabbro of super-basic and basic composition.
 The impact of intrusive rocks of the superstructure of the ophiolitic zone is also observed on the I-III section, which stretches in the direction of Bavra-Dilijan-Chambarak, continuing to the south-east, also includes the area of ​​the Shan mountain range.
The middle part of the Bavra-Aparan zone on section I-II և on the section VI-VI on the section Aparan-Dilijan երով the sites to the east of it stand out with their structural-inverse connections.
 In the Bavra-Aparan և Aparan-Dilijan zones, the intrusive bodies of the Pambak group, represented by oligocene-sized granitoids (in the Aparan-Dilijan zone), chalk-shaped quartz monzonites and granite B-granite (granite), played an important role in establishing structural inversions.
  As for the site east of Dilijan, it is the area of ​​intrusions forming the Berd group of the Alaverdi-Berd intrusion zone, where the intrusive bodies are represented by granitoids, quartz diorites and plagiogranites.
 On the Charentsavan-Chambarak section II-II section, the Chambarakite district stands out with similar connections, which also found its expression on the I-III section.
  On section IV-IV, which has the Tashir-Ijan-Berd stretch, in-structural inverse connections have been established within the Tashir-Ijan zone, where the intrusions forming the Alaverdi group are spread, which are comparable to the intrusions of the Berd group.
 The last VV section extends in the direction of Amasia-Alaverdi-Noyemberyan; it is distinguished by the establishment of inverse structural connections in its extreme western parts, the reason being first of all the intrusions of the superstructure of the Amasia site, in the case of the second, the middle of the Alaverdi group.
Summary. As a result of the analysis carried out by means of different structural-geological sections, it was found out that there are both direct and inverse structural connections between the structures of the crystalline base and the sedimentary layer of the earth.
Structural bonds of direct nature, in our opinion, are mainly due to tectonic processes, in particular in one case due to the folding of the corresponding layer of the sedimentary layer due to the folding of the crystal base surface, in the other case due to vertical sedimentation due to vertical displacement of individual crystal base blocks.
 The effect of deep-sea disturbances on the structure of the Earth's peripheral layers has been discussed in the work of foreign researchers [3,4,15].
  In particular, MP From the bilingual side, the so-called crease folds are separated, which are caused by the folding of the initially horizontally spreading layers, when the vertical displacement is carried out by fracture sites, or by the folding creases, which are formed by the folding joints.
None of the above-mentioned types of folding should be ruled out in order to substantiate the inter-structural connections between the two layers within the framework of our research, as the study area is distinguished by its active geodynamics, first of all by the latest tectonic, mostly block movements, and regionally and regionally.
Thus, the existence of structurally direct connections within the northern fold zone of Armenia generally indicates that the formation of a sedimentary layer in areas prominent with such connections, as well as in modern relief, is largely due to the terrestrial-crystalline surface-surface structure.
Structural inverse connections are observed mainly in the areas of propagation of intrusive bodies of different composition.
 Based on the classical geotectonic notions of the intrusive body implantation process [3], it can be generally stated that the introduction of intrusive bodies into the earth's sedimentary layer leads to its deformation and, in particular, a certain increase, which is typical of granitic batholithic intrusive bodies. Fortress in the intrusive zone.
 On the other hand, the propagation of intrusive bodies greatly affects the values ​​of the geophysical and primarily gravitational fields, causing local minima or maxima of that field due to the difference in density with the surrounding rocks of intrusive rocks, which in turn greatly affects the gravitational surface area of ​​the earth.
