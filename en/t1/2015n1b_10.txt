It is one of the priority issues of pedagogical scienceImprove the quality of education by continuously introducing the structural-content components of scientific-research-innovative activity to meet the modern requirements for the quality of education, to organize the educational-cultural process according to the age-individual peculiarities of the students.
 There have always been various difficulties in the learning process, conditioned by objective-subjective reasons.
 PresentThese are more acute in the education systemdifficulties expressed in the subject, pedagogical, methodological, psychological issues related to the ongoing process of recent educational reformswith.
  As a result of all this, the professional activity of a pedagogue becomes more complicated.
  Traditional pedagogical professionalThe difficulties are supplemented by new events, the number of which can be:classify: 1) the new assessment system, 2) collaborative teaching methods, 3) alternative textbooks, 4) increasing the problems of the upbringing process, 5) some community significanceExistence of multidisciplinary classes in schools, etc.
These phenomena determine the emergence of controversial situations and the importance of the process of guiding educators in such situations.
The purpose of this article is to identify the difficulties encountered in the implementation of the lesson process in multidisciplinary classrooms, to explain to the teacher in the process of overcoming themThe role and significance of the didactic advice given.
Considering the difficulties that arose during the professional activity of pedagogues, let us mention that back in the 1980sT. Ս. Polyakova developed provisions aimed at overcoming these difficulties.
  In that concept, he was distinguished as "didactic"The concept of "difficulty", which was understood as "felt by the teacherdifficulty in the learning process, ie the psychological state of tension, dissatisfaction with the results - the difficultyin the absence of conditions for overcoming ”[1, p. 13].
It should be added that the process of creating and developing difficulties starts from the moment of carrying out educational activitiesAt that time the teacher encounters some unexpected obstacle or contradiction.
  This process continues to develop when obstacles և contradictions are not overcome in time.
 V. K. Dyachenko distinguishes the following types of contradictions. "1) Participants in the coherent, systematic writing of the educational material by the teacher
through the incoherent, irrelevant writing of the material mastered by the student;Individual teaching in the context of classroom teachingemerging between the collective nature of nature և education ”[2, pp. 43-44].
Introducing the process of creating difficulties, let us refer to the problematic situations that arise during the implementation of the lesson process in multidisciplinary classrooms.
  Note that:Multidisciplinary are the classes where togetherThey go through a learning process for different age groupsChildren տարբեր study different subjects at the same timetopics.
  The process of teaching in multidisciplinary classroomsThe study shows that the subjects of that process - students ավար educators - when carrying out joint activitiesmeet subject, pedagogical-methodological-psychologicaldifficulties of a complex nature, interdependent, inextricably linked.
 Material difficulties usuallyare related to those պայմանավորված due to objective և subjective factorswith realities such as concepts, definitions perception, consolidation of knowledge, practical knowledge of theoretical knowledgeapplication և etc.
 Some of the material difficulties ariseDue to the lack of mastery of previous topics over time, the rest is associated with the acquisition of new ideas, the emergence of new concepts.
The material difficulty is manifested due to the overcrowding of the classroom, in particular in the multidisciplinary classrooms, it is manifested by the difficulties that arise during the transfer of different educational materials to different age groups.
These complications are due to a number of factors, including a numberOther factors can be classified as time constraints, students' focus, social-psychological adjustment of the child, insufficient form of educational motivations, incomplete establishment of discipline, etc.
 Speaking of time constraints, it should be noted that time constraint stress is the strongest that affects a child's cognition.on the implementation of the process.
  The mechanism of many basic learning skills is such that speed only hinders its development.
 In this respect, B. Bloom notes: "Teaching time should be determined according to the student's abilities.
  No student can passto the study of new material, until he has mastered the basic necessary material ”[3, p. 102].
 This idea is also emphasized by the Armenian pedagogue S. Mandinyan, noting, "it is more desirable to go less, but in such a way that
The past should be well-founded.
 Necessary place again և again explanationsto give, to make the students understand, on the condition of adding something new in their consciousness, rather than rushing և equating the result with nothing ”[4, p. 524].
  Referring to the opinions of different pedagogues:It should be noted that when organizing classes in multidisciplinary classrooms, the teaching time is limited, as a result of which The educational material is not fully understood by the child.
 This reality, which can lead not only to a decline in progress, learning,teacher, negative attitude towards school, but nervousillness, stress և depression.
Considering the importance of focusing students, it should be noted that in multidisciplinary classrooms it becomesis a factor that determines the effectiveness of the lesson, in the sense that the class is composed of representatives of different age groups, whostudy materials with different content, which in many casesIt distracts students.
 As a result, the design, organization, and implementation of the lesson become more difficultrequires a great effort from the pedagogue not only to make the right decisionThe didactic, developmental, educational goals of the class are pursued consistentlybeing their implementation, but he!provide for students of all agesFocus on the material they are studyingkeeping it from side effects.
  Accurate execution of all thisTeachers need to have flexibility and quick decisionsthe ability to make the situational thinking that is neededto say that it is not typical for all pedagogues.
Referring to the difficulties caused by the child's social-psychological adaptation, it is necessary to keep in mind that it plays a decisive role in the development of the child's low progress.
 Let's add that:This phenomenon is usually more pronounced in multidisciplinary classrooms, where it appears in the classroom.groups, tensions, and interpersonal conflicts among children.
Talking about incomplete approval of discipline is unnecessarydid not mention that in his time Ya. A. Komensky noted. "A school without discipline is the same as a mill without water" [5, p. 104].
  ContinuingThe idea is to add that in multi-faceted classroomsDiscipline is not provided to the required extent, which in itself leads to a decline in teaching efficiency.
 Discussing the controversial situations that have arisen during the pedagogical professional activity, we should mention that they condition the need to develop and test such methods and tools that help the teacher, which on the one hand will reduce the risk factors in solving pedagogical problems, on the other hand:will contribute to the creative solution of problems arising in pedagogical situations and the promotion of the teacher's innovative activity.
Today, general education, as a developing system, needs the support of professional consultants in various fields.who are authorized to carry out organizational, pedagogical,administrative, educational and other support.
 Introducing the emerging learning process in multidisciplinary classroomsdifficulties, let's talk about ways to overcome those difficultiesabout.
 Can help the teacher in such situationsto come up with a new pedagogical technology - "Pedagogical counseling".
 At present, many theoretical-practical approaches to pedagogical counseling have been developed, different models are used for all subjects of pedagogical activity.
According to M. Ն. Pzner, O. Մ. Advice from Zaichenko և Others is formulated as a special "Consultant և Consultants"
Organized complex relationship aimed at the activities of both the individual and the organization as a wholethe solution of the emerging problems, the emergence of positive changes "[4,page 9].
  Pedagogical counseling has a number of components, of which in this article we will refer only to the didactic component, which is aimed at overcoming the difficulties that arise in the teaching process.
The purpose of didactic counseling is to increase the teacher's didactic awareness, to help the teacher to overcome the difficulties encountered during his / her teaching activities.
  In the professional literature, didactic awareness is described as "teacher"the ability to solve problems that arise in the learning process in accordance with professional knowledge, skills, experience, in other words, as the ability to make connections between knowledge և situations ”[6, p. 264].
From the point of view of our research problem, they are usedespecially the conditions for the effective implementation of didactic counseling 1) Getting acquainted with the experience of advanced pedagogues; 2) developing the teacher's ability to reflect; 3) Assist the teacher in the process of developing his / her own positiondisplay.
The components of didactic advice are:1. Consultant և consultant, communication between them;2. Professional knowledge միջոց means of organizing the process of their mastery - analysis and assessment of difficult situations;3. The result of the consultation, which O. According to Alekhina, "given
is the rational combination of the knowledge and pedagogical situations of the employees of the organization ”[7, p. 74].
Didactic counseling consists of a number of stages:in each of which the pedagogical professional difficulty is presented step by step, the conditions that cause it, study of factors directly (in class) or indirectly(video) analysis of the consequences arising from it.
The background will be revealed by developing the teacher's ability to reflect.
At the last stage of the consultation, the consultant offers an individual problem-solving and problem-solving program.
 It does notis imposed on the pedagogue, but the counselor acts as a special "mirror", with the help of which the pedagogue watches his activities from the side, is able to find what he allows with his own discretion.mistakes ել organize the lesson process in a new way.
  That is, feedback is made between the pedagogical consultant և pedagogue ժ, whichHelps the pedagogue to express himself / herself.
Didactic counseling enables the pedagogue to orient himself / herself on the existing didacticin concepts, to answer the following questions independently: what?to teach և how to teach, when և what methods to use?
As a result, the pedagogue models his activity.
 As noted:is O. A. Anisimov, "modeling his own functions, is done
their abstraction, which is accompanied by their simplification.
 The realityis more diverse than theory, formulas, thus more complexfor perception.
 Simplification through models helps to orientin theoretically complex material. this is the value of modeling ”[8, pp. 137-138].
Introducing the theory of didactic counseling, it should be noted that it was piloted by our researcher.schools, including the fifth and sixth grades of Benjamin Secondary School.
  Classes were held,The directions of the teaching process were clarified, during the organization of which the support and counseling was most felt.need.
 They were separated from them especially at certain stages of the lessontime allotted, layered teaching, disciplinary tasks, including focusing on individual students.
 The lessons were followed by a didactic one with the teacherscounseling during which they were introduced to the lesson processa certain model of organization.
 According to that model, one during the lessonThe students in the class would receive a written card from the teachertask (which the teacher should have had in advance according to the lesson preparation plan / program), during which the teacher would work orally with the other grade students.
 They changed after graduationroles. The teacher would work with the first graders through oral surveys, and with the second graders through written assignments.
 As for the presentation of the new material, the teacher, at his discretion, couldTransfer new material from one class to another when assigning a card task to another class.
 To summarize,that didactic counseling helped to overcome difficult learning situations in multidisciplinary classrooms.
  Add to that the process of didactic counselingThe implementation will ensure the continuous education of pedagogues,professional development, in particular to address the problems of teaching in multidisciplinary classroomsDevelopment and introduction of new approaches, as well as their implementationcreating the necessary conditions for it.
 Didactic adviceAs a result, the teaching process will acquire a new pedagogical-psychological meaning, the difficulties existing in that process will be clarified and overcome.
  There will be professional pedagoguescreative reshaping of thinking, resulting in themThey will plan their own activities in order to organize the didactic process.
