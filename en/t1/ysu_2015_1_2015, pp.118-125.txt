In recent decades, the targeted synthesis of physiologically active chiral compounds has played an important role in the fields of biotechnology and bio-organic chemistry.
  Such compounds include non-protein α-amino acids, which are widely used in medicine, medicine, bacteriology, and other sciences.
It is known that the introduction of non-protein amino acids into the peptide chain of drugs instead of their protein analogues leads to prolongation of drug effects, due to which they are included in the composition of modern anti-tumor, analgesic and other drugs.
Only optically pure non-protein amino acids are suitable for use in almost all fields.
 Therefore, the development of effective methods for the asymmetric synthesis of enantiomerically enriched alanine, cysteine ​​and amino acid analogs of various heterocyclics of various heterocyclic radicals, including lateral radicals, is an urgent task.
 The most promising is the biomimetic asymmetric synthesis, which is the replication of biocatalytic processes in nature using simple models of biocatalysts [2].
From a technological point of view, biometric methods of asymmetric synthesis are usually available, which provide up to 90% stereoselectivity, which allows to obtain optically pure amino acid with a single recrystallization.
The literature analysis shows that the best model system for the bio-asymmetric synthesis of β-substituted optically active (S) -α-amino acids is NiII ion flat square complexes (NiII- (S) -BPB-∆-Ala և NiII- (S) -2-CBPB-∆-Ala) composed of chiral reagents based on dehydroalanine Cyclic amino acid proline based on (S) -2 [N- (N'-benzylprolyl) amino] benzophenone ((S) -BPB) և (S) - [N- (N'-2-chloro-benzylprolyl) amino] from benzophenone ((S) -2-CBPB) Schiff bases (Fig. 1) [3-6].

According to marketing data, in the field of medicine և pharmaceuticals, especially peptide antibiotics կազմում anti-tumor drugs containing non-protein α-heterocyclic substituent in the β position are of more interest.
