Preface. The collapse of the socialist system and the formation of new states made the issue of constitutions an issue
adoption in those countries.
  In this sense, the newly independent countries could notdo not take into account the world experience, but at the same time noticeablebecame the fixation of national-historical, legal-political peculiarities in the constitutions.
 The ideological and political preconditions for the adoption of constitutions are especially importantin terms of the frequency of subsequent amendments to the constitutions of those countries.
  Only in 2015-2016. Constitutional changes were made in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Estonia,
In Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
  This wayWe consider it our goal to present it especially in the framework of the articleSome of the constitutions of several countries in the post-Soviet spacesimilarities and differences խմբ group them as acceptedconstitutional models.
In the modern world, the issue of assessing constitutionality is very important, because its sustainable and mobile developmentIt is based on the supremacy of the constitution or the guarantee of constitutionality.
Armenian researchers addressed the issue to V. Baghdasaryan, G.
Harutyunyan, A. Vagharshyan, N. Ayvazyan, and from foreign researchers:
F. Giniatov, V. Blishenko, M. Solnts! Ք others.
The constitutions of the countries of the former socialist system, including Armenia, were adopted during almost the same historical period, 1992-1997, in similar political situations.
 In this regard, the initial starting point for the adoption of constitutions ևThe ideological and political significance was almost the same in these countries.
First of all, there was a transition from state law to constitutional lawthe right, which primarily presupposed state or partyExclusion of ideology for the sake of universal values.
 If:In Eastern European countries, the liberal-statist constitutional model was immediately applied [1], then in post-Soviet countries, two types of constitutional tendencies were observed [3].
 Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, one of the countries pursuing the prospect of joining the European Union in the future, created their own constitutions, pointing to the sphere of Russian influence.European transition tendencies.
 The three figures related to state building included in the preamble to the Estonian Constitution: 1918, 1938.In 1992, they were directly linked to the country's sovereigntywith its loss [5].
  The Constitution of Latvia, which was adopted in 1922. is the restored version, already shows the loss of statehood
ակն The obvious circumstance of restoration and the accusation against Russia, even in the case when that constitution with some of its provisions is simply outdated.
 Let us mention as a fact the fact that:2014 The preamble to the Latvian Constitution enshrines the provision
that. "Latvia 's identity is a European cultural area
"The creation of Latvia is the guarantee of the existence of the Latvian nation."
  SimilarGeorgia has also taken an approach by restoring the old constitution.
 The Latvian constitution is also ethnocratic, as it speaks not of Latvians but only of the Latvian nation, [7] asArticle 66 of the former Constitution of Turkey, which covers all of Turkeyconsiders the citizens Turks.
  There is a similar approach. "Preface to the Lithuanian Constitution [9].
 In the constitutions of these countries, non-citizens have too many privilegesthat “everyone has property / Lat. border h.105 /, freedom of information / religious / Lit. border հհ. 7, 25, 26 /, to hold positions in state-local self-government bodies / Est.
border, h. 11 / right ».
Article 122 of the Estonian Constitution states: “The land border of Estonia was established in 1920. Tartu Peace Treaty
երով by other international agreements on borders ", is not unambiguousis perceived by neighboring countries, particularly Russia, as "the USSRWith Estonia joining, Tartu lost the agreementits legal force, and in 1991 Estonia did not leave the USSR
In no way does it mean the restoration of the Tartu Treaty.
 Estonia:Recognition of independence in 1991 September 6 is just based on it
on the fact that Soviet Estonia was a part of the USSR. "
 {16}This provision also raises border disputes, which is why in 1993 On July 12, 1994, the presidency of the Supreme Council of the Russian Federation proposed to cancel the Tartu Agreement, on the basis of which the 1994
On June 21, Russia unilaterally delimited the Russian-Estonian border {17}.
The second group of countries are the states that:are in closer military-economic-political cooperationWith Russia [4].
 They also joined the Eurasian Economic Unionare the countries.
 In the case of these countries, they are immediately historicalproblems of restoration of justice, under legal procedurestrends of hidden territorial claims.
 In particular, written in the preamble to the Constitution of KazakhstanThe Kazakh nation established its statehood on the original or indigenous Kazakh lands.
 It is debatable here in Zelinograd or Astana,The question of the affiliation of Pavlodar, Semipalatinsky, Yaik or Gur from the historical point of view.
  In addition to universal valuesinclusion: freedom, equality, brotherhood, KazakhstanThere is an element of national ideology in the constitution.
 In particular, in Article 2, one of the bases of the state's activityIt is called "Kazakh patriotism".
 Unlike Russia, which:Article 13 of the Constitution prohibits the creation of a state ideology, Article 5 of the Constitution of Kazakhstan provides an opportunity for the formation of such an ideology:as needed.
  In contrast to the Baltic states, Kazakhstan's constitution prohibits parties and trade unions from being funded from foreign sources, and the appointment of heads of foreign religious organizations is agreed upon.with state bodies / Articles 5,9 /.
The Constitution of Belarus also has a controversial historyquestions.
  In particular, the preface states that the basis of universal values ​​և self-determination is based on the Belarusian centuries-oldis statehood [12].
  The validity of this provision is zero because:The territory of Belarus was either of Russia, or of Poland, orAs part of Lithuania.
 There is a similar wording in the preamble to the Constitution of Ukraine, which is somewhat understandable, but here tooThere is an expression "Ukrainian land".
 This constitutional provision is more political, which justifies having a state independent of Russia on the one hand (in favor ofThis fact is evidenced by Article 18 of the Constitution, which states:Military neutrality of Belarus), on the other hand, the prevention of Polish-Lithuanian claims.
  The main constitutional goal of this idea is to ensure the rights and freedoms of every citizen of Belarus.
 It is forbidden to have a mandatory state ideology here, but legal bases are creatednot necessarily to have it.
  Following the example of Kazakhstan,Belarus "distinguishes between religious organizations":separating them from their own և foreigner. Article 16
It is more than political and extreme in the Constitution of AzerbaijanThe provision in the preamble, according to which, in line with the unsubstantiated thesis of centuries-old Azerbaijani statehood, in the Azerbaijani nationThe citizens living in the territory of Azerbaijan enteroutside the territories that can be considered as Azerbaijaniterritories [14].
  It is noteworthy that no Central AsianThe state does not refer to its centuries-old in its constitutionstatehood.
  In this respect, the Moldovan constitution is unique, which indirectly enshrines the idea of ​​having the same statehood with the Romanians.
  The preamble to the Constitution takes into account:The fact that the Moldovan nation has an uninterrupted statehood in historical and ethnic territories is taken into account.
Conclusion. Thus, we can prove that a post-Soviet one
They had the constitutions of a number of countries at the time of their adoptionthe following commonalities.1. Preface to the Constitutions “Centuries-old statehoodThe fact of having sovereignty, territorial issues or conflicts, in particular Belarus, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Ukraine,Azerbaijan.
2. There are two groups of countries whose constitutions are indicative of their geopolitical orientation.

4. The Liberal-Statistical basis is present in all constitutions.
5. The frequency of constitutional amendments indicates the existence of problems with the monitoring of constitutionalityin the field of management.
