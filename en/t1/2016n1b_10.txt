1. Introduction.
 Solving a number of mathematical, physical, technical, and other problems requires calculating the values ​​of elementary functions for different values ​​of the variable.
  That:and because of that, they were created in the Middle AgesTables of values ​​of functions, as well as formulas for approximate calculation of values ​​of some functions.
 And later widely usedreceived the theory of series, chain fractions, etc., to whichelementary functions were represented by ներկայաց were determined by themvalues ​​[1-4].
 Ahead of the development of the latest technologiesDuring the years, computer mathematics kits were created by relevant specialists, which are a powerful tool for various purposesfor solving mathematical problems, in particular, for calculating the values ​​of elementary functions.
 Similar packages are MAPLE,MATHEMATICA, MATLAB, MACSYMA և other computer packages.
In particular, the MAPLE package for various mathematical problemsIt is a powerful and flexible tool for solution.
 Package over 2000 commandsgive an opportunityto solve algebra, mathematicalanalysis, differential equations և a number of other mathematicalsphere problems, in particular, to calculate elementary functionsvalues ​​for different values ​​of the variable [5, 6].
The first part of this work presents the analytical methods for calculating the values ​​of trigonometric functions in series ևthrough chain fractions, and are presented in the second partSome features of the MAPLE computer package, with which you can calculate the values ​​of trigonometric functions, perform interpolation, construct graphs of functions, etc. with the desired accuracy on a personal computer.
2. Calculation of the values ​​of trigonometric functions in rowsմիջոցով by means of chain fractions.
2.1. Calculation of sine և cosine values.
 We use to calculate the values ​​of functions և:from the fact of the analysis of the rank series [1-4]..
                            (2)(1) Rows և (2) slowly converge at large values ​​of x;  functions:but given the fact that:are periodic functions և taking into account the formulas բեր canWe conclude that it is sufficient to be able to calculate these functions  in the range.
  In addition, the following can be used:values:  և:from recurrent formulas.where:through. The sums are determined by the following relations.
          (4)Similarlywhere:through. The sums are determined by the following relationsSince.
             (6) in range (1) for a monotonically decreasing residual member nRis a sequence of signs with checkers, then hisThe following assessment takes place [1]..
                                       (7)The same is true for the residual member of series (2)The following rating:.
                                            (8) That's why The process of calculating the values ​​of the functions can be stopped if the next received member is hiswill be absolutely smaller than the permissible error։.

Thus:Example 4. count to:510 շտ accuracy..
 radian radio.
Using (4), we will have:.
Thus:The cosine of any angle can be calculated in the same way.
2.2. Calculation of tangent և cotangent values.
It is advisable to determine the value of the tangent for chain fractionsthrough [2].
 Accepting:Based on Lambert's formula [2] we will have:.

Thus:.
Having the tangent of an angle, you can easily determine that angleKotangens.
3. Calculation of the values ​​of trigonometric functions using the computer MAPLE package.
 In a computer MAPLE package, the value of a trigonometric function can be determined using the evalf (f, n) array, and n is the decimal point, where f is the function to be calculated, for example:The number of digits stored after the comma of the Nordic fraction.
With this command you can instantly get the answers to the examples above for any value of argument x:with the desired accuracy [6].
Example 1. to count
  the value of the function10  accuracyin.
Example 2. count the value of the functionin.
In each example discussed, the answer (value of the function) is received in seconds, և it is easy to make sure that it matchesanalytically calculated value.
