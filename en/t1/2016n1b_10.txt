1. Introduction.
 Solving a number of mathematical, physical, technical, and other problems requires calculating the values ​​of elementary functions for different values ​​of the variable.
  Because of this, tables of values ​​of trigonometric functions were created in the Middle Ages, as well as formulas for the approximate calculation of the values ​​of some functions.
 Later, series theory, chain fractions, etc., through which elementary functions were represented and their values ​​were determined, were widely used. [1-4]
 In anticipation of the development of the latest technologies, computer mathematics kits have been created by specialists in recent years, which are a powerful tool for solving various mathematical problems, in particular, for calculating the values ​​of elementary functions.
 Similar packages are MAPLE, MATHEMATICA, MATLAB, MACSYMA և other computer packages.
In particular, the MAPLE package is a powerful and flexible tool for solving various mathematical problems.
 More than 2000 packet commands make it possible to solve problems in algebra, mathematical analysis, differential equations, and a number of other mathematical areas, in particular, to calculate the values ​​of elementary functions at different values ​​of a variable [5, 6].
The first part of this work presents the analytical methods for calculating the values ​​of trigonometric functions by means of "chain fractions", and the second part presents some features of the MAPLE computer package, which can be used to calculate the values ​​of trigonometric functions, interpolation, etc.
2. Calculate the values ​​of trigonometric functions using series-chain fractions.
2.1. Calculation of sine և cosine values.
 To calculate the values ​​of the functions, we use the fact that they are analyzed in degrees of order [1-4].
                            (2) (1) The series և (2) slowly converge at large values ​​of x, but the functions, given the fact that they are periodic functions և taking into account the formulas, we can conclude that it is sufficient to be able to calculate between these functions.
  Moreover, the following values ​​can be used as "recurrent formulas". The sums are determined by the following relations.
          (4) Similarly. The sums to be determined are determined by the following relationships:
             In range (6), series (1) is a sequence of nR residual members with monotonic decreasing modulus, followed by the following evaluation [1].
                                       (7) Similarly for the residual member of series (2) the following assessment takes place.
                                            (8) Therefore, the process of calculating the values ​​of the functions can be stopped if the next obtained member is absolutely smaller than the permissible error։.

Using (4), we will have.
Thus, the cosine of any angle can be calculated equally.
2.2. Calculation of tangent և cotangent values.
It is expedient to determine the value of the tangent by means of chain fractions.
 Based on Lambert's formula [2], we will have:

Having the tangent of the angle, it is easy to determine that inorganic tangent.
3. Calculation of the values ​​of trigonometric functions using the computer MAPLE package.
 In a computer MAPLE package, the value of a trigonometric function can be determined using the evalf (f, n) array, and n is the decimal point, where f is the function to be calculated, such as the number of digits stored after a comma.
With this command, for the arbitrary value of the x argument, it is possible to instantly get the answers of the above examples with the desired accuracy [6].
Example 1. calculate the value of the function to the nearest 10։.
Example 2. calculate the value of a function in.
In each example discussed, the answer (function value) is obtained in seconds, և it is easy to make sure that it matches the value calculated analytically.
