Introduction.
 The northern fold region of the Republic of Armenia occupies the entire northern part of the territory of the republic, bordering the central volcanic region from the south.
 As a typical corrugated area, it has undergone highly differentiated intensive tectonic ups and downs during the modern geological phase, which is clearly reflected in its modern complex block structure.
 Of particular importance among the studies carried out in this direction is the study of the structure of the earth's sedimentary layer as the highest, most dynamic layer of the earth.
  Deviating from the traditional geological-geophysical methods, we have attempted to apply modern tectonic geological methods in previous works, which are mostly based on the analysis of the modern relief and its individual elements, directed to the study of the structure of the earth's highest horizons.
 The results obtained within the framework of the mentioned works, by allowing them to continue and gradually deepen the work carried out in this direction by their reasonable nature and reliability.
Research methodology.
 As in our previous work, in this case, this study was conducted by analyzing the quantitative values ​​of the river network of the study area.
  Guided by the well-known Horton-Strachler classification [1], we have singled out the 2nd և 3rd class river flows of the study area.
  Our previous work is devoted to the analysis of 2nd order streams [2,3], in the framework of which the initial assumption that the isolonger field composed of 2nd order river flows characterizes the structure of the highest horizons of the interstitial layer.
  The main purpose of the work is to study the structure of the deeper horizons of the sedimentary layer, as in the theory of geological interpretation of the iso-longer method, according to which, as the river flow rate increases, the depth of the study layer also increases, the main emphasis in this article is on the third river. , which allow exploring the deeper horizons of the sediment layer, which will directly border the surface of the crystalline base.
 The latter assertion was substantiated in Emer's previous work [4], when analyzing the Vayk-Syunik region և the same approach was applied.
The main results of the research.
 The following Figure 1 shows the gravitational model characterizing the structure of the crystalline substructure within the study area [5, 6].
 The 0's isohyps characterizing the surface of the sea is defined as the boundary between the "raised" structures of the model, on which the surface of the crystalline base has the raised - up zones or individual structures, characterized by positive or negative values.
At the same time, in Figure 1 you can see the sequence of raised and lowered zones, which mostly have a general Caucasian extension.
 The first of them is the Shirak intermountain concave area, where the crystalline base is located at a depth of 4 km from the sea level.
 To the east, from the north-west of the territory of the republic to the Arzakan exposure area, there is a zone of rising of the crystalline base, where the base rises by 1-2 km compared to the sea level.
 This zone in the Spitak section is interrupted by the structure of the same name -1 - -1.5 km, which connects the homonymous zone stretching in the direction of Shirak և Bavra-Vanadzor-Dilijan-Chambarak.
 From here to the east, the ascent of TashirIjan stretches in a parallel direction, which ends from the east with the descent of Noyemberyan-Berd.
 In addition to the general Caucasian direction, some structures of anti-Caucasian tension are observed, from which the structures of Gyumri-Spitak-Vanadzor stretch, Artik-Vanadzor-Dilijan stretch և Hrazdan-Dilijan-Berd stretch are clearly expressed.
  Such a complex mosaic image testifies to the complex geological-tectonic history of the folded region under study.
Figure 1. Gravitational model of the surface of the crystalline base of the earth in the northern fold region of the Republic of Armenia Referring to the structural model of the sediment layer, let us mention that the deeper horizons, which directly border the surface of the crystalline base.
Based on the proposed sediment layer structure model (Figure 2), the field values ​​range from 3 to 16 km.
It should be reminded that according to the applied isolonger method, low field values ​​characterize decreasing and high values ​​characterize elevated structures.
 In the proposed model, the 6 km long isolong is chosen as the separation boundary of these structures.
Guided by the same sequence of structure analysis, it should be noted that in the structural model of the sediment layer, a similar shift of the descending-elevated structural zones is clearly observed, as was the case with the crystal base.
 At the same time, it should be pointed out that there are certain correspondences in the stretch of the boundaries of the zones, which, of course, should have been considered.
Figure 2. The model of the structure of the sedimentary layer of the earth in the northern fold region of the Republic of Armenia according to the data of the 3rd order isolongers field. Thus, in the extreme west the Shirak lowering is clearly distinguished, which, together with the lowering of Spitak, is included in Amasia to Chambarak. From that point of view it corresponds to the Saint-Shirak geosynclinal.
  At the same time, this vast zone is interrupted in some places by some elevations, which are in fact the result of the Artik-Vanadzor-Dilijan structure of the anti-Caucasian tension observed in the crystal base.
  As in the surface model of the crystal base, here this structure joins the Tashir-Ij-elevation from the east.
The proposed model of sediment layer structure lacks the raised zone of Amasia-Vanadzor, which is clearly expressed on the surface of the crystalline base.
 This fact should not be explained by the fact that the model of the surface of the crystal base is a gravitational model based on the recalculation of the local gravitational field, which is known to be greatly influenced by the rock density values.
In the mentioned Amasia site, which is the continuation of the north-western ophiolite zone of Saint-Amasia, the rocks of widespread superstructure formed an excess density when calculating the gravitational field, which led to an artificial elevation of the crystalline base. It is shown in the model.
  This is evidenced by some studies conducted by other authors for the site [7], according to which the surface of the crystalline base is located at a depth of 4-5 km from the seawater.
  The same can be said for the San ophiolite site.
From the other structural zones, the structural model of the Noyemberyan-Berd zone layer is more clearly expressed in the Berd site, and as for the Noyemberyan site, the effect of Lalvar intrusions is observed here, due to which the field values ​​here are up to 16 km.
  And finally, the lowered zone - Hrazdan-Dilijan-Berd - with a maximum value of up to 5 km.
Conclusion.
  Summing up the above comparative analysis, it should be concluded that the structural feature of the deeper horizons of the sedimentary layer within the northern fold region of the Republic of Armenia is mostly inherited from the crystalline base.
 The main faults on the surface of the latter, in the form of separate structural-tectonic zones and units, have affected the structure of the deep horizons of the sedimentary layer above, giving it a comparable structure.
  In all this, the role and significance of the process of introducing intrusive bodies should not be overlooked, as they have played a crucial role in the formation of individual structures at the local level.
