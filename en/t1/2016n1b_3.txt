The multi-genre work of well-known writer Gurgen Khanjyan has long attracted the attention of modern Armenian literary critics.
S. Sarinian [14, pp. 308-318], D. Gasparyan [4, pp. 365-376], Z. Avetisyan [3, p. 191-202], Ժ. Kalantaryan [16, pp. 137-160], A. Avanesyan [2], S. Margaryan [12, pp. 180-189, 207-218], H. Saribekyan [13, pp. 322-327], S. Abrahamyan [1 ] և others.
 In the republican scientific-literary press [7,8,9,10] we published several articles about the writer's plays.
In this article we have focused our attention on G. In some of the works of Khanjyan's new collection of plays [6], the author's unique artistic approaches to reviving the problems of national life in the artistic system of plays.
 In plays with modern themes, the playwright has come closer to the realistic principles of depicting reality.
And the existential and psychoanalytic ways of creating characters in some plays reveal the unique aspects of the character of the actors.
 In addition, plays with a modern theme are rich in vital content, new and complex human relationships, the characters are often embodied as typical characters, who are individualized by their psychology, life experience, destinies, linguistic and stylistic features of speech.
 In describing the real people with their words, G. Khanjyan's high mastery proves that he studied the prototypes of his heroes well.
 If some of them are not typical, then the author has been able to see characteristic features in the character of people in this social status - actions that have made them real and convincing, "possible" and "probable", as, according to Aristotle, should be the literary image. in general [4, pp. 163-164].
Of course, there are certain connections between the writer's fiction "plays".
  Literary critic Z. Avetisyan, for example, describing the main peculiarity of the writer's prose, writes: "The bureaucratic apparatus that governs the modern world brings nothing to man except the lawless reality, which in no way obeys the logic of reason.
 This is the vital but not cheerful reality of the works of the well-known prose writer Gurgen Khanjyan, which has been reflected in almost all of his works ¦ ¦ [3, p. 191].
  Let us often meet the depiction of such a reality typical of a writer's prose in the artistic environment of his plays.
  However, in some plays the author injects an optimistic, life-giving current.
  In order to face the difficulties of life, there are characters who have a tendency to live a traditional and normal human life.
 Therefore, G. Life is more colorful in the artistic sphere of Khanjyan's plays.
  By not pinning his hopes on state initiatives, the author shows that in the face of the harsh realities of life, at least some individuals try to care for others, and one of the young people transforms under the influence of a feeling of love.
From the point of view of the above-mentioned ideas, let us consider the plays "The Orphan Family", "This House Was a Different House", "The Dance of the Insane", "The Georgian Poetry".
 Let's start with the first.
  The playwright, with his uniqueness, referring to the phenomena of social polarization that are not characteristic for the new times, often depicts in his plays the people who appear at the lower level of the society and maintain their existence by begging.
 Such are almost all the characters in the play "The Orphans Family", except for Harut, and the common denominator for all of them is that at the moment, regardless of age, they are orphans.
 According to the playwright, at Harut's request, beggars Ohan, Knar, eighty-year-old Iskuhi living alone, prostitute Astghik, and finally little Norik gather at his house.
 Harut clarifies the unusualness of the situation.
 He is a builder, he earns well, but he does not have a family և by his inner demand, at the dictation of his soul, he wants to have a new family in his house with all the members of the Armenian, traditional family (father, mother, grandmother, wife, child).
 The playwright underlined the genre peculiarity of the play with a subtitle that it is a "dramatic comedy".
 The comedy here is that people who have had different destinies in the past, due to their age and circumstances, find themselves under the same roof only at Harut's wish, which, despite the unusualness, eventually becomes desirable for them as well.
 However, they had differences, Ohan even supposes that he is of gypsy origin.
  The lyre was an opera singer, Astghik was engaged in prostitution, being trafficked by a man she liked.
 Iskuhi was a teacher, she was married twice, but now she is single.
 The coexistence experience of people with such a past, their personal, everyday, habitual preferences can not but give rise to jokes, humor, irony.
 In the play, the author presented the satire with the characters' speech, dialogue, and everyday nudity.
As the play is constructed according to G. Khanjyan, as he is in the situation typical of the situation typical of modern dramaturgy in general, the drama is expressed in it through dialogues saturated with characters.
 The stories of the above-mentioned actors reveal the dramatic consequences of the lives of orphans and deprived relatives.
  Besides, through their destinies, the catastrophic consequences of the modern reality, the collapse of the economy of the early period of independence in Armenia in the destinies of gifted people become visible.
 It is mainly during those difficult years for our country that the above-mentioned people deviate from their more or less normal way of life, appear at the bottom of life, become beggars, prostitutes, homeless.
 What? The author, due to the preferences of his existential worldview, brings everyone to a unique borderline situation in this period of their life, during which he reveals a number of aspects of their essence.
The dramatic is intertwined with the comedy from the moment Harut informs them of his intention.
  People based on national traditions, normal family life, hypothetically, hypothetically consider the offer acceptable, try to enter their roles.
 Of course, man strives to create stability in his life, to achieve a certain relative harmony.
 Harut is trying to create such harmony.
 There is no obvious dramatic clash between the characters.
 But it is not easy to accept the offer at once, because each of them, however, has gone through different ways in his life.
  The lives of Knar and Ohan's beggars have even evoked a unique sense of individual freedom; they even think that family responsibilities can limit their former freedom.
And Astghik, considering her hard past experience, kindly thinks that she will not have a child, she will make Harut unhappy, she wants to refuse the offer to marry him.
 Iskuhi is the oldest և In the role offered by Harut, she tries to take care of everyone with the behavior typical of a grandmother of a family with strong character traits.
  What? The author gradually arouses sympathy for all the main characters.
 Such an attempt at unification, at least, seems unstable, which keeps the dramatic tension until the end.
 It still seems that some motive, some reason can easily undermine their conditional unity.
 Here it is worth reminding L-Z. The following observation with Surmelyan. "And in the clash of opposing forces we often achieve a more dramatic result, when the reader's sympathy is almost equally distributed between the conflicting parties," they are treated almost equally.
 The reader is also not sure whether he will support the theme, "both sides claim his sympathy" [15, p. 153].
  In this play, of course, there are no conflicting parties, each of them, by making self-determination, can be involved in relatively harmonious relations.
 It's just that the dilemma of compatibility or incompatibility of some of their characters maintains dramatic tension during the play.
In the artistic environment created by the intertwining of drama and comedy, the realization of Harut's dream to create a family with a horse depicted in the play ends with the episode of the ceremony celebrating the little, orphaned New Year.
 Such a solution to the proposed topic is an expression of the author's good wish.
 The playwright tries to prove that a family is not created only by biological, blood ties.
 The centuries-old tradition of having a family to withstand life's trials and tribulations and the inner need to be in the bonds typical of family members are an exceptional value for an individual, especially an Armenian.
 The post-complication must be maintained even in the version depicted in the play, or we must accept the obvious fact that the "family" presented in the play, of course, has preconditions for internal instability.
However, preconditions for instability can also be found in normal families.
 In either case, it is simply necessary for all the members of the family to make a personal effort to maintain a close relationship with their relatives.
G. Khanjyan reveals the complexities of human relations and the psychological complexes of individuals in our reality by using theatrical and literary tricks, especially by artistically dismantling and presenting the knots of the intertwined relations of ordinary family members.
 In the environment caused by the state-social order, economic difficulties and the collapse of the relative stability of the former national status established during the years of independence in the republic, new noticeable changes are taking place in Armenian families.
 In particular, the number of people going abroad for work (or forever) is increasing, and new versions of the destinies of Armenian family members are emerging, as well as new literary types.
 From this point of view, the play "Estan was a different house" is remarkable.
  Using the central image of Hayk's subconscious, using the memory, fantasy, and mythical elements, the fate of the Armenian family members of the period of independence is presented here, with the author's ingenuity and imagery of constructing a dramatic speech.
  Capacious dialogues with the ghosts of Hayk and his dead relatives reveal their past, the essence of human relations, the moral-psychological description, the emotional-emotional, instinctive, unconscious conscious perceptions of blood relatives.
  In all of this there is a combination of manifestations of evil in the family, in which the role of psychoanalytic cognition occupies a significant place in the writer's discoveries.
  The notions of the psychological complexities discussed in the theory of psychoanalysis [8, pp. 240-276] were expressed in a unique way when presenting the tendencies of his mother and sister's sexual love for Hayk during adolescence.
 Such deviations from the traditional values ​​and stereotypes of national morality appear in the field of memories awakened by the subconscious of the main character, through the confessions of his relatives.
His parents, grandparents, sister, uncle died due to the difficult economic conditions in the country during the years of independence, and some (sister, uncle) due to mental disorders.
Hayk appeared in the USA, tried to help his relatives left in Armenia, but the small help was not significant.
The ghost-characters of the relatives born from his memory, presenting themselves with their good and bad sides, accuse him of leaving them, not fully helping them.
 Hayk tries to justify himself, emphasizing that they were not saints either.
 But his American wife calls from the United States, and it turns out from their conversation that Hayk has money in the bank, which only he can use.
 And he came to Armenia to sell his father's house, ostensibly to pay off debts.
  Haykijlat, which in its turn, during the first years of independence, causes the destruction of its relatives in the cold and cold at the same time, causes a moral and psychological crisis in its inner world.
  The symbolic presence of a human being makes one think about the instinctive, animalistic, selfish prejudice of Hayk.
  The notion of self-contradiction is contrasted with the feelings of caring for the family, not fulfilling the moral duty to the family, strengthened by social experience and national traditions.
According to the author's idea, not being able to cope with these contradictory feelings and not finding a way to get rid of the illusions, all this pushes him to commit suicide.
Գ. In his works, Khanjyan prefers not to create characters with unbroken merits and defects.
  In the realm of his worldview and aesthetics, in theatrical works, including this play, people, individuals appear as artistic figures shaped by their life experience, who have a unique idea of ​​their shortcomings and merits, as well as their truth about life and their relationship with it.
  The Armenians who justify their lives in a different way, Hayk, who appeared in the United States and tasted the contradictions of freedom and deprivation, in his turn justifies himself as someone who demands world recognition, self-affirmation and self-establishment to the best of his ability.
  However, the pursuit of self-justification does not save Hayk from destruction, because it was necessary to take into account the truth of others (in this play, relatives), to have a sense of responsibility for the fate of their own.
 And the voluntary or involuntary neglect of blood relations cannot but cause a moral-psychological crisis in the soul of an Armenian, an individual who grew up in the environment of traditional family ties, in general.
 Maybe the prototype that mastered the Armenian, supposedly American pragmatic thinking would not have committed suicide like him.
 It seems that the playwright simply punished him by interfering in the play's idea, because Hayk's excuses for not supporting his relatives seem unconvincing to the author. After all, Hayk, nevertheless, has time to come to Armenia to sell the find.
 But anyway, in our opinion, Hayk's suicide proves his advantages over other members of the family.
  In their destruction is Hayk's sense of personal moral responsibility, ultimately, subconsciously pushing him to take that step.
The burden of guilt in the death of his family members does not weigh only on Hayk, because, as it turns out, his father and mother were selfish people.
 They connected the solution of the problem of getting the family out of a difficult situation only with Hayk.
 Whereas, for example, the father, who had fun with different women in hotels, could very well, if he wished, think about the family worries of those years and find a way out of the difficult situation.
 In these other plays by G. Khanjyan, the complexities of human relations are often discussed and artistically depicted in the range of psychological dilemmas between individual freedom and responsibility.
  By revealing the flaws and merits of his characters and showing them at the level of psychoanalytic observations, the playwright in any case continues to present his attitude towards them from the point of view of national and universally acceptable standards of morality.
In the drama "Dance of the Insane" the complexity of family members' relationships is manifested in relation to social and moral issues of different proportions.
 During the years of independence, the father of the family, Smbat, provided a prosperous life for the family due to his abilities, initiative and business.
 However, he is not as perfect as his peers, he was often entertained, he had mistresses.
 And when things failed, he reached the door of despair, with his letter he tried not only to share the property of his cousins, Karine and Karen, but also the son, Arsen, born in Tbilissi (Georgia), of an immoral woman.
 But the ungrateful children (Karine and Karen) do not try to support Smbat, who is in a state of mental depression, after their father tries unsuccessfully to commit suicide out of desperation.
  On the contrary, in order to seize the money and property left to them by letter, a sister and brother do everything they can to "bring his father to the door of death prematurely" or even kill him by throwing him cold-heartedly from the bridge.
  Karine and Karen, who live on their father's business, have become selfish, selfish, lazy, and incapable of doing anything.
 It becomes a major task for them to regulate their content life with paternal money.
 Such an attitude makes them, along with some mental fluctuations, accountable criminals-patriarchs.
G. Khanjyan tries to connect the perspective of modern youth with the traditions and moral values ​​of civilization formed in the national and universal culture.
 He presents this vision through the use of both dramatic and comedic literary tricks expressed in his plays.
  In this respect, the comedy "Kyartuakanpoem" was created with a unique Gurgenkhanjyan idea.
  Gagik, the son of the owner of a large supermarket, is a typical bearer of Kyrgyz culture in Armenia. His friend under the influence, Sisak.
 The author presents them with a Kyrgyz vocabulary, way of thinking, behavior.
  Their behavior is ridiculed by the neighbor's daughter Mane, with whom Gagik is in love.
 The latter seems to be a developed boy, national, traditional, but thanks to his father's means he avoids serving in the army, because of which he is ridiculed and ridiculed by Maneikogh.
  The source of the satirical criticism is the display of a number of aspects typical of boys with orthodox ideas, such as the display of thinking, way of life, and their lack of seriousness, concern only with personal well-being and interests, such as Gago's supposedly national, traditional interests. .
 Mane once again mocks the inconsistency of his ideas with the real nationalism, in particular patriotism, by serving the homeland in the army.
 Kyartu Gago's arrogance, thus, to have the opportunity to live well thanks to his father, to get rid of bribery through acquaintances from the army. § GAGO- I would come… But the carpet would have to be eaten, wouldn't it? a, gidas¦ [6, p. 350].
 Meanwhile, Kyartu Siso, whose father does not have such opportunities, is ready to do "low-class" work for them in case he is released from the army with the help of Gago's father.
 What? The insightful observation of the author reveals the bankruptcy of the ostentatious behavior of the Kyrgyz, which, however, differs from the others in some outward appearance, the frivolity and conditionality of all that.
    The basis of such behavior and thinking, however, are the boys of more or less knowledgeable people and some friends associated with them in terms of age, self-defense logic and instincts, artistic taste preferences. They listen to rabbis' music, speak in slang, wear clothes, have a general idea of ​​everyday life, and so on.
  Such connections and circumstances, like everything in life, change over time and due to circumstances.
This is the factor of love feeling that plays a role on Gago's Kyrgyz behavior.
 He fell in love with Mane and traveled for a year to avoid serving in the army in the East, but he still could not forget the girl.
  In some circumstances, he has even defended Mane in the past.
  The feelings towards the girl left a deep imprint in Gagik's soul.
 Mane's ridiculous criticism of Gago and his friend's Kyrgyz behavior ultimately has a positive effect on Gago.
 He is gradually changing his behavior, trying to give up the Kyrgyz slang little by little.
 In order to gain Mane's sympathy, they even take care of Mane's friend Aramitatik with Sisak, take him food.
 More. In order to be worthy of Mane, Gago decides to go to the army anyway.
 "GAGOHA, I am not automatically, voluntarily."
 "I will go and stand at the border so that you can enter a quiet university and study," [6, p. 401], he says to Mane.
In real life, the relationship between Gago and Mane's boys and girls may have been different.
But և so we can not deprive the author of the right to orient his young heroes in life through artistic means.
Especially since the Kyrgyz type is found mainly among young people, and they often show unstable tendencies due to their age, they are quickly attracted to the unusual, they like to be different from others in appearance, as soon as they give up some preferences in the past.
  In such a moral context, the feeling of true, spontaneous love can play a transformative role.
 Even taking this circumstance into account, the playwright gave Gagik the opportunity to transform into a field of love in the artistic reality created by him.
 Therefore, the comedy is titled "Kyrgyz Poem", where the role of the feeling of love in the transformation of young Gagik's thinking was used.
 Because, if the play belonging to the comedy genre is a "poem", then the role and significance of lyricism and the feeling of love have been pushed to the forefront in the realm of Gago's inner orientations towards Mane.
Thus, G. The above-mentioned plays of Khanjyan reflected the sides of the complex human relations of the period with gloomy and bright oases.
  In the artistic system of depicting life, some expressions of realistic, existentialist, psychoanalytic principles have been combined with the expressions of the playwright's humanitarian, nationally beneficial attitude towards the reform of life and the individual.
