The "capital" category in sociology in recent yearsIt is widely used, often talking about reputation, trust, legal և other capitals.
The basic properties of capital have been substantiated by the German thinker Karl Marx, [2] but the meaning of the latter has expanded in modern sociology.
 Today's Russian sociologist V. V. Rada, based on the political-economic interpretation of capital,
emphasizes its social essence.
  According to him, it "may not accept"Only materialized, but incorporated forms, that is, they are embodied in the relations between individuals and people",expand the range of horses to be analyzed [6, p. 22].
 Note that the Russian sociologistThe approach is based on how P. Bourdieu, as well as J. On Kulman's views.
 Our focus is on corporate reputationin the context of the content of symbolic and social capital.
  Accordingly, it is logical to briefly present those eggs first.
In fact, there is still not enough attention in sociologyallocated to the study of meso-level social and symbolic capitals - individual enterprises, firms, companies - corporations.
The term "social capital" was first coined by the American sociologist Glenn Lowry.
  However, one of the most famous concepts of social capital belongs to James Culman, according to which:Social capital Mutual trust և Mutual assistance potentialin purposefully formed interpersonal relationships. Liabilities և Expectations, sources of information
և social norms [7,9].
  According to Culman, social capital is a set of relationships, the parent of actions, and thatThe relationship is based on the expectation that agentsThey will fulfill their obligations without sanctions [8], and at the same time the concentration of expectations և obligations is manifested in the generalized notion of "trust".
 It turns out that the more responsibilities are accumulated in a given community, the more vividly expressed by bothor mutual "faith" is therefore highly socialthe level of capital [12, p. 66].
  In this case, social capitalobserved at the micro level, particularly the interaction of humansin the context of trust և purposeful actions.
However, it is also possible to offer a wider range of social capitala definition in which the person is not the only one in the role of a social actor.
  It is more acceptable in one of the famous Russian sociological magazinesproposed definition. "Social capital is social by an individual, organization, social group or the whole society
is the conscious use of networks that, thanks to trust, are commonnorms and rules, it becomes a means to an end ”[3, p. 33].
In such a definition, social networks are spectacular, which are one of the basic components of social capital.
 According to the Australian sociologist J. A. Barnes's social network is a point system, one of which is:
one part is connected to the other.
 The points of that system are the people և those pointsthe connection lines indicate which people interact with each other ”[1, pp. 53-54].
 By enabling J. A. Barnes' approach as points
Not only people but also social groups and organizations will be observed.
 According to that, the social network is for individual people, social groupsամբողջ is a set of existing social ties between organizations.
The use of social networks is not accidental, as they are closely linked to the reputation of the organization.
 One of the scientific works of the Australian scientist Rosa de Carvalho is memorablededicated to managing the corporate reputation of the organization.
The peculiarity of the work is the title "Reputation management as a relationship management" [13].
  It is clear from the name that it is socialManaging interactions is crucial to managing an organization's reputation.
 But the management of relations is impossible without the use of other components of social capital.
  Basic of social capitalOne of the structural components is trust, the influence of whichThe assessment of social capital is ambiguous.
 American economist, philosopher, political scientist F. with Japanese roots. Fukuyama [9] emphasized the importance of trust as a component of social capital that promotes the organization's employees
interaction in the region, his most successful work and leading to an increase in the results of activities.
 Harvard University Professor R.D. Patnem [12] describes it as social
element of capital.
  Patnem believes that the stronger the relationship of trust and solidarity, the more individuals andThe more groups seek cooperation and mutual assistance, the moresocial capital accumulates a lot [5, pp. 210-211].
 E. L. Lesser [10]
According to him, "trust" is a separate concept; it can be both a source of social capital and its result.
  It is clear thatSocial capital և trust relations are quite complicated, somethingto the point of being entangled.
Social capital և the initial components of the latterAfter the review, let's move on to the no less valuable capital horse, which is:the symbol.
P. Bourdieu's conceptions of symbolic capital are often quite comprehensive.
 For example, one of the commentsis this? "Symbolic capital is any property perceived by social agents, any kind of capital, the categories of perception of which are such that they allow to know about it, to notice it, to give it value" [14, p. 116].
  This:The main point of sociological-economic definition is differentStakeholders in the recognition and evaluation of this or that object,which is identical in content to "corporate reputation"to understanding.
 A similar understanding can be found in Russian sociologist A. A.
In the concept of Mestnikov, who considers "symbolic capital" to be the marketCharacteristic of participants: manifested in influence, authority or recognition. "Եւ A potential factor in the venture capital market is the investment of symbolic capital as a market participant.
property (venture fund, management company) when it is perceived by other agents who, in their experience, are capable ofto give value to that property և to determine their position in relationwith that market participant.
  Պետ The state is the source of symbolic capital ”[4, p. 113].
It should be noted that specific P. Authority in Bourdieu's concept
symbolic capital along with trust, honor և ratingIt is one of the forms of externalization.
  Corporate reputation of the organizationIt is a form of symbolic capital, but it is closely intertwined with the social capital of the organization and is based on it.
Trust is a form of expressing symbolic capital at the same timeis an integral part of social capital.
  Accordingly, it is possibleview trust as a corridor between two capitalsbetween you (see Figure 1).
Trust:Symbolic of the organizationcapital:Organization social:capital:Figure 1. Social and symbolic capital of the organization ևthe link that connects them.
Thus, the initial formation of each organizationAt this stage, you should first think about creating a positive social network, norms and rules that will allow you to achieve over time.the confidence of the initial stakeholders.
  In turn, effectively managed social capital will serve as a basis for the acquisition and accumulation of symbolic capital.
 Undoubtedly, the accumulated symbolic capital, in its turn, will have a positive impact on the social capital of the organization.
 Accordingly, any organizationEnsuring a positive reputation is anchored on both the symbolic and social capital of the organization, as onesupports the other.
