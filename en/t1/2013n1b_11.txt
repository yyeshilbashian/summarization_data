The public demand for the formation of the "geopolitics" system in our republic is more than obvious.
  However, we need to develop this intellectual directionWe consider it not only from a worldview-scientific, but also from a practical-practical point of view.
  That is, the public demand for the scientific circles of our society is conditioned not only by the capacity of academic, but also by practical research.
 It is obvious that at first glance our judgments may be ambiguous, as it is 78th in the world, 134th in terms of population, 125th in terms of GDP, population.At the standard of living, it is impossible for the 84th country to imagine the ability to participate in geopolitical processes on its own.
However, we consider it necessary to emphasize that "geopolitics" we consider a discipline that is scientificreasonably discusses the geopolitical potential of statesAgainst the background of regional և global geopolitical processes (geopolitical challenges) arising from the Earthfrom the nature of the modern geopolitical structure.
  In this context, the Armenian statehood acquires a special significance, which we consider the main actor for the expression of national geopolitical ideas, the only precondition, the otherAn important area of ​​activity for actors.
In the professional literature on geopolitics, "actors" are defined as the totality of all people և structures that develop spatial-temporal conceptions of local, regional-global spaces; .
It is also obvious that a certain area is specificactors interact with other actors.
 And thatinteraction can be both collaborative andcontradictory nature.
Geopolitical actors at the scientific levelIn the practical plane they are anchored territorially (territorial)on the perceptions that their political behavior may և ևare the grounded elements.
  Accordingly, geopolitics distinguishes between the geopolitical notions of societal leaders, the "geopolitical formulas" that are aimed atwill affect the consciousness of members of society.
  That is thatResolutions simplify geopolitical notionsare condensed expressions that can affect the publicon consciousness.
The political behavior of geopolitical actors directly depends on the territorial features, the registration of which is a direct necessity in describing the actors.
Geopolitical actors stand out not only for themselveswith spatial features, but in space themselvesby the unique nature of the relationship.
As a consequence of all this, every geopoliticalThe actor historically defines the sphere of his special activity, the social layer, which will be a social pillar.
  That is, the actors are a unique tool of social control through their spatial activities.
Many geopolitical actors circulating in the professional literature are mainly classified as followsaccording to the principles:• Classical or traditional geopolitical actors, which:attribute to the state, the army, the church,• New geopolitical actors, including political onesparties, non-governmental organizations, military groups, economic structures, means and means of public communication,• Modern geopolitical actors.
  Assign to this groupare the organizations and individual groups that express certain geopolitical projects nationally (nationalist)or on religious ideological grounds.
Before discussing the actors of Armenian geopoliticsIt should be noted that the novelty and complexity of the research problem do not allow us to fully include in our view all the possible objects and subjects that can condition the content of the Armenian geopolitics.
 Moreover, it is not possible to exhaust the consideration of all the factors that determine the dynamics of a complex system integrated with natural processes within one research.
  Therefore, we consider the actors we have singled out only in a spatial sensefirst of all.
Based on the scientific-methodological peculiarities of geographical researches, we have conditionally included the actors of the Armenian geopolitics as follows:in groups:1. Armenian state.
 We consider it separately from other actors ևprimarily because we consider the Armenian stateexpression of national geopolitical ideasthe only precondition, the head of geopolitical processesobject և subject, a possible plane of activity of other actors.
2. Actors determining the Armenian geopolitical potential.
In this group we include two mutually agreed but relatively independent dimensions of potentialsocial և natural components.
We work for the social component of societystandard of living as geopolitical notionsand to express desires և to make them a realityYou need a certain amount of material satisfactiondegree.
For the natural component of the geopolitical potential, we consider the geopolitical demand of the state territory to be primary, and the factors of drinking water from the natural resource potential.
3. Classic actors of Armenian geopolitics.
The Armenian army should be considered in this group of actors, the Armenian oneThe Diaspora և the Armenian Church.
 The latter two are relatively independent and appear in separate historical regionscame as the main (sometimes even the only) link in the expression of national geopolitical ideas, howeverToday, in the conditions of the existence of the Armenian state, they become onlycommon components.
 Let us emphasize the fact that:in the field of realization of national geopolitical ideasThe new situation of the above-mentioned actors does not reduce, but is newUnderstand the meaning of the latter.
 The Armenian Diaspora եղ Church becomes important (but not independent or the only) actors in ensuring the viability of Armenian geopolitics.
As for the Armenian army, its strengthstate security և geopolitical independenceFrom this point of view, it is impossible to overestimate.
Such a logic of classification makes it a priorityThe observation of the Armenian statehood as the main, only precondition for the expression of national geopolitical ideas.
Let us emphasize that the state is the head of geopoliticsis the category.
  From the geopolitical point of view, the state is distinguished by three important functions: structure, legitimate authority, territory.
  That is, states are geopoliticalthe "main subjects" of the processes, the main objects.
We do not consider it superfluous to note that the Armenian nation has existed for centurieswas deprived of statehood, then was also deprived of nationalityfrom the real possibility of realizing geopolitical ideas.
  Due to the lack of statehood, these ideasThe obligation to express oneself, with very limited opportunities, has been taken over by various subjects: the church, in the DiasporaFormed organizations, separate social strata (businessmen, intellectuals) և individuals.
In the case of the Armenian republics formed in the 20th century, these entities continue to continue to maintain theirrelatively independent behavior in the field of geopolitical processes.
Often the independent behavior of the above-mentioned subjects contradictedto the implementation of common programs, thus reducing our overall potential to influence and even adapt to geopolitical processes.
  All this was especially evident during the existence of post-Soviet independent Armenia.
However, due to the Artsakh conflict, the activities of actors in the first years of independence were mainly in the field of realization of national geopolitical ideas.coincided, however, in the following years the development of the problem was differentrevealed trends.
  In particular, the realization of a common goal - the victorious outcome of the Artsakh war - raised priorities in national geopolitical perceptions.adjustment problem.
  The Republic of Armenia, to which objectivelywas reserved for the realization of national geopolitical goalsThe main role was gradually transferred to other actors.
Moreover, the Armenian Diaspora gained influence in regional and global geopolitical processesthe main function.
  In this case, the generalization of the geopolitical ideas of the Armenian state and the Armenian DiasporaThe main focus was the international pursuit of the Armenian Cause.
  This:He was subordinated to the issue to some extent - vital for ArmeniaAnother important issue is the final settlement of the Artsakh conflict.
In such a sub-category of national geopolitical notions, the strengthening of the Republic of Armenia was pushed into the background.
This issue was considered a possible, but not the only precondition for ensuring the realization of national goals in geopolitical, geoeconomic, geocultural domains.
 It has been proved many times in the world practice that the effectiveness of the realization of geopolitical ideas in the case of any ethno-cultural unit directly depended onfrom the power of the state.
 Even losers (Germany, Japan) orIn the countries with the most complex geopolitical hub (Israel, South Korea), the strengthening of the state բարձր raising the living standards of the society were considered the only preconditions:to ensure their geopolitical independence and influence in the geopolitical structure of the planet.
Let us emphasize one possible circumstance. The Republic of Armenia stands out with a high index of national homogeneity.
  Therefore, groups of national minorities representing a certain segment of society can not hinder the expression and realization of national geopolitical ideas.
  Moreover, thiscircumstance gives "Republic of Armenia" geopolitical subject additional advantages to refrain from constantly developing geopolitical geography in the regionfrom dangerous processes.
Thus, it is obvious that the only precondition for the realization of the geopolitical aspirations of the Armenian nation is a strong Armenianis the existence of a statehood, even if it is still a historical homelandin the section.
  The Republic of Armenia should not act as a separate link in the chain of Armenian geopolitical actors, but as the only sphere of activity of those links.
 Therefore,The main component of the resolution expressing national geopolitical ideas is a powerful state.Where:A - Armenian geopolitics,P - Armenian statehood.
This resolution confirms the fact that in general the content of national geopolitical ideas is a function of the degree of power of the Armenian statehood.
 That is, onlyA powerful Armenia can formulate a national geopolitics at all levels of the world geopolitical structureambitions.
Thus, observing the Armenian geopoliticsas a means of claiming the real place and role of the Armenian type in the modern world, presupposes the provision of a corresponding consciousness,which should be the core of the nation's geopolitical upbringingThe provision of a unique program, because, as one of the classics of geopolitics K. Hausofer aptly noted, "... eachThe problem of limiting the space available for the full-fledged vital activity of the nation must be realized by every stratum of society, every individual. ”
In our case, the creation of a united Armenia will be possibleOnly in the case when every citizen of the Republic of Armenia perceives it not only as a desire for moral victory, but also!the only justified opportunity to expand its habitat.
