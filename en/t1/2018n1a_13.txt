is about 4% less than the index.
 In general, the index observed during the last 10 years has shown instability. sharp increases
followed by as sharp declines as the current oneAnnual revenue from communication services is even less thanIt was in 2007 (in the mentioned year the index made 152.3 billion drams).
 The otherTariffs for communication services during the same periodThey are constantly decreasing.
  2007-2017 Tariffs for communication services

  Thus, during the observed period, the annual revenue from the Internet access service increased 9.2 times, from 5 billion drams to 45.1 billion drams.
 At the same time, the revenue of telephone (wired) service decreased by 4.4 times, reaching 201712.2 billion drams.
 As a result, the share of this service in the structure of telecommunication services has decreased from 1/3 to9%.

 It should be noted that a rather interesting picture is observed here, the volume of investments in the telecommunication sphere has been registered in sharp declines since 2000, until 2005. sustained growth was replaced by a sharp decline next year,
to almost zero level.
 Next, 2006-2009. A new phase of ascent was registered, which was replaced by a similar sharp decline in 2010.
 That's right,There has been a weak investment boom in the sector since 2012, but it is a question of the situation following the so-called "floor" of the recession, which is far from the beginning of positive qualitative changes.from being considered.

Number of subscribers in 2012-2017, thousand people [10]Despite the number of internet subscribers և internet usersGiven the rapid growth trends, it should be noted that Armenia's position in the Mediterranean is not so good.
  Thus, our relative fixed broadband internet subscription rate is oursAlthough the country slightly exceeds the level of middle-income countries, it is significantly behind its main EEU partners, namely the other two countries of the South Caucasus (on average,1.5 to 2.0 times), and with the average of European countriesmore than 3 times (Figure 1.9).
