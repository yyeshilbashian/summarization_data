The purpose of the work.
 The study and analysis of one of the components of the e-business infrastructure infrastructure, the telecommunications sector, in the context of a number of preconditions for the development of e-business in the Republic of Armenia.
Timeliness.
  Today, information and communication technologies are a key factor in ensuring socio-economic progress for each country, an indisputable precondition for integration into the world economy.
The use of ICT in various sectors of the economy leads to economic growth, increased labor productivity, reduced costs, the emergence of new types of economic activity.
European Commission 2010 According to the estimates of the report, 19952004. The 50% increase in labor productivity in the EU was due to the use of ICT.
 Moreover, there is also the opposite effect, when the development of other sectors of the economy contributes to the progress of the ICT sector, particularly in terms of generating new demand.
  In general, the creation of new, competitive products and services using high-tech solutions offers a wide range of ways to solve economic and social problems.
 E-business is a system that, including the classic ideas of business management, requires a certain basis for technological development.
 The establishment of the ICT sector is a basic precondition for the development of e-business in any country.
 Armenia is no exception in this respect.
 Therefore, in the context of a comprehensive study of the problems and conditions of e-business development in our country, the analysis of the ICT sector, in particular, telecommunications developments, potential opportunities and issues is of paramount importance.
The development of e-business in each country is conditioned by the existence of a number of preconditions, among which the sphere of ICT-communication, the legal support of e-business, the development of logistics infrastructures have special importance.
If we consider the above as a whole, we can talk about the e-business infrastructure system.
  Only the telecommunications sector as a component of the e-business infrastructure infrastructure has been studied and analyzed in the framework of this article.
2017 The annual revenue of communication service providers in Armenia amounted to 145.6 billion drams, which is about 4% less than the previous year.
 In general, the index observed during the last 10 years has shown instability. The sharp increases were followed by the same sharp declines as a result: at present the annual revenue from telecommunications services is even less than in 2007 (in the mentioned year the index made 152.3 billion drams).
 On the other hand, the tariffs for communication services have been steadily reduced during the same period.
  2007-2017 The index of changes in tariffs for communication services, compared to each previous year, averaged 98.4, and the chain index of changes in tariffs, compared to 2007, was 84.3 [1].
The structure of annual revenue from telecommunications services is dominated by revenue from telecommunications services (93.4% in 2017 [2]).
  There are 33 companies in the field of telecommunications in Armenia, which, according to NACE rev2, are classified as wireless telecommunication services (61.10), wireless telecommunications services (61.20), companies providing other telecommunications services (61.90), web portals (63). companies.
 The main services provided by these companies include mobile իք landline, cable մ wireless internet, IT infrastructure (for example, web hosting) և VoIP services.
  It should be noted that telecommunications companies provide their services to the domestic market rather than for export.
Revenues from telecommunications services are dominated by revenues from mobile services (in 2017 - 62 billion drams or 45.4%), followed by the share of Internet access services (45.1 billion drams or 33.2%).
  It is interesting that during the last 10 years quite remarkable tendencies are observed in the structure of telecommunication services (Figure 1.3).
  Thus, during the observed period, the annual revenue from the Internet access service increased 9.2 times, from 5 billion drams to 45.1 billion drams.
 At the same time, the revenue of telephone (wired) service decreased 4.4 times, reaching 12.2 billion drams in 2017.
 As a result, the share of this service in the structure of telecommunications services has decreased from 1/3 to% 9%.
Figure 1.3. The share of individual services in the structure of the annual revenue of telecommunication services, in 2007-2017, in percentages [4] The dynamics of investments in the telecommunications sector in Armenia, attractiveness ևThe dynamics of investments in the sector can be considered as a remarkable assessment (Figure 1.4).
 It should be noted that a rather interesting picture is observed here, the volume of investments in the telecommunication sphere has been registered in sharp declines since 2000, until 2005. Stable growth was replaced by a sharp decline to almost zero the following year.
 Next, 2006-2009. A new phase of ascent was registered, which was replaced by a similar sharp decline in 2010.
 It is true that there has been a weak investment boost in the sector since 2012, but we are talking about a situation following the so-called "floor" of the recession, which is far from the beginning of positive qualitative changes.
Figure 1.4. Private Investments in Telecommunications in Armenia, $ 1 million [11] 94% of the total revenue of the Internet services segment in Armenia is provided by four major Internet companies, one of which is an Armenian company, and the other three are foreign-owned companies.
  In 2017, the growth in the sphere of Internet services (cable, wireless և VoIP) had rather low rates, and the generated income amounted to 152.4 million US dollars (6.8% annual growth rate).
  The share of foreign companies in the volume of these services is 86% [5].
As a result of the process of development of public mobile communication networks տարածքում coverage expansion in the territory of the Republic of Armenia, in 2018 As of January 1, 2012, all settlements of the Republic of Armenia are provided with coverage of at least one public mobile operator.
  At the same time, 4.2% of the settlements are covered by 1 operator, 15.3% by 2 operators and 80.2% by 3 operators with public mobile communication coverage [6].
43% of companies providing Internet access services are companies with foreign participation.
The companies providing internet services in Armenia offer the following services in the domestic market: ADSL, fiber-optic cable internet, WiFi և WiMax wireless access technologies, general purpose packet radio communication (GPRS), EDGE, CDMA և 3G technologies (UMTS / WCDMA),
All settlements of the Republic of Armenia are provided with 3G technology of public mobile communication.
 2017 As of the end of the year, the number of mobile subscribers was about 3.5 million.
 The mobile communication network based on 4G / LTE technology has been developed, which is available in the settlements of the republic.
  At the same time, in 2018, it is planned to significantly expand the infrastructure of the 4G / LTE network in other settlements, as a result of which at least 88% of the interstate highways of the Republic of Armenia, as well as settlements, will be provided with 4G technology broadband internet coverage [7].
2017 As of the end of the year, the international "IP" transit flow throughput in the country amounted to 379000 Mbps, which increased by 12% compared to 2016, and more than 8 times during the last 5 years (Figure 1.5).
Figure 1.5. International IP Transit Service Flow Capacity 2008-2017 (Mbps) [8] As a result of the competition, due to the increase in international IP transit service flows, the tariff for that service has also decreased.
 2017 At the end of the year, the cost of transit IP flow with a speed of 1 Mbps was 1400 AMD / Mbps in 2016. decreased by about 53% compared to the end of the year, and during the last 5 years the index has decreased 6.5 times (Figure 1.6).
Figure 1.6. International IP Transit Service Tariff Dynamics 2008-2017 (AMD / Mbps) [9] In the retail market of broadband Internet access services (excluding mobile 3G), FTTx fiber-optic subscribers predominated, whose share in 2017 was about 51 percent.
 Moreover, in 2016 The number of FTTx subscribers has increased by about 17% compared to last year.
 At the same time, there was a decrease of about 12% in the number of subscribers with internet access with xDSL technology.
Tariff packages based on high-speed technologies (for example, FTTH) are widely used in the retail market, which are offered to consumers in both stand-alone and "Triple Play" format, including IP TV and telephony.
  In particular, in the market, with the package of "Three in One" services, with IP TV և telephone connection, internet flow rates from 20 Mb / s to 100 Mb / s are offered, with tariffs from 8500 AMD to 24000 AMD.
In the retail market, mobile operators have offered an innovative "Quad Play" service package with a combination of mobile communication, which includes telephony based on fixed communication technology, Internet access, IP TV, as well as mobile mobile telephony.
In general, the number of Internet access service subscribers (including mobile 3G և 2G) in 2017 amounted to 2.62 million, an increase of about 8.8% over the previous year.
 The volume of broadband internet access services has increased, the number of subscribers (including mobile 3G) in 2017 amounted to 2.27 million, which means that the number of subscribers has increased by 19% compared to the previous year, and over the last 5 years the figure has increased more. more than 2 times (Figure 1.7).
 The growth dynamics of the number of broadband subscribers in 2008-2017 is shown.
Figure 1.7. Number of subscribers with broadband internet access, thousand people [10] The volume of mobile broadband internet access services has increased, the number of subscribers at the end of 2016 amounted to 1.96 million, which means that the number of subscribers increased by 22% compared to the previous year. 1.8).
Figure 1.8. Number of mobile broadband internet subscribers in 2012-2017, thousand people [10] Despite the growing trend of internet subscribers և internet users, it should be noted that Armenia's position in the Mediterranean is not so good.
  Thus, the country with a relative ratio of fixed broadband internet subscriptions, although slightly higher than the level of middle-income countries, is significantly behind its main EEU partners, the other two countries in the South Caucasus (on average - 1.5 to 2.0 times), and the average of European countries Let's follow the index more than 3 times (Figure 1.9).
Figure 1.9. Fixed broadband internet subscriptions (per 100 inhabitants, 2016) [12] One of the key features of the e-business infrastructure system is the availability of secure Internet servers.
With this indicator, Armenia lags significantly behind the world average, somewhat behind some of its neighbors, but almost twice as high as the middle-income countries (Figure 1.10).

Figure 1.10. Number of secure Internet servers (per 1 million inhabitants), 2016 [13] Conclusion.
 Thus, it is obvious that in recent years the Republic of Armenia has significantly improved the indicators of one of the key components in the e-business infrastructure, the telecommunications sector, which, however, lags behind the global development trends.
  In this regard, the system of actions aimed at improving the indicators of the telecommunications sector occupies a key place in the list of priorities for e-business development in Armenia.
