One of the inner faces of modern prose is Diana Hambardzumyan, an original prose writer, publicist, literary critic, well-appreciated cultural figure, well known to Armenian and foreign readers, for her incomparable translation activities.
  Discussing the intricacies of life, with an irreconcilable pen, far from ambitious thoughts, the writer argues for true, beautiful, caring values, neither as a fruitless hour-seller, nor as sure that he is unsurpassed.
 The prose writer has disobedient and old-fashioned thoughts.
 A pen that reveals the flaws of the problems of our time, makes the earthly pain and sorrow visible, shows the bankruptcy of sales, trained in the power of the true word.
 Each of his works explores the current social problems and reveals new layers of human relations.
 Making writing a means of self-expression, Diana Hambardzumyan has repeatedly referred to these issues and issues in works of art and articles, interviews and reviews of different years.
  His answers in the interviews complement each other, presenting not only the prose, but also the moving-developing nature of aesthetics.
"A person who appears in the eternal corridor of time, just a moment between his death and birth, wants to immortalize himself with the beauty of being conveyed to beauty," writes literary critic Zhenya Kalantaryan [1,218].
  With the pursuit of beauty and perfection, Diana Hambardzumyan strives to discover human care and truth, to reflect her life experience and knowledge in works of art, to reach the edge of truth in the way of human beings, rejecting fabricated and plastered literature.
Diana Hambardzumyan, while flipping through the social and caring layers of a modern reality full of unspeakable complexities, with the ability to utter the unusual, refers to the revelation of the foundations of human and national existence, voicing her painful thoughts that bring the message and the target, sometimes tarnished by family sacred morals. sometimes with a barrier between the real and the imaginary.
 The family is one of the masterpieces of nature. It is an absolute sanctity of the Armenian people, the bearer and transmitter of traditions, customs, many other features, the hearth of rights and responsibilities, a union forged by mutual responsibility with its unconditional laws and rules.
 It is the bearer of the national feature and image.
In a family flooded with love and happiness, husband and wife are the ones who do not upset the balance of the world with their sense of duty and responsibility to each other.
Diana Hambardzumyan is the protagonist of the story of the same name in the title of "Arab".
  The song, being a solid work, is distinguished by psychological justification, unique structure, convincing psychoanalytic descriptions.
  "The writer draws attention to the moral behavior of people, the faults of their faults, because of which history becomes destiny" a punishment prescribed by God "[3].
 In addition to these features, the sky stands out with interesting chronotopic transitions.
 The present of the story begins with the search for a beloved human being, Arambi, who lives in despair. He walks door to door, without thinking about decency and shame, walks from house to house, constantly knocking on the door, hoping to find the one he loved and lost.
According to the Russian literary critic AB Yesin. "The problem is why Jhan achieves self-humiliation. it has a socio-cultural context, which is expressed in the idea of ​​affirming honor and inner dignity, not accepting or rejecting voluntary service ”[4,41].
  To the question of Arsho, who lives in one of the houses, who are you, what do you want, the hero of the story answers: I am an Arab. He said that he was married, a woman who had gone to a man (AN).
  "Don't you have a name?"
 - Arsho's question is answered with a certain article as an answer that sounds like a personal name. "I am Arab."
Then, by presenting comprehensive, typical actions, the writer touches upon the creation of such issues, problems as patterns, action, psychology, ideology, style problems, art.
  The plot of the song is far from ordinary.
 This is the discovery of what happened in the dark and invisible depths of man, the "excavations" of which lead the writer to the references to the hero's behavior.
Diana Hambardzumyan creates original patterns of artistic iconography. "If I knew I would apologize, I would forgive you, I would run, kneel before your image and open my hands and beg, but I know that what I did was a pig that you forgive me, I will not forgive me." [2]
 The book of folk wisdom, the Bible, says: "And if the woman does not want to come after you, then you are invincible" [5,25].
According to the original principle of realization of artistic speech D. By examining the eternal problems inherent in human existence, Hambardzumyan discovers the reflection of the cosmic soul, conditioning everything in the eternity with love, which is the key to the mystery of saving the world.
 The writer's worldview reveals various combinations of artistic meaning of the material, presenting the sequential development of events, observing it in the film, a real tangible, which has a unique aesthetic and moral impact on the reader.
  The tendency to weigh the nature of life with human emotions leads to the prose writer's philosophical understanding that the spirit that balances the world, love, beats in everyone's soul. "… Familiar turmoil… Why?… Who can explain how it all begins?
 What name can they give it? Suffering, grief, pity, devotion, self-forgetfulness, or they say, love, love, because none of them are all together, or it is a pain inflicted by some writer, from which it is impossible to cure, humanity has not invented anything that kills its cause. որ so that you can insure yourself against all future infections, gain immunity and be saved… "[2].
In the realm of authentic events of the story, the writer creates certain manifestations of the character's behavior, which reveal his worldly feelings.
"Arab girl," he whispered to himself, "what have you lost in this darkness and cold at these unknown doors?"
 Now the dog does not come out of the nest, are you so headstrong that you set off and go wherever your eye cuts? Hh, go back, as soon as you hang your leg, a trouble will come to your head, hurry up, hurry up! »[2].
The moral and psychological description of the hero, the intrusions made through conscious speech, create a convincing and visible artistic environment on a fact-authentic basis, although the reader is unaware of the complexity of the Arabian marital relationship, the fact that he is happy or unhappy on the family floor. (jealousy, which is a way of expressing love: "Do you see now who traps him with his wise thoughts?" [2].
 The weightless becomes the vision, the motive of the marginal belief that proves love and devotion).
The reader feels the development of the main character, the suffering, pain and love chain of Arambi.
 Moral and psychological, philosophical and aesthetic questions are closely intertwined in Diana Hambardzumyan's story, as in real life.
Thoughts about life and love seem to flow spontaneously, however, Diana Hambardzumyan holds the spring of their expansion firmly in her hand, she uses it from her point of view of worldview and humanity, her understanding of the role of literature.
 In the struggle of conscience and intellect, he is satisfied that he has the opportunity to find a loved one, through whom the writer, through his compassion and repentance, denies the suffering of the woman's soul, "gradually making visible the new quality of thinking of the literary new generation" [2,195].
The woman is the creator and originator not only as the mother, as the custodian and transmitter of the genetic code of the race, but also the basis for the preservation of the nation, the apostle who creates a family, for the sake of which love is sometimes sacrificed.
 Arsho's words to Vachagan Barikyan are very eloquent in terms of the existence of the family. "Was it the woman who came out of your house, and I said, 'You have come to your senses, you will bring a woman, put this house in order so that it smells like a house.'" [2]
    Alexander Shirvanzade's work "Arabi" is a completely different analysis of women's psychology and self-esteem.
   Both in volume and content, in two different works with the same titles, different problems existing at times in completely different epochs are examined, which are different observations of the writers, with different interpretations of views, with unique interpretations of losses.
   In Shirvanzade's novel, the events take place in the second half of the 19th century, when there were cruel responsibilities, the fulfillment of which was strictly obligatory for every person.
 Honor implies a feeling higher than interest. The activity of that individual, his position in the society is connected with the high spheres of socially acceptable morality, an indicator of his social value.
 The social psychology of a person is expressed in honor.
 The issue of marriage is a social and moral order, hence the unique criteria of possession and evaluation.
 It is clear from the plot of the novel that Varvara is not a girl, but a married woman, an Arab, who boldly left her immoral, immoral husband.
"What should poor Varvara do? They took him, married him by force to a useless, mutilated man and said: "Suffer in his hand, whether you like it or not, suffer" [7, 246].
  The husband was only related to the wife.
 There was no mental connection between him and Varvara.
 A family is formed, on the basis of external motivations and preconditions (father's will, consideration of wealth, youthful circle of passion, etc.).
  The spiritual world of feelings and emotions has become deserted by giving in to the urges of the father without loving or hating.
  The groom with immoral behavior is cunning, he married twice for the sake of profit.
 He is the only heir of his uncle. After acquiring his inheritance, he indulges in lewd pleasures. He flees to Odessa with the actress, making the young woman unhappy.
  On the other hand, by tyrannizing his daughter's feelings of self-sacrifice and respect, the tyrannical father selfishly destroys his daughter's youth.
  Modesty and beauty are surrendered to modern respect.
  But what can Rostomyan do when he hears his father's unwavering voice as he reads the inspired verses of the Bible? "Do not sit with anyone, - ... or, - The woman of the Arabian woman is bound by her law" [7, 282, 283].
 This is the inseparable bond of the Law of centuries-old tradition.
 Thus, two powerful threats hang over Varvara like a sword of Damocles: society and religion.
 Evanku, the nights flooded with sorrowful tears, were not able to present the hopeless situation that throws him to bed, leading to his death.
 Because of the cold, heartless rules, superstitious society, Varvara no longer has the right to love, moreover, he is deprived of that right, because of the terrible strictness and arbitrariness of the society, individual freedom is taken away, he is forced to accept what is disgusting, which disturbs happiness.
  And will the society have the right to throw the burden of the burden on the shoulders of a young, plump woman, who is full of love, to live and create with infinite wealth?
  "Rostomyan և Varvareiz sensation makes the daughter of a kind-hearted housewife the property of a well-known gossip society, a secretly unfaithful, malicious, jealous and arrogant Cato," adding one to five "" [8, 355].
becomes, it Al. In both of Shirvanzade, Minas Kirilich, realizing that reconciling and re-living with a hated husband is beyond the power of girls, ending the battle of emotional feelings, meeting public opinion, demands that the girl live with a church-married husband. Here is how influential the influence of public opinion is on an individual's social psychology. "Վ Varvara, hugging her father's feet, was looking pleadingly հայ at his fierce face… hitting the girl's breast with the tip of her slipper… shouting… go, I am a girl… She died for me, oh, if she died at the age of others" [7, 273] .
The tyrannical public opinion erases in the individual, destroys all independence, իկը the girl solves the dilemma that storms in the soul for the sake of her father's honor, sacrificing personal happiness.
   Al. The depiction of Shirvanzade's personal tragedy created under the influence of the morals of the time becomes a description of the multifaceted moral and psychological realm of a whole social class և has a cultural mission based on pragmatic philosophy.
   Concluding the substantive examination of the works, it is impossible to talk about the linguistic peculiarities of Diana Hambardzumyan's story "Arab".
In Diana Hambardzumyan's story, the word can be used.
  We follow the development of actions with his subtly chosen, sometimes also created, proverbs, sayings, phrases and ambiguous words, with the application of different layers of language.
 Individual linguistic units become unique means of completing that part of the story, bringing the announcer.
The aim of the author is not only to describe and depict what has happened, but as an artist, to present a human drama, depicting the kinship of mental states and the accuracy of actions by the self-created creation of linguistic means.
 Phrases that present philosophical reflections, sayings typical of everyday life and lifestyle, typical of the colloquial style, create typical images of the image, environment and events, giving emotional color to the word, at the same time contributing to the contemplation and brevity.
   There are a lot of folklore proverbs that express the ideas of human thoughts in an allegorical way, such as, for example, on horseback, I am looking for a horse, oh, don't let a donkey die, spring will come, you will eat alfalfa, what have you lost now and in the cold? at the unknown door, now the dog is coming out of the nest, how many heads are you, that you have set off and are going wherever you can see, where is the modern Heghnar in a hurry now, the mission of the savior is an exhausted option, sit on the throne so that luck will come to you soon Soon, all of them are a canvas of sand, they decorate your life to make it hell right away and not to vote, the time to cry will come, now it will gather you, so shake the pebbles, touch them, eh, it's a lifeless life, who needs , charity is your main job or you do this work by hand.
   There are realities, human thoughts and ideas, directly առանց, without allegorical mediation. Oh, if you are deaf, you are deaf, so gather your backpack, close your patterned dreams and do not vote, you are a boy, show your face, say what you have to say, otherwise you will hit from behind, who can't?
 He is not a man (instructional saying), the smallest duty of a man is to be happy, which if he does not do, no punishment is prescribed, see if he now falls into the trap with his wise thoughts, does not die, I became a beggar, the savior mission is a long-exhausted option, and he is an Arab (it is a complex sentence, the first component is taken, the ordinary sentence creates a contrast to the proverb, has the meaning of a pronoun: the word or phrase is used instead of another word with which it has a logical, causal relation), although it is good to go in the world of this prostitute. thought, of instructive nature).
  There are many everyday, colloquial-style verbal units - phrases, which are linguistic units of national thinking, due to which the manners and customs, life and lifestyle of the given people are expressed, as well as their typical mental, psychological temperament and bio-philosophy.
 They express the national thinking of each individual, and in this respect contribute to the popularity of the language.
  For example, now he has come, he offers medicine and medicine, tomorrow he will not cry like that, no matter how much you cry, he will not take off his mask, as if he was not the one who fell on his feet and hands today. Like the bankrupt owner of a charity, they avoid the usual customer of charity (figurative image), because charity has become paid.
  The time to cry will come, now it will gather you (phrase based on a metaphorical image).
 There is an example of an oxymoron or antidote in the text: paid charity.
 According to prof. L. According to Yezekyan, they are "syntactic structures composed of logically incompatible concepts with different words and containing opposite elements" [9, 238].
   Thus, referring to the two works of Alexander Shirvanzade և Diana Hambardzumyan with the same title, we tried to present different moral and psychological terms of Arabi, to discover unique interpretations of losses through the prism of different views of the two writers, which are different worldviews with completely different weights.
        However, both Al. Shirvanzade or D. They make Hambardzumyan visible the immeasurable - love and devotion, which is put on the stack of beliefs and becomes a worldview, a way of adapting or not adapting to the social and everyday circumstances of their time.
