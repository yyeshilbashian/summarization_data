The world is changing at an unprecedented rate.
  The demands of life, dictated by them, are constantly changing unpredictablythe imperatives from which no sphere of life can escape.
  This:everywhere in the rapidly changing reality և the constant manfinds himself in unprecedented situations.
 And it can't be found all the timethe one the teacher who will give a ready answer or will do something for the person.
  So, today more than ever, manProtection requires literacy, awareness of situations in which a person often finds himself notWillingly or unwillingly.
The process of change has also invaded the education sectorall levels: general education, university և postgraduatesystem.
   Information attacks like a torrent.
 And as in many other cases, adolescents are considered a vulnerable group in this caseilliterate, ignorant youth.
  Among others, which article:are not the problem, there are constant work plans in the university,Update of subject programs aimed at the youthraising awareness as a human immune systema citizen ready to respond to the challenges of timeupbringing.
GGPI Faculty of Natural Sciences and Geography, Department of BiologyIt has been two years since he graduated from the Department of BiologyThe "Healthy Lifestyle" course was introduced on the proposal, for which a university program was developed, based on the school curriculum, taking into account the age and education of the students.degree.
Let's present the reasons that dictated it allPedagogical higher education in specialtiesOur suggestion about the need to include the "Healthy Lifestyle" course in the plans.
First of all, it was conditioned by the fact that in recent years this subject has become compulsory in the 8-9th grades of the secondary school, and from the 2011-2012 academic year, also in the 10-11th grades of the high school.in the classroom, which proves the importance of the subject.
  Besides, In the future, the right to teach in high school is envisagedOr at least only a pedagogue with a master's degree should have an advantage.
  Without discussing the reasons, let us mention that on the one hand, the university cannotto have the qualification of a "Healthy Lifestyle" teacherprofessional department, on the other hand, any literate, pedagogically educated person, being familiar with "Healthy Lifestyle" schoolcan teach the subject curriculum and teaching methods.
 Note that the subject in school during the above yearshave been taught by various specialists, passing only relevant training courses, which, of course, is far from today.meeting the requirements of the school.
 Therefore, it is advisable to organize an "ambulance" for the schoolfinds educational in all pedagogical specialties of the universityIntroduce a "Healthy Lifestyle" course in your plans, ensuring:Preliminary training of any specialist qualified as a teacher to teach the subject.
On the other hand, many of the most difficult issues facing humanity in the 21st century have to do with the individual and the publichealth care.
 Alcohol abuse, tobacco and drug use are considered health threats today.various forms of violence, human trafficking, premature and unwanted pregnancies, HIV infection and sexually transmitted diseases, stress levels, sex discriminationև etc. [1; 3].
 And to avoid all the possible causes listed as a threat to health, as a means of protecting a person, it is not only certain medical and biological knowledgeis a need that is not available to everyone, but is undeniably responsible for the personthe manifestation of behavior in every unpredictable situation.
  And:The most favorable condition for the development of responsible behaviorLiteracy and awareness of all these issues.
That goal is the main one during the study of the "Healthy Lifestyle" course.
 In order to achieve that, we have used a methodology that is not yet typical of higher education, an interactive methodology, the features of which we will present below.
Every problem in the classroom is mastered not only theoreticallyby studying the material, but by discussing the textbooks, pedagogues, real or supposed situational options suggested by any student within the given topic, legal documents and laws related to the responsibilities and rights of the person in each specific situation [4,5].
  Moreover, each issue is analyzed with a multifaceted approach, positive and negativeBy discussing the possible ways to prevent the occurrence of parties, causes, consequences, the most characteristic principle of interactive learning, that is, is criticized not the person, but the idea, the way of execution.
This method of working has many advantages, solves goals that are almost impossible with the traditional teaching method or not.very effective.
 Here are some of them:• In the process of teaching, the lecturer changes from a decision-maker, a demander, a dictator to an observer, mentor, supporter, and encourager [2].
  His:The opinion, equal to the opinion of all the participants in the debate, is subject to criticism, rejection and supplementation by the discussants.
 And if we add that the subject of debate is almost always our realityThe main issues that are not allowed for free discussion are:already mentioned above, then it will become clear that what is describedwill create an atmosphere of mutual trust in the audience, andThe latter is a guarantee of achieving high teaching efficiency.
• Question analysis process involving the lecturer as an equal who does not have an opinion or specific knowledge on the issuehis right, as well as the right of everyone to have an opinionRespect increases the learner's ease and confidenceon their own, make it possible from different complexesliberation.
• In the situation described, the lecturer can become trustworthy andAn open person to consult on the most difficult personal and situational issues that concern him or her.
 SuchHaving a literate and trustworthy friend for every teenager and teenagerwill help you to get rid of stressful situations as much as possiblepreventing many undesirable phenomena in society distribution.
Each learner will have the opportunity in lifein addition to acquiring useful academic knowledge, to master a lotskills and abilities, such as listening to others,complementing, respecting, making independent decisions, finding solutions,supporting others, learning or mastering the rules of cooperation,Gaining the ability to say "no" և etc.
• The wealth of knowledge acquired by everyone in the context of pluralism will contribute to the formation and development of a sense of responsibility for their own behavior as a guarantee of protection in the most unpredictable situations, asthe reduction of aggression in various human relationships.
In order to achieve the expected result, the high level of general development, professional, pedagogical and methodological training of the lecturer is undeniable, that in pedagogyThe most important thing is one's own work, as well as the ability to love others.
Developed by the Chair for Course MethodologyOne of the features is that it does not require a unitevaluation.
  The highest grade of the course is սեփականensuring the health of the people around them and protection (including legal protection) in various unprecedented situationsis the acquisition of contributing knowledge and the expression of required behaviors,which, we hope, is the students' interest in learning has the potential to increase.
  The discussion of each topic endsby test.
  And at the end of the course you can do itcompetition - individual or team, depending on the number of students orfrom the purpose.
   Two years of experience in teaching the subject at the facultyallows to assure that the subject provided through the tasksMany have been solved.
  The interest of the students in that group has increased, the desire to actively participate in the lesson, the interest.
  The "Healthy Lifestyle" course was highly praised by the students as a very useful and useful knowledge andskills-forming, in relation to existing phenomenaknowledge that helps change attitudes and thinkingcourse.
In our opinion, the subject has a great opportunity, among othersto nurture և reinforce responsibility for one's own behavior that can invisibly become և of characterline, life - in any situation, education in general, responsibility and diligence for each casefor raising և etc.
Taking into account the above, we suggest: 1) Make the "Healthy Lifestyle" course inter-institutionalsubject to enable any graduate to teach that course.
2) The course in the Master of Biology of the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Geography as a subject in general education schoolsThe most likely professional trainer to teach, continueMaster's program in the 2nd year, deepening the teaching content and methodology.
3) To offer the relevant general education institutions to try to include the course in schools in the compulsory thematic plan of the teachers in order to discuss the program issues during the lessons.for.
  4) To ensure proper treatment of the subject, as:to take the opportunity to choose the best teacher to teach the subject at school, to take into account a number of extracurricular activities, such as essay competitions, and healthy lifestyles, in different classrooms.the results of debates on topics.
 They can be"A person living with HIV", "A person whose relative has HIV", "A healthy person,around which there are people living with HIV "և other topics, whichThe following issues may be discussed:a) What do people with HIV need, what do they expect from those around them, close ones, who can they turn to with different problems?
b) What can society, in general, anyone do?To prevent HIV infection.
c) Who is most at risk of HIV infection, etc.?
 [2]
In the process of organizing events on the mentioned topicsIt is desirable to involve pedagogical students in the school.
5) The winners of all types of competitions will get some educationSupportive encouragement.
Competitive reporting ող Incentive incentives, in our opinion, can be a means of promoting learner պատասխանատվ responsibility բարձր improving the quality of learning.
