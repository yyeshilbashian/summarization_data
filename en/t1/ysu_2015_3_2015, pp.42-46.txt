TBILISI, THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TBILISI IN AGHAS AYVAZYAN'S WORK "In that country lies J. The magnificent city of Tbilissi (Georgia) is surrounded by suburbs and mansions inhabited by Christian Armenians, Georgians, and Jews. ”
Marco Polo, 1286 Tbilissi (Georgia) has always been the largest center of education and trade in the Caucasus.
  It has played a great role in Armenian life, particularly in literature.
 The name of Tbilissi is connected with such great people as Naghash Hovnatan, Sayat-Nova, G. Sundukyan, Hovh. Tumanyan, in modern literature: Agh. Ayvazyan.
Salt. Ayvazyan, being acquainted with the city of Tbilissi, got to know and introduce to the readers the world of Tbilissi and the life of the people of Tbilissi.
 Tbilissi (Georgia) has emerged as a unique image, a collective whole, from which many ideas originate.
 Tbilissi (Georgia) is a world, an area inhabited by people who are united to that world.
The author depicts Tbilissi by presenting every detail related to it.
 Tbilissi (Georgia) presents characters typical of the essay genre, presented in a complete picture.
"The literature examines the types and characters in which the documentary or publicist lines are not merely personal, they act not as a means, but as a genre-creating factor" 1.
Aghasi Ayvazyan, intertwining the artistic with the documentary, to some extent also with the publicist terms, manages to depict the comprehensive and unique image of Tbilissi.
Noting that essay literature is not identical with fiction, but acts as an independent type in the genre system of literature, let us add that the facts are interpreted here in such a way that the literary work acquires artistic and aesthetic value along with its cognitive significance.
  The writer weaves such an intertwining of aesthetic evidence that in addition to the description of Tbilissi (Tbilisi), various human relations, we fully understand the physiology of Tbilissi (Tbilisi).
 "Physiologies" came into being when a special interest in art and society arose in the society or in particular 1 "Literary Genres", Yerevan, 1973, p. 397.
to the characters.
 The physiological allusion, or the allusion to morals, finally taking shape and appearing in the 1840s, gained great power by many.
  Due to that, the object of interest becomes definite, standardized.
 It is not accidental that in 1850-1860. The genre of typological hint finds its application.
Salt. In Ayvazyan's work we see Tbilissi with its borders, horses, what it has and what it does not have. Probably Chuguret, crowded streets like them, Sheitan Bazaar, the Kura River with its bridges, Tbilissi (Georgia) and the joys, hopes and lost dreams.
  With all this, the city is typically characterized, ակն the essay genre we have mentioned requires its influence, of course, within the limits of a work of art.
F. Dostoevsky wrote: "Look after a fact in real life, not so obvious at first glance, և if you are able և you have an eye, then you will find in it a depth that Shakespeare does not have… but isn't it that someone should notice them, cover լուս write և." not only to create, to write a work of art, but only to notice the fact, one must be a kind of inter-artist ”1.
I am convinced that Ayvazyan is one of the artists who sees and notices and builds his works on that basis.
H. are examples of physiology in Armenian literature. Paronyan's series "A tour in the districts of Istanbul", where K. The district life and manners of Constantinople, H. Matosyan's "Ahnidzor" hint, which is a typical description of the author's birthplace.
And what is it, what is the physiology of Tbilissi?
Tbilissi (Georgia) lives with its people, and they live in every corner of Tbilissi (Tbilisi), in different streets that collect those corners, and they are distinguished by their special signs, which are the flags of every street. Tablet in Havlabar. Душа рай Tablet in Ortachala. Guest Table in Sheitan Bazaar. Bar-Katso, Man-Okmin This is how the Tbilissi (Georgia) world begins, this is the basis of its physiology.
"Tbilissi (Georgia) was a bit of a bitch, a little bit wise, a little bit extravagant, a knight and a bitch."
  The Tbilissi (Tbilisi) characters were completed on the basis of the characters of its Sirachkhana, Sololak, Chughuret, Narighala and other districts.
 All of them are the bearers of the same nature, the same physiology.
"Chughuret was the district of Tbilissi, his own son, maybe the middle one, the eldest among the youngest students, but the relative fell from his nose, blood from blood, water from the water. page 401.

What he was in Tbilissi (Georgia), he was the heart, he was the lungs, he was the intestines, it did not matter.
This is an accurate picture of the physiology of Tbilissi, a description of some kind of structure, of a solution.
  Tbilissi (Georgia) is personified, it lives and breathes every part of it, they are deficient "organs", without which the "organism" would not exist, or it would be incomplete, "unhealthy".
It can be said that the main district of Tbilissi (Tbilisi), even including the whole city, is Havlabar.
 The author gives the description of this district especially in the story "Gospel according to Havlabar".
"Everything is shaking from Havlabar!"
  The whole of Tbilissi with its outpost: Sheytan Bazaar, Yerchanyan Square, Sapni Street, Ts. The theaters of Mr. Khatisov, Melik Kazarov J. Mrs. Salomka's crosses are screaming from Havlabar. the money collected in Martiruz's mattress.
In addition to the visible object, even the diseases and dreams and sorrows of Tbilissi can be seen from Havlabar.
Here is Golovinsky Street, big and luxurious.
  The sign on this street is a little different. Some genius artist has painted a hand with the index finger inside the alley, and under it it is written: "Hadi po thumbam".
"He will take us through crooked, small and narrow streets, where sadness tastes like wine, և time gives bubbles like vinegar" 3.
In general, in hints that are a sample of physiology, when a geographical area is presented, its geography is given to each other first, then the description of the landscape, living conditions, even the depiction of climate change, etc.
Salt. Ayvazyan completely presents the geographical physiology of Tbilissi.
The story entitled "Tbilisi City Guide, 1912" is, perhaps, the only work where the gradual change of climate is specifically mentioned. "The air pressure in Tbilissi (Georgia) is 706, on Commercial Tamash - 404, on Vorontsov-Dashkov - 308".
The most important "organ" of Tbilissi (Georgia), part of which is Kurn. "In the middle of Tbilissi (Georgia) Kura flows day and night, wearing a hat on his head, ashamed for the stones protruding from his shallow body, spreading a foam on the shores, whispering to a basket. Then he stands up, listening to the sounds of tar and kamancha heard from the balconies hanging on the water, then returns to sigh again from Sayat-Nova's murmur. »4.
Hence the connection between the "generations" of the times.
Kura is eternal in Tbilissi (Georgia), he is with his people, even if the help is a few fish or not.
 This part of the city, even more so the blood vessel, is inextricably linked to its country.
  Kura patiently spits saliva and soot, digests the garbage ի he sadly knows that his owner is Tbilissi, and he is inseparable from him.

Хади по палцам, և you will see Tbilissi (Tbilisi) steamship companies in Kriap: "Severnoe parakhodstvo", "German Lloyd", "Austrian Lloyd", etc.
You will see Kochkochan bringing sewage through a tunnel, which is like Tbilissi (Georgia) Niagara.
Tbilissi becomes united by bridges. "There are six bridges on the bend: Mikhailovsky, Vera, Mukhransky, Havlabar, Metekhi and the most famous - Mnatsakanov J." 1.
Bridges not only complete the geographical description, but also become a haven for people who miss the heat and warm room.
Many people make up for their shortages or resort to misery in Tbilissi (Georgia) and underground pubs.
  Such as the "Sympathy" winery, whose 18-step staircase was "difficult to go down, even more difficult to climb", or the Sarkisov wine cellar, where "drunkenness is worth an abas, J. It means that the price of suffocation is a pound. "
People are no less interested in the city's sanctuaries, such as St. The monastery of Makari or the monastery of God, մի a different name or the monastery of Satan.
 This, unfortunately, is a definition of people's faith or superstition in terms of making their lives better or worse.
Tbilissi seems to be a moving, breathing, living being. "Through the crooked streets, the blood was lost in those streets."
 People were bending up, coming and going, և until they came out on the main street, they were passing through the Tbilissi yards բ.
The yards of Tbilissi are special.
 The writer thinks that they were not built, but invented by magicians.
"They watered the yard with wine, swept it with a bunch of tarragon."
  The yards of Tbilissi (Georgia) are as soft and quiet as ever.
  It is interesting that all the yards, as if they were born from each other, are the same!
  The words uttered years ago, the sound of footsteps can still be felt in those yards: "And in the evenings և at night those sounds come out, go around the yard, wash under the tap…. "The yard is breathing again."
 The houses and balconies of Tbilissi (Georgia) generalize their yards, as if they are talking to every passer-by or becoming a silent witness to their lives.
