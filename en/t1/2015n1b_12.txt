Attitudes toward children with special needs have not been the same in different historical periods.
  Along with civilization, the universal human worldview ընկ has experienced a typical development.
 People are always afraid again, of what is unknown, of which they do not yet know.
  Man tends to choose in life what is easy որեն socially acceptable.
 Irrespective of the peculiarities of human individual perception, society sets universal standards for its evaluation; people tend to take back what has already been created.
  Public opinion, position have a chain reaction of spread, ժամանակ requires maturity to be included in any new chain.
 The negative attitude of the society towards the children with special needs has always been based on the observation of them as "different", "different", which is one of the main reasons for the fear of accepting them equally.
  As mentioned by T. Salomyakin. "We look for criteria in each person, by which they differ from the others.
 And why do we look for that weak link in man?
  Where, then, are the richness and diversity of life? ”[3, p. 45].
 Being different does not mean being flawed or wrong.
 The experience of each human species diversity begins with perceiving them as they are, one should focus not on what is not there, but to love them as a whole.
According to Vigodsky, the main gap in the education and upbringing of abnormal children is due to the inability of the pedagogue to see his social nature in a defect.
 The main problems are not caused due to the underdevelopment of the child, but as a result of the inadequate perception given to them by the society.
 And any restorative, corrective work must have one main, primary goal. Stimulating the child's development based on need, which will enable the child to be flexible in society.
"Every child's potential և strengths should be decisive in creating curricula, not looking for weaknesses.
  It would be better to look for the strengths և to recognize that they should be different for different children.
 The difference is hope, as opportunities for development, education, and personal fulfillment are provided.
 We should be happy for that վ rely on them.
 They are, after all, real-life particles. ”[7, p. 941].
 Each word, definition creates thinking, which determines the essence of further objective activity.
Therefore, the more the definitions tend to rely on the strengths, the more effective the professional development of the child երեխայի the probability of growth and development.
  The possibilities of human realization have no specific boundaries or patterns.
 Just as the real discovery and realization of the potential of a child with special needs has no specific limits, so the abilities and possibilities of the discoverer. Real abilities can be manifested only in the conditions of appropriate social conditions, therefore this process has a mutually stimulating and developing significance.
The full development of each child is realized as a result of the interaction of biological and social processes.
  Regardless of the child's developmental characteristics և the nature of the need, he / she has the primary need to communicate with his / her peers կիս to share the experience.
  The importance of inclusion should not be underestimated not only for children with insufficient intellect, but for the society as a whole.
  According to the parent of a child with a complex structural disorder, “in a team of healthy, positively disposed peers, one day gave the child more than one month of rehabilitation work.
  It is possible that it allowed to open the secret compensatory possibilities of the organism.
  The child became more self-confident and began to actively interact with the world around him. "[4]
The inclusion of children with special needs will not only have a positive effect on the facilitation of their mental development, but also on the development of "moral norms and values" for the humanitarian development of healthy children studying with them.
 "The development and expansion of the practice of integration in the field of general, additional special education will allow not only children with special needs to become full members of society, but also to teach other children to actively empathize, but to think and help other people.
  "Integration experiments already show that healthy children do not show a negative attitude towards children with hearing, visual, motor disabilities, but show positive, in extreme cases, indifference" [6, pp. 38-41].
 This is evidenced by the regular visits of children of different age groups to the "Orphanage" specialized orphanage in Gyumri and the existence of positive interactions between them.
According to Vygodsky, the level of potential development of the child can be increased by more capable couples.
  This confirms the result of the facilitation of children's interaction.
 Eventually the child's mental processes and functions are formed ենDevelops in the context of social relationships, ևThe child becomes more effective in the process of socialization among his peers.
  These theoretical points were confirmed by the observations held in the mentioned orphanage, when there was a change in the composition of the children in the group rooms, due to the recruitment of more effective children.
 Less functional children discovered their potential more quickly in a short period of time, as the influence of more effective peers had a stimulating effect on their developmental growth.
  Some of the children even started walking, who, according to the medical instructions, were unable to walk, made progress in using walkers, standing, trying to walk on a stick, improved the speech of others, communication elements and children's own initiative in various activities.
 A striking example of modern integration is the Australian Integrative Theater, in which people with insufficient intellect participate (Restless Dance Company). The basic premise was that people with developmental disabilities become a source of inspiration in any dance group for couples without disabilities [4, p. 13].
As a result of children's cooperation and mutual assistance, many authors have referred to the effectiveness of development.
Katz found that behavioral self-regulation improved when seniors reminded younger ones of the rules of parenting, [11] as high school children learned new skills and strengthened their understanding of those skills.
Many proponents of inclusive education argue that inclusion outcomes have a positive effect on school students' academic performance.
 Moreover, children with special needs not only do not harm their classmates' academic performance, but also benefit from what they are taught socially, reducing their fear of human differences and increasing their tolerance for understanding others.
  In defectological science, the inseparable connection and interdependence of the child's organic defect with those around him and his communication disorder has been proved, դ the role of the improved communication has been shown in the general correction of children's mental development [1, pp. 223-224].
 In fact, the need for a child with special needs becomes a problem due to the assessment given by the environment և due to the attitude և the more the inclusion starts from the earliest, the inclusion in kindergartens, the more the readiness of the society to accept different needs as a human species.
  This is evidenced by our observations conducted in American schools and kindergartens, which partly determine the relative effectiveness of the inclusion process.
Generalizing the psychological-pedagogical theoretical bases of inclusive education, one can single out the priority and necessity of its implementation in modern society.
 The inclusion of children with special needs will contribute to the enhancement of schoolchildren's academic performance, their facilitation of mental development as a result of joint communication with their peers, the application of universal humanitarian law to create a level playing field for all. .
