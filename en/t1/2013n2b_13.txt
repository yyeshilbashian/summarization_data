One of the main goals of any educational process is to create mental states in students thatwill ensure the development of new "sustainable qualities" and their application in various fields.
  Hovhannes Hindlyan, an Armenian pedagogue, once thought that education would be such that childrengraduate not only armed with the necessary knowledge, but also morally,physically and aesthetically mature, and for that you need schoolbring closer to life. "Keep up with life, realize that you are a nation
It's worth as much as his school, and the student's problem is the studentto do. "
1: The basis of the effectiveness of teaching methods is the active involvement of the learner in the educational activity, when the latter gets the opportunity to express his / her point of view, to defend, debate or supplement with new judgments.
  Perception of informationis an active process, և when it combines emotional impressions and pictorial perceptions from the external environment, the learnerակտիվ shows more active interest in participating in person ևto supplement their knowledge through group activities.
  Հայ:Pedagogue Minasyan wrote. "The purpose of the training is not only that
to give the child acquaintances, knowledge, but to put them togetherin such a way that the child can exercise properly.
 Required:"Every idea should be an acquaintance, a force."
2: Visits to museums are not allowed in this regardonly by displaying values, but by the sensory output of the displayby exchanging impressions.
  In the museum field, science and art have one goal, which is to help people understandthe connection of objects և phenomena, to guide him in a comprehensive cognitiveactivities.
  In this regard, teaching the writer's biography in his or her museum helps the student as much as possibleto achieve the goal.
RA state general education curriculum for pedagogy ևIn particular, it poses new problems for the teaching of the Armenian language and literature, for the development of new approaches to their solution. necessity.
  These approaches are especially relevant to the content requirements of the training, which: The implementation will ensure the unity of different educational spheres, the acquisition of sound knowledge, the development of learners' skills and abilities, the formation of a value system.բացահայտ Discovering creative abilities.
 Armenian in high school Teaching literature, on the one hand, greatly contributes to the acquisition and practical application of language knowledge, on the other hand, becomes An indispensable factor in the comprehensive upbringing of an individual.
 It is one of the conceptual goals of teaching Armenian literature The mental and intellectual development of the individual, for the realization of which it is necessary to make the students aware of the caring heritage of the Armenian people, national and universal ideals and aspirations.
  This: Everything can be done not only by acquainting students with purely literary phenomena, but also by literary heroes, why not him, by the example of our greats, authors - spirit of humanity, high moral qualities - patriotism, patriotism, honor, kindness, moral qualities of a complete and harmonious person. through upbringing.
We will especially emphasize the teaching of Armenian literature is carried out in high school as a history of Armenian literaturea study course, the main content of which can be:to consider the development of Armenian literature, the relations of the writer և period, literary directions և schools study.
Awareness of one of the conceptual provisions, the unique role and significance of the writer in literature, prompted us to reflect on the ArmenianKhachatur Abovyan is unique in the history of the people's caring culture personality, about whom Av. Isahakyan wrote. "He, Abovyan,
is the greatest martyr of our new history with an immortal crown of light decorated.
 He is our new myth, our new national myth, our new MherHe is liberated, unchained. "
3:Kh. Abovyan is an encyclopedist in all respects, the revelation of his image is a precondition for teaching his immortal work.
  Therefore, in order to organize the complex and difficult process of detailed interpretation of the literary-enlightenment activity of Abovyan's life, it is necessary to use all the opportunities available today, widely using all the media - Internet, manuals, documentaries, textbooks, etc.
Let's add that today the lessons that provide the learner's independent educational activity become more interesting, his / her direct և active in the process of acquiring knowledge. with participation when an opportunity arises for the student to watch, to hear, to feel և to perceive.
  And when during the mastering of the materialThe student gets an opportunity to bring together, summarize, reinforce what he has seen and heard, an environment of self-education is created, a striving for self-improvement is formed.
To implement all this, we offer, as an alternative way of organizing training, Kh. To organize the teaching of Abovyan biography in his house-museum.
  Such a lessongives an opportunity to study all of Abovyan's biographycircumstances.
  As a result of teaching different from the traditional classThis horse becomes meaningful, interesting and impressive, which in itselfin turn, contributes to the achievement of the student goal.
Taking advantage of the students' own research skills, the teacher instructs the students to study the topic independently before the visit.Literature (A. Bakunts "Khachatur Abovyan" novel, E. Charents "TowardsLyarn Masis "poem, textbook, Ashot Melkonyan" Ararat. The book "The Mystery of Armenian Immortality" (film, Internet, etc.).
The teacher as a priority in the process of teaching studentsgoal, the following issues should be addressed: Kh. Extensive knowledge about Abovyan's life and patriotic activities, as well as his
as a leading thinker of the time, a teacher, a skilled pedagogue,The character of the writer, the pedagogical work of "History of Tigran", the author of the works "Prelude of Education" կրթ "Children's Draw"devaluation.
  The preparatory work is followed by an educational-cognitive excursion to the writer's birthplace, Kanaker.
The latter with its rich centuries-old past, majestic and beautiful with landscapes, with the majesty of St. Hakob և Astvatsatsin churchescaptures students' attention - cognitive skillsintertwined with subtle և deep emotional perceptions.
On the teacher's instruction, one of the students reads the words of Abovyan dedicated to Zangi. "Call, call, sweeten my call. to you
A fierce battle was seen in my eyes.
  Call,The elite youth of the Haigazian dynasty have seen you terribly. "
4: The patriotic spirit of the writer was born from the generous love thatIt originates from its native place of birth, then completes to Armenia.
 The inspiration of this love is breathed when the children enter the writer's grandfather, Fr. The luxurious family house built by Apov,
where he was born, Khachatur spent the nine years of his childhood Abovyan.
  This house accurately represents the patriarchal Armenian family with its way of life, customs, color, completingThe figurative perception of Abovyan ancestors as elders of the Ararat world.
It must be assumed that as a result of what is seen, the cognitive field is formed in the students, which is very important for the multifaceted perception of the material, for the strengthening of knowledge.
  The children's initial impressions are then supplemented by the comments of the museum staff, which are rich historical evidence asof the period, as well as the origin of Kanaker settlement and its nameabout the traditions associated with it.
  The students are deeply interested in both the references related to the explanation of the name of the ancient settlement and the explanations given by Abovyan.which learners have the opportunity to hear on the spot (They:They record what they see and hear in the form of brief notes in the literature notebook).
Education is a social process that aims at the individualThe resulting interdependence leads to intra-group "dynamic wholeness", leading to the realization of the common goal.
  In terms ofWhat can be learned with the help of an adult or a peer is several times better than learning alone.
  Communication:It is a high, irreplaceable snow of human intellectual development.
  This creates an interactive environment where students individually or express what they know in a group, comparefacts, make generalizations.
 Still German pedagogue I. Herbert noted. "Thoughts come from thoughts, and
of them - principles և actions. "
5:The lesson in the museum gives students the opportunity to understand the complex, controversial events in the Transcaucasia in the 19th century, particularly in Armenia, the policy pursued by powerful tsarist Russia, and then itsThe consequences, which played a decisive role both for the Armenian people and in the life of his famous children, including him in Abovyan.
  Isn't it?Abovyan was in the vortex of that difficult and controversial period.
It would not be wrong to say that one of the requirements for the content of literature teaching is interdisciplinary communication. creation, which is one of the preconditions for the realization of the common educational goal.
 And the rich and rich content of the museummaps of historical events, artcases, as educational material, bring to the final goal providing material by providing a link between history and literature, which:and contributes to the complete assimilation of the material.
  G. in the museumKhanjyan, A. Parsamyan, E. Isabekyan "F. Parrot "," F. Parrot և:
Khachatur Abovyan on the heights of Ararat "," Nerses Ashtaraketsi ", G.Bashinjaghyan's paintings "Apovents House in Winter" leave an unforgettable impression on children.
  And the prominent painter Ludwig vonThe portrait created by Maidel, which is the only portrait of Abovyan, like:the great Schiller, Rousseau, F. Parrot portraits are irreplaceable
are a way to teach a writer biography that they provideThe student's direct contact with art.
And when parallel to the presentation of the facts of the writer's biography?it is used to teach his moral qualities, it is createdIt is an environment of empathy, when the learner feels the writer's inner world, feelings, his goals and ideas become clear to him.
  Finally, the student is even more interested in Abovyanlife events, especially for studentswho are usually inattentive or unwilling to attend classeslessons.
In our opinion, a lesson organized in Abovyan House-Museum Due to the complete presentation and mastering of the topic, because:teaching technologies that are characterized by planned outcomes when the educator is required to provide students with educational Planned indicators of the content of the material, such as the writerThe period lived, the most important historical events, the material evidence of the writer կյանքի կյանքի's life and activity, then the students, as a result of the cognitive activity, receive a combined cognitive material, due to which they first understand the capacious material; then they can apply what they have learned at that moment under certain conditions.
 In this case, the learners can apply all this in the next lesson, during the teaching of the topic "Circumstances of the creation of the novel" Wound of Armenia "in Abovyan".
The teaching of Abovyan's biography in the writer's house-museum is valued by the fact that school tours and excursions are of great importance both physically and mentally.from the point of view of aesthetic education.
  In his time he was greatEnlightener Abovyan gave a great place to school excursions in pedagogy, substantiating their educational role.
According to Abovyan, the precondition for effective և smart teaching is "visibility, simplicity ությունը justification during teaching ...The transition from the known to the unknown, from practice to theory, from the spiritual world to the abstract ... the comparison of the unknown with the familiar,to understand, to repeat often what we are going through ... the relevance of the subjects in adolescence to the understandings ... ”.
