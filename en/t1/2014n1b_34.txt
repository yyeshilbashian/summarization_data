The issue of teaching the grammar of the mother tongue in the elementary grades has always been a subject of debate for a long time, linguist-methodologists have expressed contradictory opinions.
 For example, J. Aghayan, criticizing N. Ter-Gondyan's textbook "The Element of Grammar of the Mother Tongue" (1883) opposes teaching grammar in elementary grades, saying: "Grammar in elementary school will become a barrier, a bee hive, a barrier, an obstacle to the natural and regular development of the language" [3, p. 193].
 And the great Armenian linguist M. Abeghyan said. "Of course, the student understands both the forms of his mother tongue and that meaning without grammar, but he understands a kind of instinctively, mixed, separate, and the teaching of grammar makes the understanding of the linguistic forms of the mother tongue and their meaning from instinctive to conscious, mixed knowledge. , complete and generalized ”[1, p. 59].
  The great Russian pedagogue KD Ushinsky expressed about the same opinion. "... the lack of grammar deprives the ability to speak ականconsciousness թող leaves children in a shaky state…" [12, p. 349].
 The famous Armenian grammar scholar Palasanyan, speaking about the place, role and proportion of the works carried out in the direction of grammar, living language teaching, said. "From the very beginning, they cannot be carried out at the same time. The teaching of living language must precede the teaching of grammar in order to create the necessary linguistic basis for its comprehension, as living language is the only firm foundation on which the building of regular upbringing must be built." Palasanyan, Grammar on the Mother Tongue, A., B., G., 5th type, Tbilissi (Georgia), 1906, page E].
The elementary course of the mother tongue is divided into two sections: language pre-knowledge ական elementary language knowledge.
And let's pass the pre-knowledge, the basic language knowledge in a combined way, together with reading.
 It is appropriate to notice Prof.A.E. Ter-Grigoryan, saying. "When taking grammar materials, the elementary course of the mother tongue takes into account the abilities and comprehension abilities of the students, their linguistic resources, the practical value of the materials to be taught" [11, p. 317].
  And the great linguist-methodologist Ar. Bahatryan believed that in elementary school "grammar should not be the goal of teaching, but it և should be only a means to an end, that is, a means to understand the literary language accurately, to master it" [Ar. Bahatryan, Grammar of Secular Language (Instead of Preface), "Pedagogical Newspaper", 1878, No. 4, p. 56].
This is what the authors of the existing textbooks in the mother tongue meant, who created a unified textbook of reading, grammar, reading and grammar material, which made it possible to make language learning more effective and purposeful.
 In this case, instead of memorizing the grammar rules, the children apply the linguistic patterns in their speech, as a result of which they develop their thinking, judgment skills, which is the goal of "grammar".
Now let's see how the basic language knowledge is distributed in the native language programs, what response they found in the textbooks.
In these combined textbooks (6,7, 8, 9, 10, 13) the program requirements of "reading skills" and "basic knowledge" of basic knowledge are especially used.
Still in the first grade, students study the Armenian phonetic alphabet (alphabet), distinguish phonetic և consonants, get acquainted with their spelling to some extent, which is strengthened in the following grades.
To this must be added what has been said in the alphabetical part about the spelling of uppercase letters;
The current textbooks for the second grade (9, 13) are compiled on the principle of thematic grouping, which includes materials appropriate to the worldview of primary school students;
 If necessary, the lessons can be moved, provided that the logical sequence of the linguistic material is not violated.
 In this class there is a repetition, strengthening and teaching of phonetics, orthography, orthography.
  Teaching word spelling, in practice, simple, complex, derivative words րանց their spelling.
Repetition, reinforcement and teaching of personal, special and common names, synonyms, antonyms.
  Reinforcement of sentences, sentences with different structure (subject, attribute, action words) ումը teaching.
The new textbooks of the native language (6, 10) have been in use in the 3rd grade of the secondary schools of the Republic of Armenia since 2008, as well as the first assistants of the teachers teaching with those textbooks, methodological guides, which have a guiding role in the teacher's daily creative work.
In the third grade they pass: 1. spelling.
  One of the key issues of the native language course is the teaching of orthography.
 In the third grade, the words related to the previous grammatical and phonetic orthography should be repeated with a significant increase.
 The orthography of double consonants must be changed from phonetic orthography.
 In this class, the list of words that differ in pronunciation with "this writing" should be added, provided that their spelling is taught in a practical way, with frequent repetition and nomination in small groups of words.
2. Psychology.
  3. Syntax.
  In order to give a general understanding of the parts of the word, it is decided why the word can be used, what position it can have in the sentence, in what constructive field it may be needed.
 The fact that a word is part of a word is also called a grammatical value, so to determine parts of a word means to determine the grammatical value of words.
  To determine the grammatical value of a word, it is necessary to know the grammatical features of the word, that is, what category of concepts it expresses, what grammatical features it has, what syntactic positions it can perform.
 For this purpose, first the words are grouped according to the parts of the word, that is, according to the main meaning expressed by them, then the morphological and finally the syntactic features of each are studied.
Fourth grade textbooks with their content (7, 8) were able to provide combined teaching of mother tongue և reading, using reading texts.
 This class includes orthography, word composition, word meaning, literal և figurative meanings, word combination and phrase repetition ումը teaching.
 Repetition of nouns, adjectives, verbs, their modifications (without using the terms "conjugation" և "bow"), learning the name, pronoun.
Types of sentences by composition. Teaching simple և complex, according to the purpose of communication (or tone), the use of exclamation marks, accents, hyphens, exclamation marks և question marks.
Let us present an example of a summary lesson of language knowledge.
Topic of the lesson - "Applying the knowledge of the parts of speech in practical works".
Collaborative lesson Objective - 1. Will be able to put into practice their previously acquired knowledge and skills about parts of speech.
2. The ability to organize collaborative work will be developed.
3. The ability to develop a design ելու step-by-step design will be developed.
Learning materials - Images representing objects, legos, the portrait of the ancestor Hayk, doll Seth, a tree made of cardboard, fruits, on which words, baskets are written.
The class is divided into four groups.
 Each group represents a part of a word: noun, adjective, verb, year.
Task 1. Game: "Harvest" Fruits are hung on the tree, on which words are written.
One student from each group approaches the tree and collects the words that represent the corresponding part of the word.
After the "harvest", everyone takes the words out of their basket, presents the grammatical features.
Task 2. Group I - nouns - will make a collage, Group II - but - will present a pantomime, Group III - adjectives - will give typical adjectives to the portrait, Group IV - will build a "high-rise building" with legos with a certain number of animals.
Game: Let's help "Pnti Set".
Task 3. Question: "Who came to visit us?"
 After guessing the children, we will show the puppet with a smoky face and clothes to Pnti Seth և we will ask for their help.
 They will say words and phrases that will help Setin become a clean boy.
  For example, a group of nouns - soap, water, iron, clothes, brush, paste.
Verb group - to wash, comb, bathe, dress, iron.
Adjective group - dirty, clumsy, clean, neat, beautiful.
Date group - one brush, three buckets of water, two soaps, two towels.
Task 4. Solve a crossword puzzle, the questions of which are of grammatical nature.
1. How do we determine the face of a verb?
2. How do they say the subject in another way?
3. The name given to all objects of the same type is called… 4. The suffix of the word "landing".
5. The phonetic change of the word "page" / mark the letter /.
6. What is the simple word made of?
7. Part of speech.
8. Auxiliary verb with the second person.
9. Year.
10. Noun - a unit of time.
Crossword puzzle in 6 minutes. Task 5. We will show a letter-petition sent by the nouns and adjectives. As a result, we will turn nouns and adjectives into verbs.
Each of them will present a self-made book about the use of parts of speech and their features.
The groups will be reasonedly evaluated using the pre-presented group work evaluation criteria scale.
Conclusion. In elementary grades, language material should not be the goal of the lesson, but it should be only a means to an end, that is, a means to understand literary language accurately, to construct a syntactically correct, connected, fluent word.
This is what the authors of the existing textbooks in the mother tongue meant, who created a unified textbook for reading, language material, reading and language teaching, which made it possible to make language teaching more effective and purposeful.
  In this case, instead of memorizing the grammar rules, the children apply the linguistic patterns in their speech, as a result of which they develop their thinking, judgment skills, which is the goal of "grammar".
