Most of the plant names preserved in the Syunik-Artsakh dialect area are found in ancient Armenian, and some of them have similarities with Indo-European languages.
While undergoing various changes over time, the dialect group has retained words և word meanings that provide partial or complete information about the historical development of words.
Simultaneous և periodic study of dialect data makes an etymological experiment around grain words.
  We think that the stock of literary language alone is not enough to conduct a thorough word examination.
  Therefore, a complete examination of the semantic expressions of the word preserved in the dialect group, as well as the comparison of the bibliographic information with other languages ​​can be useful for the etymology of the other nouns begging for the word և in the sense և և ար ար ար հաճ ար ար հաճ հաճ հաճ.

There are no other bibliographic data, there is no evidence from the originals in the orabaric dictionaries [13, 444] [definite words that have a phonetic composition և meaning with the word that has beggars.
  For example, N. Hovhannisyan in XII-XVII centuries. He singled out the word tsireal from the handwritten dictionaries. «Ծիւրեալ.ծմրեալ. ծγγ / կեալ. oppressed. worn out. հիւծեալ. account քամեալ. նուաւղ / զ (ել) », which we can not generalize in advance with the word under examination [11,36].
  And here is the XVIII century. In the handwritten dictionary of identifiers, the question posed in the article "in the Karabakh dialect, in the sense of" tearing ", the question posed in the article," in the dialect of Karabakh, in the sense of 'tear', in the dialect, in the dialect, the meanings used in the dialect " 34-35], with the presence of dialect data. ծիվ [ւ] -ծիվ [ւ] անէլ (Շին. և այլուր) ||: sprout-sprout, but with the meaning of twitch-twist the syntactic versions are practical (possibly dialectal versions of the word tsivil).
  In their sense, the word "beg" is used in the sense of begging, it is used with the meanings "to cut a piece of wood, a stone, to cut it", which is also indicated by A. In the dictionary compiled by Margaryan, tsghgan "ax-layered wood - chhon" (Art. Na - "grass dry, hard"), tsghanel "cut the wood, make chhon" [14, 406].
 In my dialect, the words ghghel և ghghel գրեթե are used in almost the same sense, cf. Ճghats or Tsghatskar, the well-known inscription of Tat's canal (you can see about this [24, 227]].
"To tear Gorisimas to pieces" "to tear, to tear apart" The first attempt to explain the word is found in A. Bagratuni's translation of Vergilios ("Cultivation"): "to sow wheat's ash, which is grain" [22, 15]: "Ashtip" (pronounced ashtuch "dry bread"), that H. Acharyan considers it "wordless" [2, 222].
  Grain is also found in translation works || grain that corresponds to the English Groat (pronounced groats "grain") "1. a weight equal to one or half a barley, 2. clover, grain ”[15, 321].

  In one of the explanations of the word "Erkanq" we find: "a pair of hard stones, flat and all-stone stones, used to make vikmantr" [17, 120]
2. Dialect և foreign data.
  Grain is common in Armenian dialects: “1. husked wheat, 2. milled barley of cows ”[9, 320].
  There is useful information in the "Provincial" section of the WBU. From this they made grain to "gossip, gossip", to gather grain "to gossip", to grind grain to "gossip", to grind "to dream", to grind "to speak big" [2, 147].
These last letters are also given in the "Armenian Provincial Dictionary", the use of which is included in Yer's dialect.
  In the same place, to "magnify" is given with a question mark: [?].
  It is also referred to as "wheat of wheat", "a kind of thin and thin wheat" used in Artsakh [1, 681].
  In the Ararat dialect, the metaphorical uses of the word "beaten wheat" have made grain "to gossip", to gather grain from each other "to quarrel unnecessarily with each other" [16,69].
  We find the explanation of the dialect word at the end of the 19th century. "Boiled grain (Persian-Armenians call it corn) is also made from wheat" [8, 200].
  Gorisumtsar is said to be a type of wheat, hence the word "tsar" to mean "What are you doing in Tsivar?", "To arten in Tsivar, what are you doing?"
  It has the same name as the word to hide. "Green in Aparoshidme, / In the snout of a snake. / The soul of Alpaslan will crown you (" (D. Varuzhan, "The Massacre", D.).
"To gossip, the word is useless" (it is mentioned, Persian borrowing) The word "dzavar" is synonymous with "korkot", "ashtip" [21, 677].
  The latter is widespread in the Middle East [25,27-37] (the similarities with the Persian word ĵou / وج / do not specify linguistic affiliation), but also in Armenian, which is probably among the Turkish borrowings, not mentioning the borrower և intermediary languages ​​b /, Arabic. bārğul / لغر ب /, Turkish. bulgur ||: bulğur, ქართული. burghuli / ბურღული / և etc.
  Syunik-Artsakh dialect group is a new word.
  In today's life, grain is called "boiled" and "bulked" wheat is called "boiled, broken or ground".
  H. We think that Acharyan's word "* pllortel" [1, 912], which testified in Artsakh, "gathering piles of clouds to make it rain", was formed not from the meaning of the word mulberry, "ripe grape mulberry puree", but pirto gh || պլտօ ղ ||: պուլտօ ղ ||: purto gh = from the composition in the military sense of turbidity.
"Annual", recent testimonies of the Armenian language in Goris ունեցած The petitions with the Persian language suggest that the word "grain" is an old dialect borrowing that has retained the non-private meaning - "grain, grain".
  But it is more probable that it is a general word for the peoples of the region, hmmt. Kurdish savar "grain (also a dish [23, 531]), mound", Turkish. çavdar (Turkish: çavdar means "rye, annual", but H. Acharyan distinguishes Turkish from the press: dialectal words: Mes. T. et al., zavar "grain" [2, 148]), or "mound" , ქართული. avivavi (s) "hachar".
  In the latter connection it is also used with the meanings "to gossip, to lengthen the speech" - to do in a hurry, in Artsakh in parallel with this - to shave / do in a hurry, the meaning is expressed by the harsh word composition - to hurry "to speak quickly" [20, 245].
It should be noted that the word grain in Goris is mostly perceived as "grain, wheat" (wheat is mostly used in Artsakh [8, 488]), but "grain" with a separate use in different formations.
  The meaning of the word "wheat" is synonymous with the word "broken grain, grain given to animals" (it is also used in Artsakh || it is "grain, kut" (<danā / ه ناد / " seed, 3. seed, 4. drop, 5. flake, 6. grain »).
We think that the Syunik-Artsakh dialect group || "the word" beans "," but the grain of barley, the barley pods are grained, the grains ripen ", is from that very root).
  An old prayer, a word of worship has been preserved. "Jeta, note, the grain is dry, there is a lump, the leaves are like the leaves, the grain is like a bulb, it burns like a goat."
  Barley, wheat այլ cereals are not used under other plant names.
note the questions.
Յ. Pokornin3. Genealogical questions.
  Coming to the question of the origin of the word, let us note that, nevertheless, in etymological, word-analysis works the "grain" of the root Jimast is not specified, [27, 512], without the Armenian version, in particular, "barley" evidence.
  H. Acharyan essentially leaves the origin of the word in suspense, presents the interpretations of others, in which the root is begged with the word wheat - sansk. yava, պրսկ. ĵav "barley", Greek. ζειά "wheat" [etc. [2, 147].
  Գ. Jahukyan does not refer to the word grain in the "History of the Armenian language", but in the Armenian SSR he considers it to be "poor". origin: «* iuo-: * ieuo-« grain, barley, millet, Lithuanian from the javai "grain" base, with the prefix * i> * j> d crossing [19, 474].
e-district agriculture4. Conclusions.
  Considering the similarities of the words found in the Armenian dialects with the Indo-European languages, it is more probable that the most frequently used names in the Syunik-Artsakh dialect area are preserved:
We think that one of those words is Korkot (synonymous in Kapan, Meghri, which is mostly found in Kapan, Meghri), meaning "beaten or minced wheat or barley", in Syunik-Artsakh, Kurkut. Indo-European origin. «G2rod- from the root, which repeatedly gave enakhinchpeskarkut <* kakrut <hnkh. g2ag2rōdo- »[2, 650].
 Գ. Jahukyan also considers H.K. origin: * gogrod- * gred- from the root "scratch, grate" [19, 424].
 H. Acharyan presented in detail the meaningful beggars of the word korkot in the related languages, with other meanings "grain, korkot" 2 [2, 650].
Transferred to H. Acharyan probably considers * coarse-coarse, Referring to grain || According to the data in the written-dialect sources of the word "grain", we notice that its secondary meaning - to grind, to grind "to grind, to grind", in Syunik - to grind, to grind, to "grind, to lengthen", was primary, from which The meaning of "ground grain" was formed, which later became the main meaning.
  By the way, that same application has to be crocheted || to "gossip", but to "peel the grain, make grain".
  We think that the meaning of "grain, a kind of wheat" should be taken as a starting point for the examination of the word grain, of which, in Syunik, a thin-reddish type of wheat has been preserved.
  The same is true for the word "korkot" - korkot or kurkut <kot-kot "grain-grain", with repentance - korkot || կուրկուտ.
The semantic examination allows us to be inclined to the opinion that the words grain և korkot, respectively tsar, kurkut, have Indo-European appeals.
  The word grain was spread in the Armenian versions in the sense of "generalized plant grain". (cf. Persian: çavdar / radwach / "ashora, annual" [2, 15]).
  Ս. The meanings of the word hajar (-ohol.) Found in the book also refer to a specific type of wheat: "And the wheat and the chaff were not eaten, for they were tin" (Exodus 932), "and, behold, there was a loaf of bread and a pitcher of water out of it" ), "Korean and lentils within its borders" (Isa 2825), "Lentils and peas and Korean and lentils" (Ezek 49), that G. Jahukyan considers it "incomplete Indo-European - * ades / * ados-" beech ", from the root * ad- with * -io- suffix" [19, 440], which passed to the Caucasian horses.
(H <y) growth-ar: * i eu o-) There is a problem with G. On the passage of * i »* ĵ> d [19, 474] proposed by Jahukyan.
* ad-io-, և ձաւ-ար: * iuo- (* ieuo We suggest to look at the question with the adjective * ad- root * da- ձ> ձա, which later developed independently, turning from word versions into separate semantic words.
  Later the grain was subjected to -i-aholovma, which possibly resulted in the non-syllabic [18, 117] phonetic connection: dzavar * * ad-io - / * aud-io (Latin: ador "hachar"). We have taken the Latin parallel from G. Jahukyan [19, 440]) = brb. tsivari || tsivari || tsavari.
      It can be considered solved as well. * dh (> ճ)> * gh (ձ> ծ) switching issue. հմթ. ՝ աղանձ, խինդ, (խնծիղ || խնձիղ) և այլ [3, 538].
Thus, (h) aghar, "a small type of wheat", is derived from the meaning of the word grain, "crushed wheat or barley" (there are different opinions on the word formation of barley.
 Մ. Fasmer և others put "* аŋk-" under the meaning of "bend, bend" [29, 571-572]) - crooked, and in the Syunik-Artsakh dialect area the original meaning - "a kind of wheat" has been preserved. getreide "grain", getreideart "grain", Goth. atisk (* ades-ko-) "sowing, sowing of grain", hmt. malt և grain և etc. that all originate h.e. * ades- or * ados- [27, 45] from the root "grain".
