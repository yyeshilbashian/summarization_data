1. Introduction.
 Solving algebraic or transcendental equations is one of the most important parts of applied analysis, which is of great importance in the study of various problems in physics, mechanics, science, technology, and the humanities.
In many cases, it is necessary to approximate the algebraic or transcendental equations.
 It should be noted that methods are currently being developed to obtain approximate solutions to these equations with some accuracy.
Due to the fact that the implementation of approximate methods for solving algebraic or transcendental equations requires large-scale calculations, the use of a computer becomes mandatory when considering such problems.
  This requires mastery of modern programming languages, programming of problem algorithms (and building blockchains) դրա computer implementation.
This methodological work describes in detail the method of sequential approximations for determining the roots of algebraic ենդ transcendental equations.
 A program blockchain was developed for that algorithm.
  Specific examples show the application of developed algorithms նրանց their implementation through programs (blockchains) on a computer.
The paper clearly considers the practical issues necessary for the use of currently widely used mathematical software packages (Mathematica, MathCad, Matlab, Maple, Exel, etc.) for practical calculations.
2. Solving algebraic or transcendental equations
the method of sequential approximations (iteration).
Suppose we give an equation where 𝑓 (𝑥) is a continuous function of some [𝑎, 𝑏] segment.
 Equation (1) can easily be replaced by an equal equation where φ (x) is a continuous function of the same [a, b] segment.
How can we choose a արժեք0 value of x, considering that it is close to the root ξ of equation (2) in one way or another, տեղադր place that 𝑥0 value to the right of equation (2).
 In that case we will get the number և1 յ Now put the value 𝑥1 to the right of (2), we will get a new number 𝑥2Continue this process.
 In the nth step we get If the obtained sequence 𝑥 1, 𝑥2,…, 𝑥𝑛, լինի is parallel, that is, there exists a limit value for it, in that case, (5) crossing the boundary in equation, when 𝑛 → ∞, we will have is related to the continuity of the function φ (x).
 And so we will have that is, the limit value of the constructed sequence 𝑥1, 𝑥2,…, 𝑥𝑛, ՝ (6) is the root of equation.
All we have to do is put conditions on the continuous function φ (x) such that the constructed sequence 𝑥1, 𝑥2,…, 𝑥𝑛, լինի is parallel.
  Exactly the following theorem. Theorem.
  Suppose the function φ (x) is a definite և differential (derivative) function on the segment [𝑎, 𝑏], and the values ​​of the function φ (x) are 𝜑 (𝑥) ∈ [𝑎, 𝑏].
 If there exists a positive q value less than one (q <1) such that | ′ ′ (𝑥) | ≤ 𝑞 <1, when 𝑎 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 𝑏, then 1. The process 𝑥𝑛 = 𝜑 (𝑥𝑛 − 1) (𝑛 = 1,2, պր), regardless of the choice of the initial value 𝑥0 ∈ [𝑎, 𝑏], coincides, (սահման) the limit value will be the only root of equation (2) [𝑎, 𝑏] On.
Proof.
  Consider two consecutive members of the constructed sequence 𝑥𝑛 + 1 𝑥𝑛 𝑥𝑛, we will have կունեն = 𝜑 (− − 1) և 𝑥𝑛 + 1 = 𝜑 (𝑥𝑛) From here we can write 𝑥𝑛 + 1 - 𝑥𝑛 = 𝜑 (𝑥𝑛) - 𝜑 (𝑥𝑛 − 1 ).
For the difference to the right of this relation, use Langrange's finite growth formula, we get, ∈ (− − 1, 𝑥𝑛).
Using the condition of the theorem (9), we can get the following inequality from (11): Now here we give n the values ​​n = 1,2,3,…, we have Consider the following series, for which (n + 1) The sum will be: (13) by the power of inequalities, (14) the members of the series are absolutely smaller than the corresponding members of the series of the nature of geometric progression, where the denominator is 0 <q <1, hence the power of the known theorem of analysis (14) is absolute.
 Therefore, if we cross the boundary, we will have lim in the equation (15)
𝑆𝑛 + 1 exists է is finite, then և𝑥𝑛 there exists a limit և𝑥𝑛 which is finite.
If we denote that limit : 𝑥𝑛 = , where  ∈ [a, b], (17) then crossing one of the equations in one of the 10 (10) equations, when we get n → ((see (6) - (8)) that is  ՝ is the root of the equation (2).
(2) Equation has no other root in [[, 𝑏].
Indeed, suppose that , different from ՝, էլ is also a numeral of equation (2), which belongs to [𝑎, 𝑏], that is, in which case we can write - φ ().
Using Langrange's finite growth formula, we get Where c∈ [, ̅].
 Since according to the theorem condition, [1-𝜑 ′ (𝑐)] is not equal to zero (| (𝜑 ′ (𝑐) | ≤ 𝑞 <1), then ̅–  = 0, ie այսինքն = ̅, and this It also means that the root we have found is the only one.
Remark 1.
  If the interval (𝑎, 𝑏) is (-∞, + ∞) is an integer, then the theorem is also true ճիշտ in this case, if the condition of theorem (9) is true x∈
For (−∞, + ∞).
Remark 2.
  As we have seen, the sequence ով} կառուց constructed on the iteration principle coincides with any choice of 𝑥0.
Let us now estimate the approximation 𝑛.
 We can have | 𝑥1 - 𝑥0 |
If we cross the border in this inequality, when p → ∞, we will finally get | x1 - x0 |.
As we can see from the obtained estimate, the smaller q is, the faster the iteration process will approach its limit value.
The algorithm for the sequential approximation method for determining the root of the equation 𝑥 = 𝜑 (𝑥) in the Mathlab environment program is shown below, and the block diagram is shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1.Example 1.
  Find the real root of the following equation: 𝑥 - 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑥 = 0.25 with accuracy 𝜀 = 10−4.
Solution.
 By rough estimation or graphical method we can get the approximate value of the root of the equation: x0 = 1.2, and it is obvious that  <x0.
 The given equation can be written as follows: Taking as the main range (1.1; 1.3), (which is substantiated graphically) by denoting we will have: | 𝜑 ′ (𝑥) | 𝑐𝑜𝑠 𝑐𝑜𝑠520 ≈ 0.62 = 𝑞 <1.
We can writeElecting x0 = 1.2 և giving ըստ = 10−4 according to the condition of the problem, build xn
successive approximations until the difference of two hundred xn − 1 և xn approximations satisfies that accuracy.
We will get: 𝑥8 = 𝑠𝑖𝑛1.1712 + 0.25 = 0.9212 + 0.25 = 1.1712.
As we can see, the value of the root with this accuracy is: If we enter the corresponding data of this equation in the Now brought program, we will get: Example 2.
 Find the largest positive root of the following equation 𝑥3 + 𝑥 = 1000 with accuracy 𝜀 = 10−4.
Solution.
 With a rough estimate we can get the approximate value of the root of the equation: x0 = 10, and it is obvious that  <x0.
 We can write the given equation as follows: by will.
Taking as the main range (9,10) և denoting = 𝑞 <1.
In this example we can write.
 If we enter the relevant data of the equation, we will get: 3. Using a computer Mathcad system.
The use of computer mathematics systems in the problem of approximate determination of the roots of algebraic ենդ transcendental equations makes it possible to automate the complex calculations of mathematical calculations, as a result of which one can significantly gain in terms of time spent.
 It is also very effective to use the graphical capabilities of these systems.
   Below we will take the steps required to use the MathCad computer system (see [6] in this regard).
 To do this, use the root function of MathCad.
For example.
 Find the root of the equation 𝑥 - 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑥 = 0,25 with the necessary accuracy using the root function.
         In this case you have to dial with the help of the keyboard (see Figure 2): We take the accuracy of the calculation from the corresponding scale (𝜀 =
10−4).
 By adding the sign "=", we get the value of the root:  = 1.1712.
