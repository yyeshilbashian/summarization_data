1. Introduction.
 Solving algebraic or transcendental equations is one of the most important parts of applied analysis.It is of great importance in the study of various problems in physics, mechanics, natural sciences, technology, and the humanities.
In many cases, it is necessary to approximate the algebraic or transcendental equations.
 It should be notedthat methods are currently being developed that can be obtainedApproximate solutions of these equations with some accuracy.
Depending on whether algebraic or transcendentalrequires the implementation of approximate methods for solving the equationHuge calculations, so when using such problems, the use of a computer becomes mandatory.
  This requires mastering modern programming languages, programming problem algorithms (and building blockchains) with a computer.implementation.
This methodological work describes in detail the method of sequential approximations for determining the roots of algebraic ենդ transcendental equations.
 A program has been developed for this algorithmwith its block diagram.
  Specific examples show the application of developed algorithms նրանց their implementation through programs (blockchains) on a computer.
The paper clearly considers the practical issues necessary for the use of currently widely used mathematical software packages (Mathematica, MathCad, Matlab, Maple, Exel, etc.) for practical calculations.
2. Solving algebraic or transcendental equations
the method of sequential approximations (iteration).
Let's say it is givenequation where 𝑓 (𝑥) is a continuous function of some [𝑎, 𝑏] segmenton.
 Equation (1) can easily be replaced by its equivalent in the equation where φ (x) is a continuous function of the same [a, b] segmenton.
How do we choose a արժեք0 value of x, considering it to be this or that?is close to the root ξ of equation (2), let's put that value տեղադր0(2) to the right of the equation.
 In that case we will get the number 𝑥1Now put the value 𝑥1 to the right of (2), we will get a new number 𝑥2Let's continue this process.
 In the nth step we will get If the resulting sequence 𝑥 1, 𝑥2,…, 𝑥𝑛, լինի is parallel,that is, there must be a limit value for it:in that case, (5) crossing the boundary in equality when 𝑛 → ∞, we will haveThe representation here on the right is related to the continuity of the function φ (x).
 And so we will haveThat is, the boundary of the constructed sequence 𝑥1, 𝑥2,…, 𝑥𝑛,:The value of (6) is the root of equation.
All we have to do is put conditions on φ (x) on a continuous function such thatthat the constructed sequences 𝑥1, 𝑥2,…, 𝑥𝑛,… are parallel.
  That's rightthe following theorem.Theorem.
  Let the function φ (x) be defined և differential (derivative) is a function on the segment [𝑎, 𝑏], where the values ​​of the function φ (x) are: 𝜑 (𝑥) ∈ [𝑎, 𝑏].
 If there is such a positive q value as less than one (q <1),such that:| 𝜑 ′ (𝑥) |: 𝑞 𝑞 <1, when 𝑎 ≤ 𝑥 𝑏 𝑏,
then:1. 𝑥𝑛 = 𝜑 (𝑥𝑛 − 1) (𝑛 = 1,2,…) process, regardless of 𝑥0 ∈ [𝑎, 𝑏] initialfrom the choice of value, converges,(𝑥𝑛) will be the limit value (2)the only root of the equation on [𝑎, 𝑏].
Proof.
  Consider each other in a constructed sequenceWe will have two next members, 𝑥𝑛 + 1 և և𝑥𝑛 = 𝜑 (− − 1) և 𝑥𝑛 + 1 = 𝜑 (𝑥𝑛)We can write from here𝑥𝑛 + 1 - 𝑥𝑛 = 𝜑 (𝑥𝑛) - 𝜑 (𝑥𝑛 − 1).
Apply for the difference to the right of this relationWe will get the final Langrange growth formulawhere:∈ ∈ (𝑥𝑛 − 1, 𝑥𝑛).
Using the condition of the theorem (9), we can get from (11)the following inequality: Now if we give n values ​​here, we will have n = 1,2,3,:Consider the following series:for which (n + 1) the private sum will be:(13) by the power of the inequalities, (14) the members of the series are absolutely smaller than the corresponding members of the series of the nature of the geometric progression, where the denominator is 0 <q <1, hence the known analysisBy the power of the theorem (14) the series coincides, and it is absolute.
 Therefore, if:If we cross the border, we will have (15) in equalitywhere lim:
𝑆𝑛 + 1 exists է is finite, then և exists և𝑥𝑛 the boundary, which is finite.
If we set that limit :𝑥𝑛 = , where  ∈ [a, b], (17)then in one of the equations (10) crossing the boundary when n → ∞we will get (see (6) - (8))that is, ՝ is the root of the equation (2).
(2) Equation has no other root in [[, 𝑏].
Indeed, suppose that տարբեր is different from համար for equation (2)is a root that belongs to [𝑎, 𝑏], ieIn that case we can write̅–  = φ (̅) - φ ().
Applying Langrange's final growth formula, we get:Where c∈ [, ̅].
 Because according to the theorem, [1-𝜑 ′ (𝑐)] is not equalzero (| (𝜑 ′ (𝑐) | ≤ 𝑞 <1), so ̅–  = 0, ie ՝ = , and this meansis that the  root we found is the only one.
Remark 1.
  If (𝑎, 𝑏) the interval (-∞, + ∞) is an integer,then the theorem is also true in this case if the condition of theorem (9) is true x∈
For (−∞, + ∞).
Remark 2.
  As we have seen, the iterative sequence {𝑥𝑛 ում coincides with any choice of 𝑥0In this case.
Let us now estimate the approximation 𝑛.
 We can writewhere will we have? | 𝑥1 - 𝑥0 |.
If we cross the boundary in this inequality when p → ∞, then:we will finally get| x1 - x0 |.
As we can see from the estimate, the smaller q,the faster the iteration process will approach its limit value.
The algorithm of the method of sequential approximations for determining the root of the equation 𝑥 = 𝜑 (𝑥) is given inand the block diagram is shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1.Example 1.
  Find the following equation: 𝑥 - 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑥 = 0.25 real the root 𝜀 = 10−4 accuracy.
Solution.
 By rough estimation or graphic method we canget the approximate value of the root of the equation: x0 = 1.2, moreoverIt is obvious that  <x0.
 We can write the given equation as follows:Taking as the main range (1.1; 1.3), which is justifiedgraphically) և assigning we will have:| 𝜑 ′ (𝑥) |: 𝑐𝑜𝑠 𝑐𝑜𝑠520 ≈ 0.62 = 𝑞 <1.
We can writeChoosing x0 = 1.2 և giving խնդ = 10−4 according to the condition of the problem, let us construct xn
successive approximations until two hundred xn − 1 և xnThe difference in approximations will satisfy that accuracy.
We will get:𝑥8 = 𝑠𝑖𝑛1.1712 + 0.25 = 0.9212 + 0.25 = 1.1712.
As we can see, the exact value of the root is:In the current program, enter according to this equationdata:we will get:Example 2.
 Find the largest positive root of the following equation 𝑥3 + 𝑥 = 1000 with accuracy 𝜀 = 10−4.
Solution.
 With a rough estimate we can get the approximate value of the root of the equation: x0 = 10, and it is obvious that  <x0.
 We can write the given equation as follows:or:in the form of:
Taking as the main range (9,10) և assigningwe will have:= 𝑞 <1.
In this example we can write:.
 If we enter the relevant data of the equation:then we get:3. Use of computer Mathcad system.
Computational ենդ Transcendental Equation Roots for Problems in Computer Mathematics Systemsuse allows for mathematical calculationsto automate the arduous calculations, as a result of which one can significantly gain in terms of spending time.
 This is very effectivethe use of graphical capabilities of systems.
   Here are some steps you can take to begin the process of preparation for mediation (see MathCad)his work [6]).
 To do this, use the root function of MathCad.
For example.
 Find the root of the equation 𝑥 - 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑥 = 0,25 with the necessary accuracy using the root function.
         In this case you need to type using the keyboard (see Figure 2):We take the accuracy of the calculation from the corresponding scale (𝜀 =:
10−4).
 By adding the sign "=", we get the value of the root:  = 1.1712.
