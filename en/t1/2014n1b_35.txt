Syntax is the part of syntax that studies the position of sentence members relative to each other.
  In order to form a sentence, you need a footnote, a certain tone and a certain arrangement of words.
  The order of arrangement of sentence units is called syntax. ”
 [4, p. 263] The topic of "Syntax" is not a subject of special study in the syntax course of the general education school.
The composition depends on the content of the sentence, the structure, the load, the meeting of the parts of the speech, the spelling, the composition of the footnote, etc.
Considering that the change in the syntax of a sentence is conditioned by a logical stress, և these are mutually related, so we teach the topics of "Syntax" ադաս "Logical stress" together.
We give an idea of ​​the rotation of the sentence members by drawing the students' attention to the sentences written on the board.
1) After breakfast, Varduhi joins a group of women and girls. She goes to the seaside to take a bath.
2) Nan, Zani, Mikich, Moss were waiting outside the village 3 / HT / 3) The air was filled with the scent of variegated flowers.
4) It was a song like the sun, burning with the evening fire (NO).
After discussing the mentioned sentences, the students find out that the words in the sentence follow each other in a certain order.
  This accepted order of arrangement is called syntax.
The Armenian language has its own rules of syntax.
 It is usually subjunctive before the footnote  in 1, 3 sentences, the addition before the addition, and the revealer after the revelation.
 But this is a petrified law, սովորական sometimes the usual order of word arrangement in a word changes in 2, 4  without affecting the content.
 For example, if we change the places of the members of the 3rd sentence, the content will not change. "The air was filled with the scent of colorful flowers."
 "The air was filled with the scent of colorful flowers."
 "The air was filled with the scent of colorful flowers."
 These changes will result in stylistic versions.
So, the syntax is of two types: straight "ordinary" րջ rotating.
In a direct syntax, the subject հատ determiner և determiner is preceded by the subject, the subject is followed by the time, the causes, followed by the footnote, and then the place, purpose items.
  This is the usual syntax.
  In case of violating this order, if any member is moved forward or backward, we will get a tour.
  Writers use this to create multiple variables of the same sentence for stylistic reasons.
 "Depending on the mastery of the writer who makes a turn, the inverted sentence is endowed with emotional expression, lyrical breath, variety of tones, weight.
 This or that word of the sentence gets a special weight due to its stress.
 In ordinary syntax, the stress of individual members of a sentence remains unnoticed, and any member of the inverted sentence receives a logical stress.
  When a flourishing style is needed, the qualitative elements of the sentence are advanced, the rapid changes of actions, the sequences are manifested by the presentation of the footnotes, etc. ”[1, p. 263].
There are several reasons for the surrounding syntax.
 Let's mention them.
1) The main reason is the shift of logical stress.
This or that part of the sentence can be stressed by the speaker, for which reason it comes forward, և different sentences of the sentence are obtained.
  For example, the bright rays of the bright sun fell in the room in the morning.
The bright rays of the sun fell into the room in the morning.
  The bright ones shone and fell into the room in the morning!
 The bright rays of the sun shone into the room in the morning.
2) The poetic rhyme. eg: Here are the autumn days, They are squeezing fine drops… / ՂA / They have come, they are squealing, the subordinates have fallen for days, drops before their subordinates.
"In prose works, too, sometimes the authors turn their words into poetry.
 Axel Bakunts, for example, uses this means, in whose stories one can often find a circle.
  Like Gulbahar the widow, the moon at night, the miruk in the middle of the white, the Dibon patriarch, the reeds were swaying, the flags were flying, etc. ”[4, p. 265].
3) Addition may be the reason for the circular syntax.
The verbs I, which follow the sentence with the accented word, form an additional sentence, which is followed by the relative sentence.
  For example, they were hearts that melted from his charming appearance.
 It was Lon who could bear it.
4) In order to avoid the accumulation of compatible "multiple" members, some of them are taken after the addition.
For example, a girl like a lampshade, with the eyes of a goddess, Tuberculous, transparent, a dream like a body… / YES / The bloodthirsty cannibals are idle. In the millennium, she hardly became a murderer.
 / HT / You must sound, sound victorious, My old Armenian language, sweet and heartfelt.
 / AI / Learners use the observed examples to interpret the causes and manifestations of the circular syntax according to the different parts of the sentence.
Since the topic was not discussed in the previous classes, therefore we take the teaching from specific linguistic facts to their recognition, generalization, that is, in an inductive "adverbial" way.
SUBJECT AND SUBJECT MATERIALS In ordinary syntax, the subject is placed before the footnote.
For example, blood is dripping from a broken heart, And everyone's face has changed.
 / HT / And the world is bright again.
The country is dear again.
 / VT / And who will be awake at this hour, And what is certain in the world?
 / HT / Naturally, it follows that in the usual syntax the subordinate is placed after the subordinate.
The theoretical material is revealed by eloquent examples selected from fiction.
The subject can be used in the following order, that is, in a circular syntax, when the footnote is used for a special purpose in the sentence. The subject is used at the end of the line, ensuring the rhythm and meaning of the verse.
 For example, countless spring gatherings are called, Let's go, my friend, let's fly to the mountain… / HT / People have cut down the giant tree… / GE / They come furiously at their feet, Crazy Debed is mad.
 / HT / There was a far corner, There was a fair sleep of a child, Happy in a dream, Peace and peaceful humanity.
 / HT / DECISION OF THE DECISION AND OF THE DEFINITE
Avin had a reputation as a good hunter in the village.
  Berdan's ball opened a big wound next to the fat one.
 "Ordinary" / AB / In the Homeland my blood-dye The night fell light and silent, Where there was so much love, And the scent of a rose, հ The fire of the heart.
 The decisive adverb "vrghun" / VT / Arnarnek is formulated after the fullness of the homeland, which emphasizes the bloody state of the homeland, which comes from the mood of the poem, and the light and silent horse items came down after the footnote are also emphasized, stressed because they express the mood.
You must sound, sound victorious, My old Armenian language, sweet and heartfelt.
 (AI) Old Isergil was talking while singing, ձայն her voice, crunchy and muffled, reflected the noise of the forest.
 / MG / It was a blond deer with deep, blue eyes… / AI / The subsequent determiners, if voluminous, are separated from the definite by a dumb, from the other parts of the sentence by a comma.
DETERMINATOR AND SPECIAL SYNDROME In the usual syntax the denominator is placed before the given, and in the circular syntax after և it is not split.
 For example, the ridges of the mountains were dark for a long time, the rays of the sea came out of the waters of the blue mountain lake.
 "Ordinary" / VT / And in your heart I burn the flame of freedom և right, I raise your arm here, Like a snake in the desert "…rgun" / AI / You bent over his wound with pain, and shed two drops of tears.
 /S.K./The adjective is separated from the adjective by a dumb, especially when there is a determiner between them in the form of a verb, that dumb is put in order to prevent semantic confusion.
Day,. Arik looked at the girl with a sad smile on his face.
 / SC / The works of the genius poet depicting the life of the Armenian village are the encyclopedia of the past life.
THE DISCOVERY OF THE DISCOVERY AND THE DISCOVERY Usually the identifier is put after the revelation, it is separated from it by a dumb, from the other members of the sentence by a comma.
"By way of acquaintance, the teacher shows that in a couple of cases the syntax in Armenian has a grammatical value.
  One of them is the syntax of revealing-revealing connection.
 In Armenian, the discoverer is always backward, if we turn it into a sentence, it will change into the discoverer ”[3, p. 293].
To be sure, let's bring examples և try to change the places of the discoverer. We will see that the positions change. Omar Khayyam, the sad poet of Khorasan, drank a cup of clay.
 If we change, it will be Khorasan's sad poet, Omar Khayyam… Sahak, one of the villagers of Akur, was not afraid of the cold or the ice.
 / AB / One of the villagers of Akur, Sahak… Our famous lyricists: P. Duryan, M. Metsarents, Hovh. Tumanyan և others, will always remain in the heart of our people.
Was it not in the rocks that nature hid its treasures, its precious gold veins and diamond crystals?
 (VA) Then the students have to make sure that only the partial identifier can be a sentence, intermediate or infinitive with respect to the object.
 For example, as the leader of the conspiracy, the famous general Smbat Bagratuni was put before the beasts.
The famous general Smbat Bagratuni was put before the beasts as the leader of the conspiracy.
The famous general Smbat Bagratuni, as the leader of the conspiracy, was put before the beasts.
The syntax of verb additions is freer.
 They can be placed before or after the verb, and if they have a logical accent, they must be placed before the verb.
 For example, You come to our mountains, deep valleys. Turbulent-turbid, Araz, Our hearts, deep eyes. Squeeze Arun, go, Araz… / AI / Ar went up arch-arch, Zulu tied a golden belt, The blood fell on the strong fortress, Your love fell into my heart.
 After these explanations, we convince with examples that the circle is typical of the artistic word, it is not an end in itself, it definitely has a stylistic-expressive and aesthetic value.
As we have seen, a sentence consisting of 4-5 words with different word arrangements can have dozens of variants that express different meanings and semantic nuances.
  This is a great wealth of expression that allows the writer to choose the syntactic version that expresses any nuanced meaning.
 Each round must be aesthetically reasoned.
The poetic word is more typical of the circular composition, which makes the word emotional, musical, regulates the rhythm, the sound.
There are many grammatical errors in the written, mostly oral speech of our students, so the teaching of grammar has a very practical significance.
  That is why we should take the teaching of all these with appropriate examples կատարում at the end perform strengthening exercises.
1. Arrange the members of the sentence in a circular composition so that they express a concise idea.
In the fall, the falconers crawled and fell from the trees.
b) The branches of the trees had already sprouted.
c) The birds welcomed the arrival of spring.
2. Highlight the main members և identify their syntax.
 The morning noise of the birds was sweet, the gentle gentleness of the masters was sweet, լ the mountain river murmured sweetly.
 / R / b Suddenly the silence cut off the noise like a sword.
 The rain was pleasant with its sadness.
 / DD / c The evening walks gently tender, The sea stretches its silk neck, The fir trees walk sweetly from the shore, The seagulls have fallen asleep in the fields, are silent.
 / AI / 3. Make the highlighted determinants posterior և split.
The girl was wearing a fashionable woolen dress.
 / AB / b Transparent and person - a white cloud was floating calmly in the azure.
 / AB / c A little girl was coming from a little distance in a silk floral dress with golden curls.
 / TV / 4. Underline the contributors and the allocated, explain their syntax.
His horse's hooves did not obscure the diamond of the springs, they did not obscure the delicate flowers on the roadsides.
 The poet listened to the light music of distant stars.
 Pearls sprouted in the lotus sprouts.
 His soul was ablaze with radiant joy.
 / AI / 5. Find the determinants և denominators, explain their syntax.
The mountains have long since darkened, and the rays of the sun have risen from the waters of the blue mountain lake.
 / VT / b It is the sound of newly opened flowers, the sweetest pestle of rotating cocoons.
I wish the future of my country was so bright, so pure, As bright as the smile in your eyes, And the charm of your face and soul.
 / ԵՉ / 6. Emphasize direct problems, explain their syntax.
a! Shushanik respected his intelligence and development.
  He does not hate anyone, he does not despise anyone, he is ready to respect everyone.
 /Shirv./b Deep on the heights, the human soul loves so much… / NO / c  The wind was blowing, և the horse was breaking the cold waves of the mountain air with its wide chest.
Have you heard this enchanting song, When a sweet sadness burns you, When you hug the stone, bless the water and the land, When you sob from unspoken fortune… / W / LESSON PLAN Subject- Armenian languageLesson topic - Round sentence composition.
Teaching the subordinate և subordinate syntax.
Lesson Objective - 1. Students will learn the usual ար rotation.
2. Students will be able to analyze the circular syntax.
3. Students will develop other personal qualities of learning, expressing thoughts correctly, listening to each other, respecting and tolerating others.
Criteria - a) Make a written word, expressing the thoughts correctly, observing the rules of syntax, spelling and punctuation.
b) To speak, observing the syntactic, orthographic rules of Armenian, to exclude dialect-foreign language pronunciation.
c) Communicate with peers, juniors and seniors in a polite, respectful manner.
 Value system - a ձ striving to know, love and study the Armenian language.
b) Ability to cooperate, tolerance, respect for the point of view of others.
Methods used - "Learning through brainstorming" [6, p. 35], "Discussion in pairs", "Summary in pairs", [6, p. 53], "Reflection on brainstorming or brainstorming" [6, p. 35], "Five-line essay »[6, p. 26].
Learning materials - Tables and posters related to the composition.
Lesson type - New material transfer lesson.
The course of the lesson. Phase I - Until new material is introduced or promoted.
 For this stage we use the "Learning through brainstorming" method.
Students are asked to memorize what they know about the syntax.
  They discuss what they know in pairs և express their opinions.
  We write the voiced opinions on the poster in the left corner of the blackboard.
 There are no right or wrong answers.
 With the consent of the class, the opinion expressed by each person is written down to be mistaken without thinking, which they will find out later.
Phase II - Reporting or interpretation of new material.
  At this stage we use the "Discussion in pairs, summary in pairs" method.
 So, we instruct you to learn the lesson by giving 15 minutes.
 One of the couples reads, the other asks questions, then they change places.
 At the end of the time, two or three pairs from each row explain aloud what they have done in pairs, continuing each other.
 Thus: 1. In direct or ordinary syntax, the subject is placed before the footnote.
 For example, that egg of Atom's speech reassured the Apostle a little.
2. The subject does not change its place when the nominative subjunctive has a grammatical structure of the subject.
 For example, my enemy is my enemy's friend.
3. The subordinate syntax is unchanged when the nominal subordinate node is discounted.
 For example, your sources: crystal calls.
4. The syllable of the subject is a sentence, when it is an indefinite verb, the subjunctive is connected with this, here, to mean with words.
  For example, to love means to live the lives of millions of people.
5. It is written after the subject, when it is necessary to give a word to the ceremony, to the action - when it is necessary, when successive events are told.
  For example, one day Harut was very drunk and drunk in the village, in the middle of the street, the villagers brought him home, they found him at the right moment to tie him up and take him to Kaghzvan, but when Harut woke up, he cursed everyone. massacre.
6. It is written after the subject obligatory footnote, when the author's word is in the direct word or after the last one և indicates to whom the direct word belongs.
  For example, "Would you like to go to Armenia?" Maruk asked in surprise.
7. To avoid enumeration monotony, it is sometimes subordinated after the first footnote of a sentence with multiple footnotes, then the footnote is followed by the other footnotes.
  For example, Hambo was going and thinking.
8. In direct syntax, the footnote follows the subject.
  For example, the sun had already set.
9. If the nominal footnote is without a node, it is always placed after the subordinate.
 For example, he is a lion, I am a lamb.
By observing the samples of fiction, the learners recognize the patterns and manifestations of the circular composition.
 Knowledge will turn into a skill if it is strengthened by training exercises.
  At the end of the work, we refer to the opinions voiced during the promotion phase, հենց the students themselves check what they already know and what they have just learned.
 If there were wrong thoughts in the initial opinions, they correct them.
Homework - Learn the lesson. The material of the textbook (Hovh. Barseghyan, P. Meytikhanyan, Hayots Ave., 8th grade, Yerevan, 2012, pp. 84-87), to complete the assigned task
Reflection - Students remember the beginning of the lesson և one by one the note-taking tasks they did from the beginning to the end of the lesson.
At the end of the lesson, search and logical tasks are performed.
 The following are nominated: 1. In the poetic part, the subject is circled.
 How expressive did the circulating syntax give to the word?
My mother is the door of our hope. My mother is the chapel of our house, My mother is our cradle, My mother is the castle of our house.
 ՀՇ2. Can we invert the subordinate շար footnote in the data section?
Give reasons.
My mother is small, my mother is poor, My mother is an ordinary mother, My mother is in this mother country. Night and strong sun.
 ՀՇ3. By what expressive means is the solemnity of the poetic speech conditioned?
He cries again, he cries incessantly, The longing for the wonderful land is sleepless, And the wings are spread like a master, My soul flies, flies home.
 HT He was in ancient times, in Perch East. A brave military patriot.
 PAIN: Every second I say with sorrow with love, goodbye, I said goodbye in my fiery heart, goodbye.
