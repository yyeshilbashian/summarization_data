Geography is a branch of geography, which deals with the study of specific areas (continents, regions, individual countries), the analysis of the obtained results, the discovery of patterns.
  Provides data on the nature, economy and different aspects of the life of different countries.
 It has two directions: physical-geographical և economic-geographical.
  Causal connections, as well as the interrelationships of natural-economic complexes, lead to general geographical studies [5, p. 196].
Tourism industry, has a large range of studies to present regional geography as a tourism (country) with opportunities.
  Many authors present different approaches և suggest methods for tourism evaluation of countries [1, 3, 7, 8].
In this work, an attempt has been made to present a series of practical works, which will give an opportunity to discover the country with its tourist description.
From a tourism point of view, the terrain is of great importance with its diversity, mild-favorable climate, diversity of water bodies, abundance, biodiversity, population with its diversity, national features, as well as the area with its socio-economic and political description.
The terrain with its landscapes and the role of promoting tourism can be the most attractive factor, you just have to show the right approach.
Particularly important climatic conditions are the weather conditions, which have an impact on people.
Is the determination of the applied temperature temperatures (EP) [1].
One of the most popular methodsClimate tourism resources is the set of climatic conditions that are conducive to the organization of various breeding eggs.
  Climatic conditions are divided into the following groups: favorable, relatively favorable, unfavorable.
To use the population as a tourist factor, with its description, traditions, features, cuisine, etc.
Indigenous-geographical, cultural, ethno-geographical differences of all the countries-states are presented as stimulating factors for the territorial organization of tourism.
In order to implement the tasks set within the framework of the "Tourism Geography" course of the regions, it is planned to organize practical work on the following topics: 1. Regions of the world.
2. Characteristics of the geographical location of the country (state).
3. Tourism assessment of natural components.
4. Tourism assessment of the demographic factor.
5. Recreational description of the country: fill in the table with the list of natural anthropogenic objects.
6. Creation of country tourist guides.
Practical work 1. Regions of the world.
 Present the regions by schematic mapping (Table 1), as well as separate (Figure 1) or tabular regions on the outline map using Fig. 2 maps.
Figure 1. Regions of the world Figure 2. Regions of the world by continents (1) According to UNWTO (2).
This way of doing work will not only provide an opportunity to get acquainted with the regions of the world, but also to draw conclusions about other approaches.

Geographical location is characterized by the relationship with the environment of the object.
  It shapes the face of the country, the development, the way of life, the character of the people.
Since the main object in geography is the country, the state, the geographical location refers to the relationship of the data with other objects outside its territory, which can affect the opportunities for tourism development.
It is considered: 1) as a factor in the development of tourism, 2) as a condition for the development of tourism.
Geographical location, as a factor, presupposes the identification of existing կապ potential connections և analysis, for the development of their tourism, specialization, organizational features ման to determine the impact on technologies.
Thus, the essence of the geographical position is revealed through the system of territorial relations, in which the geographers-scientists distinguish (the characteristics of the geographical position are presented from the point of view of tourism). The Mathematical-geographical position is MAD.

  It is the position of the country in relation to the political and territorial objects outside it, which are usually depicted on political maps.
- Transport-geographical location: TRAD.
  The position of the object (country) in relation to international or major roads can be favorable or unfavorable.
- Ecological-geographical position: EC.
 The characteristics of the country in terms of ecologically different areas are favorable (undisturbed nature, natural areas), nature), crisis (endangered area), catastrophic (uninhabitable area).
  They are presented for pre-elected countries, one country from each region (Table 2).
