Armenians belong to the unique number of nations, most of which live outside the homeland, forming a powerful Armenian Diaspora.
The term "Diaspora" (Greek διάσοπορά, "scattered, scattered") describes the part of a nation (ethnos) that, living outside its historical homeland, has formed united, stable ethnic groups.
 In addition, it is distinguished by the existence of organized social institutions, which guarantee the preservation of one's identity and community1.
  In other words, the Diaspora is the location of ethnic representatives in different countries, which is followed by the emigration of the population from their own country.
 The reasons for the latter can be economic, political, social, etc.
It must be stated that the appreciation of the Diaspora in "scientific", "social" and political circles is assessed from strictly opposite positions.
In particular, on the one hand, the existence of a certain number of compatriots living outside the physical borders of the homeland of any state or nation, but maintaining ties with it, is considered an ex-positive factor, of course, if there is a logical proportion of "compatriots".
  Especially when the problem is viewed in the context of modern globalization through the prism of the possibilities of current information technologies.
  In other words, in today's "shrinking" world, where geographically distant regions are virtually close to each other, the presence of foreign compatriots allows them to be more actively involved in the development of world society (in terms of transformation of ideas, cultural values), but at the same time Sociology.

The next dimension of the assessment refers to the objective fact that the danger of assimilation is real for any Diaspora in time, as the fact that they are cut off from the sustainable nutrition of their ethnic and cultural vitality objectively removes future generations of foreigners from the axis of national identification.
Such a division of the problem is fully expressed for the Armenian nation.
  Today, when the number of Armenians is several times lower than the number of compatriots living abroad, there is an objective need to radically re-evaluate the modern logic of Armenia-Diaspora relations, to find a more effective level of coexistence and cooperation between the two parts of the nation.
With all this, the new social order formed for the domestic scientific circles is completed.
 The complexity and multiplicity of the problem open up different aspects of scientific evaluation.
This work carries out the observation and evaluation of Armenia-Diaspora relations from the position of geography, in particular, social geography, based on its modern methodological arsenal.
 In our opinion, this will make it possible to choose a wider field of view for discussion, as the modern social-scientific function of the system of geographical sciences allows to consider the problem not only in the field of worldview, cognitive-information, cultural significance, but also in scientific-practical sphere.
Observing the historical-geographical process of formation of the Armenian Diaspora, it can be stated that each historical period is unique in its nature, which is conditioned both by the reasons for leaving its homeland and the geographical features of the self-organization of the Diaspora communities.
  The fact that communities of the Armenian Diaspora existed in the early historical past, in parallel with the initial self-organization of the Armenian nation, is confirmed in both foreign and domestic bibliography.
 However, the constant movement of our compatriots outside their own country cannot be considered in the logic of ordinary migration processes, where separate, unique reasons are singled out.
 In the case of the Armenian nation, very often the unique factors merge, multiplying, making the reasons for emigration more influential.
 The main reason is often the absence of Armenian statehood, in which case the pressure of foreign residence, not infrequently the threat of physical existence, forced our compatriots to leave their own country.
 However, often, in the case of statehood, our compatriots also emigrated, sharply reducing the state-social potential of their own country, as a result of which the original statehood was lost.
Thus, a divisive situation has been created, which is based on the objective-subjective bases of the formation of the Armenian Diaspora.
 For the analysis of these grounds, we single out two areas of observation: • Objective reasons for the formation of the Armenian Diaspora.
 This group of reasons has always been predominant in the absence of statehood, when the imposition of foreign coexistence in one's own country has made the spatial basis of self-organization the same for individuals and even social groups, in one's own country or in a foreign one.
The most obvious in this area are the forced migrations organized by foreigners, which, unfortunately, have not been rare in our history.
In this case, there is also the opinion that the reasons for the loss of statehood and deportation from one's own country cannot be considered only on an objective basis.
  In other words, the reasons for statelessness and self-organization in other geographical areas cannot be discussed only in the sphere of objective spatial-temporal factors: unfavorable geographical position, unfavorable course of geopolitical realities of the time, expansionist ambitions of ethnic foreign elements, etc.
 It is obvious that the development of historical events by undesirable logic was predetermined for subjective reasons.
 In particular, in the absence of statehood, the existence of the nation was ensured by strong kinship ties, as a result, the preservation of individual-national identity was considered a priority from the collective national coexistence, ie from the collective idea of ​​living in its own geographical space.
 And in this case, passive adaptation has been achieved to the realities of leaving the homeland, deprivation of the homeland, deportation.
It is clear that all this gives a subjective nature to the problems we observe.
  However, one must take into account the fact that at a time when a nation struggling to survive in order to make sense of its sufferings and trials would eventually lead to a life philosophy of reparation.
 Therefore, in the absence of statehood, we accept the objective basis for the Diaspora formed due to emigration, deportation, and deprivation of the homeland in general.
• The next aspect of the observation refers to the subjective reasons for the formation of the Armenian Diaspora, which are fully expressed, especially in the conditions of the statehood.
  In their own country, deprived of the opportunities for self-realization, our compatriots very often continued to consider the state with its geographical, social-political meaning, sought other spaces for their own self-realization.
 Of course, in this case, the powerful potential of the Armenian type is brought to the fore, for the realization of which often the independent state has not been able to provide the necessary environment.
However, one should not ignore the national mentality formed at the time, influenced by the principles of national bio-philosophy.
 The latter has almost always been built on the contradiction of individual-collective logics of national biophilosophy.
  In other words, the national gathering identity was often opposed to individual successes, in the case of which the geographical space was pushed to the background.
 As an example, it can be argued that during the modern history, during the existence of two independent Armenian republics, 1 population 1 In the professional literature, the existence of three Armenian republics is often argued in the 20th century: 1918-1920, 1920-1991. և After 1991.
 However, the negative balance of migration.
 In particular, during the two years of the independence of the First Republic (1918-1920) the population of Armenia decreased from 1 million 200 thousand to 720 thousand 1.
 And during the 20 years of the existence of the Second Republic (1991-2010) the emigration rates were 700 thousand - 1 million 300 thousand 2.
 It is obvious that the sharp predominance of emigration among the geographical movements of the population in the discussed periods was conditioned by political, socio-economic, psychological psychological reasons - war situations, very difficult socio-economic conditions, manifestations of civil injustice and inequality.
 However, in our opinion, the latter are mainly not a reason for emigration, but a setback.
 In other words, emigration sharply reduces the social-civil vitality, the resistance to the problems, due to which the social tension of the society increases regularly.
  Therefore, in the conditions of statehood, we consider the reasons for the formation of the Diaspora through emigration to be subjective.
Accepting the conditionality of the separation of the above-mentioned reasons for the formation of the Armenian Diaspora, nevertheless, it should be noted that they often mutually agreed with each other, therefore, they often made the fact of emigration from Armenia frequent.
As a consequence, today the existence of the multi-million Armenian Diaspora, which exceeds the population of the homeland several times, is several times more prominent.
  Of course, the latter is first of all conditioned by the geographical features of the self-organization of the Diaspora.
  However, in the same multi-layered, the difference between the reasons for leaving the homeland is quite obvious.
  The correct assessment of the latter will give an opportunity to make more effective not only the activity of the Diaspora structures, in the opinion of 1920-1991. The Soviet Socialist Republic of Armenia, which existed during the 1930s, cannot be considered an independent republic, as it was not an independent subject of international law.
