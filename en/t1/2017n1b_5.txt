Well-known Spanish journalist Jose Antonio Guriaran is the author of books, two of which are dedicated to Armenians.
  Moreover, Guriaran referred to the Armenians, particularly the Armenian Genocide, in 1982. In the novel "The Bomb" published in 1959, presenting the topic of the Armenian Genocide for the first time in Spanish literature.
  It should be noted that this novel by Spanish writers dedicated to the Armenian Genocide, including Guriaran, has not been subjected to literary analysis by Armenian Spanish literary critics.
 The article examines the novel-typological features of "Bomb", the philosophical problem, moreover, the material is presented on the basis of a specific analysis of the original, therefore, in order to reveal the writer's ideas and position, we have made a number of original quotations.
  Moreover, the translations quoted from the original are ours.
The reality is that the so-called "Armenian terrorism" is one of the remarkable and at the same time dramatic pages of the Armenian history, which received its characterization in the fictional literature of the Armenian-Spanish writer Ruben Perperyan in 1981. In the novel "The Rage of Envy" published by
 This little-studied topic is presented in Guriaran's novel "The Bomb", in which the genocide is depicted through Armenian terrorism.
  The real, authentic characters in the novel are the members of ASALA, who in the 80s tried to remind the world about the Armenian Genocide through terrorism.
 It is worth remembering that terrorist acts in Spain are first of all connected with Basque terrorist groups.
  In Spain in the 60s. The terrorist acts of the beginning և were reflected in Spanish literature.
 The first works on this subject were Roberto Velasquez Rera's Seven Days to Die (1963) and Ra Ռl Gera Garrido's The Unusual Reading of Capital (1977).
In fact, an interesting pattern can be seen between the discussion of the Armenian Genocide, the asking of questions and the given geography. "
 In our opinion, the territorial factor is essential in this issue իղ directly to the sub-theme of comparative genocide.
 Thus, in Turkish-Arabic literature, the literary hero is mainly a Muslimized Armenian woman who reveals her roots at the end of her life (typical of Turkish literature), tells her own story through her grandchildren, or the reader of Arabic prose witnesses the hero (in this case, the majority are Muslim. the images of Armenian women) to internal psychological upheavals [2, 118121].
  This must be explained by the fact that during the genocide in the above-mentioned countries there was one of the consequences of the genocide - the phenomenon of "stolen lives" [11] and the consequent rediscovery of identity, reconciliation with memories.
 And the survivors, who have mainly taken refuge or formed the Armenian Diaspora, are characterized by the themes of patriotism and longing.
 The novel is an autobiographical diary, with which the writer tells the story of 1980. His story of being seriously injured by two ASALA bombs detonated in the square called "Gran Via" ("Great Road") in Madrid on December 29.
  The two novels written by Guriaran on the Armenian theme can be analyzed by a biographical method, that is, the role and significance of the writer's life experience and personal knowledge can be used in the creation of a literary work.
 Guriaran builds the novel with "self-reflection" (absolute identity of the artistic image - the real story), as a confession, where the story of his own life becomes not only an opportunity to depict the consequences of the genocide and its tragic impact in general, but also the painful problems of violence, terrorism and hatred.
  At the same time, let us emphasize that the novel does not only tell the story of 1980. The story of the bomb planted by ASALA in Madrid, but through the fate of an individual, opens the way to a wide range of universal questions.
 The author uses the trick to make the novel more convincing and touching, revealing not only the chain of events, but also the inner world of the heroes by introducing the diary.
  Not only is the author's purposefulness dictated by the diagram of the structure of the novel, but he also "creates directness in the first person, captures the reader's sympathy, directing him to the emotional life of the character."
  The first person intensifies the tension of the story և the emotional impact ”[4, 94].
 The blog egg provides the sound side of the story, and in terms of content it is the autobiography, the author of which acquires characters in the fictional story.
  The main character in the story is completely identical to the author, but it is not dissolved in the work.
 It is noticeable that Guriaran builds the novel on the principles of "objective novel" applied in Spanish prose since the middle of the last century, which means that "literature has restored the value of the subject, has begun to pay attention to the inner process of man" [7, 310], and the latter is technically used. through the "flow of consciousness" or "internal monologue" [5, 333].
 The plot of the novel is intertwined with the inner monologue of the hero and his reflections on his own person, due to which the monologue and the inner structure of the novel are not limited to diary and psychological possibilities.
 Note that cognition is the starting point and essence of human self-knowledge, and the artistic texture, with minimal plot and psychological deepening (introspection), tends to reveal the hero's self-search, during which the author is identified with the diary image, moreover, the border and reality.
  Guriaran uses the trick of the flow of consciousness as a powerful means of expression, especially as part of its internal analysis, which helps to analyze the character, as a result of which the novel is perceived as a diary or autobiography, filled with inner monologue and meditation.
The novel first of all presents the story of the writer's life, an absolutely true and touching story, which always fascinates the reader, because we have to agree that "a successful narrative prose is a sincere prose" [4, 318].
 The "bomb" tries to show the way to forgiveness, revenge and hatred accumulated inside, it is done by the example of Guriaranmard-literary hero.
 "The concept of a person, a person, which is transferred to literature and literary image, is the concept of looking at his world, orienting himself through that world" [1,79], and in the novel the boundaries of reality's Presence coincide in the case of author and image, which brings the writer Guriaran to the forefront. Here the gastronomic thought can be understood in the literal sense: "Man is nothing but drama. His life is a pure and absolute event that takes place with each of us, and within which each of us in turn is just an event" [10, 32].
 The writer presents and generalizes the situation of the victims of the genocide from the position of the victim of terrorism (personal suffering), shows a way to forgive each of the victims with his own experience.
"Why a bomb?"
  This is a means of explanation, another "opposition to a group isolated from society" in the margins, which is looking for its own claim in the square.
  It is a page of a bomb magazine, a program on radio and television, because what did we know before that? ”[9, 137],” Guriaran asks.
  On the other hand, it can be assumed that a bomb is a symbol of an explosion in a person, when a person suddenly notices or simply discovers the inside of another person standing next to him.
  The bomb is meant to explode human indifference to the Armenian pain, to achieve its recognition and to realize the pain of others as one's own.
 The writer tells about the psychological feelings of an individual and their painful and morbid effects, observing all this by the example of ASALA terrorists.
 Guriaran presents the feelings and psychological traumas of each of these terrorists, the tragedy of their fate.
In addition to the main topic of the victim-executioner relationship, the writer delves into new themes and secondary motives: the revelation of the psychological depth and soul wounds of the descendants of genocide survivors, the depiction of a person's personal drama, in the context of which
The journalist bedridden tries to overcome his fears, at the same time outlining the topic of loneliness and alienation, the destruction of values, the lack of justice, which leads to desperate attempts to restore justice through terrorism.
 Guriaran also depicts the crisis of values ​​and points out the way to overcome it: humanity and kindness, Christian self-purification.
  The semantic structure of the novel is based on the human problem from the very beginning.
 The problem of the "bomb" is the person and the problem, when it is aggravated in the conditions of weakening (often absence) of moral orientations of life.
In the novel, the heroes themselves expose the injustice, the cruel indifference of the society, which makes them react with the same cruel response.
 Speaking about his hero Pascual Duarte, writer Jose Sella expressed the following thought: "After all, the one who is called a criminal is just a tool. The real criminal is the society that produces the tool or allows them to be produced ”[8, 528].
 The protagonists of the novel portrayed a generation that had not lived through the genocide but had heard it from their parents or grandmothers, whose suffering had caused them psychological trauma.
 The idea that "the survivors of the genocide, however, were some living hamlets, subject to the persistent demand of vengeful ghosts of the innocent" [3, 189], and in general, the ghosts of the present creeping past were to force the youth of the new generation to break the wall of silence and indifference.
 In addition, "the ghost of revenge as a justification for the murder of children evokes a kinship obligation to avenge the blood of a relative, a fact that has been transferred from the family level to a new symbolic level of nationalism," Joan Frijole states in his article "Genocide և Reproduction" referring to the genocide.
In the thirties of the 20th century, the trendist novel (tremendo in Spanish means horrible, terrifying, hence the name "cruel realism" of the literary current) was introduced into Spanish literature, in which the hero fought against his surroundings and himself, and to create justice with his own hands. it became a way of working.
 By the way, this was conditioned by the cruelty of the human spirit of cruelty, against which the characters of the trend-setting prose came out.
  "There is always a lonely person in the center of trend-setting work.
 The world is shown not through the interweaving of social relations, not through the context of society and history, but through the destiny of that person ”[6, 43].
 From this point of view, there is an interesting similarity between the actions of Armenian terrorists and the actions of the characters depicted in Spanish literature. "
 It is clear that for the Spaniard, the sense of justice (fairness) is a national line, when the individual himself tries to be a judge, to achieve a fair amount of justice, which received its artistic expression in the works of the Spanish writers of the 1898 generation.
  This is what he found in the novel "The Bomb". Heroism and self-sacrifice become the choice of heroes, which starts from human indifference or is the denial of it.
Thus, the above-mentioned study shows that Guriaran's novel is characterized by the manifestation of elements of autobiographical prose, the discovery of the psychological complexes of the descendants of genocide survivors, the depiction of a person's personal drama.
 Guriaran, depicting the aftermath of the genocide, does not address the Armenian Genocide directly or through a primary prism.
 The author, the narrator, becomes an artistic character, whose peculiarities of speech express the essential lines of his thinking and character.
  Thus, the writer examines the genocide in a deductive way, reaching the value of human destiny and drama in general.
