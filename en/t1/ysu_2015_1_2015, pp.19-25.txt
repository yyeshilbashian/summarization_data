ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL AND ACTIVITY OF THE AMASIA REGION OF SHIRAK MARZ, RA Introduction.
  Changes in the environment are not new, they occur over billions of years, and today, with the intervention of humans and other living organisms, these changes continue at an accelerated rate and on a large scale.
 By disrupting the natural state of ecosystems, all of this poses a serious threat to society.
In recent decades, a number of environmental issues have arisen due to the disturbance of the natural balance of ecosystems due to anthropogenic factors and environmental pollution [5].
One of the most important areas of human activity affecting the environment is agricultural activity.
 It is estimated that about 38% of the Earth's land area is used for agriculture, which is a food source for mankind.
Agricultural activity is a source of environmental pollution.
  Groundwater, which is the source of drinking water for more than 50% of the world's population, including 100% of the rural population, is directly exposed to agricultural fertilizers, pesticides and other chemicals, which is a potential hazard to human health. [10]
In case of population growth at such a rapid rate, it is predicted that by 2050. it will reach about 9 billion.
  At the same time, human demand for agricultural products will increase, and the development of agriculture, in turn, may raise a number of environmental issues.
In the Amasia region of the Shirak region of the Republic of Armenia, the main occupation of the population is agriculture, which is the main source of environmental pollution.
  Agriculture in this region is mainly specialized in crop production (particularly grain production) and animal husbandry (cattle breeding) [1].
The aim of the study is to assess the impact of agricultural activities on the Amasia regional environment of the RA Shirak region.
Materials և methods.
 The object of the research was the Amasia region of the RA Shirak region.
  The studies were conducted in 20092012.
The contents of nitrogen and phosphorus imported into the environment as a result of human agricultural (livestock) activity. Wallenweider (1970).
According to R. According to Wallenweider (1970), 156 kg և 17 kg of phosphorus is introduced into the environment through the annual excretion of 1000 kg of cattle, and 119 kg և 20 kg respectively for small cattle.
  Assuming the average weight of cattle in the Amasia region is 450 kg, and small cattle - 50 kg, then: N x = 450 x N st.x / 1000 (1), P x = 450 x P st.x / 1000 (3), N m = 50 x N st / 1000 (2), P m = 50 x P st.m / 1000 (4), where N k, P k և N m, P m are the nitrogen-phosphorus contents of one large and one small cattle, respectively, and N st.x, P st.x և N st.m, P st.m., respectively, the nitrogen-phosphorus contents of 1000 kg of live cattle excretion into the environment from small cattle.
According to R. In Vollenweider (1970), 10 g / m2 of nitrogen and 1.45 g / m2 of phosphorus are imported annually to 1 ha of pasture with medium load.
  Consequently, it turns out that 1.4 head of large cattle or 14.5 head of cattle can be grazed per hectare.
  It turns out that 10.4 conventional head of cattle need one conventional head of pasture required for a large cattle.
The constants in 20092012 were calculated using the constants presented in Table 1. In the Amasia region, the combustion of crop residues (straw) from wheat հիմնական barley crops due to combustion of greenhouse gases, in particular carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon dioxide (CO), nitrous oxide (N2O) (N2O) (N2O) [

 According to R. Wallenweider (1970): Calculated in the Amasia region for 2009-2012. The nitrogen-phosphorus content of the livestock environment following livestock is given in Table 3.
According to the data of the Shirak Marz Statistics Agency, the calculations made in the livestock sector show that in 2009-2012. An increase in the number of livestock was observed in the Amasia region, which contributed to the increase in phosphorus content of the environment ազոտ imported from the livestock sector to the environment (Table 2, 3).
 According to G. Raspletins և B. According to Tusakov, 1.5% of the phosphorus content in the soil through the excrement of cattle and 10-20% of the nitrogen content passes into surface water, hence the continuous nature of the nitrogen-phosphorus content imported into the environment from the livestock sector without increasing Taking appropriate environmental measures can have a negative impact on the environment, particularly water resources, leading to overcrowding of aquatic ecosystems with biomaterials.

The table shows that the load of pastures in this region was very low, but the development of livestock without taking appropriate environmental measures in turn can have a negative impact on aquatic ecosystems, contributing to the pollution of the latter with biodiversity.

  In arable lands are grown mainly perennial herbs և a small amount of grain crops (mainly wheat և barley).
According to our observations, after the harvest in 1 hectare of wheat field in the region, about 2.5 tons of straw remains, and in 1 hectare of barley field - 1.9 tons.
 90% of the composition of the latter is dry matter.
 This region is notable for the abundance of grasslands, pastures, after which the straw is not mainly used as fodder, it burns almost completely (about 90%).
The impact of agricultural activities on the environment is reflected in the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere due to the burning of agricultural residues and over-fertilization of lands [2, 9, 11].
2009-2012 The sown areas of the main grain crops in the Amasia region այր the burnt straw data of wheat and barley are presented in Tables 5 և 6.
According to [3], 47.1% of burnt straw is carbon and 0.66% is nitrogen.

In the Amasia region, greenhouse gases, in particular carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon dioxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (N2O) containing nitrogen (N2O) (nitrous oxide (N2O)), are released into the atmosphere as a result of combustion of crop residues (straw) from cereals and barley. in.

  Taking into account the socio-economic conditions of the Amasia region, it can be stated that the nitrogen-phosphorus contents generated by livestock in this region can penetrate into aquatic ecosystems, polluting them.
  In order to prevent possible contamination of water resources due to livestock in the region, it is necessary to build manure storage areas, create buffer zones between pastures and aquatic ecosystems, and carry out regular grazing of livestock.
Burning of plant residues (straw) from agricultural activities in the Amasia region contributes to the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
  All this contributes to the disruption of carbon-nitrogen circulation, as large amounts of carbon-nitrogen pass from the soil to the atmosphere through the gas compounds.
Therefore, in order to avoid the negative consequences of burning crop residues, it is recommended to use them as fodder, regardless of the abundance of grasslands and pastures in the region.
