Timeliness.
  Along with scientific and technical progressStrengthening the health of schoolchildren is becoming more urgent։ Improving the level of mobility.
 Because oursThe activity of schoolchildren has significantly decreased in recent daysvolumes.
When defining human abilities, it is necessary to take into account:that they include the sum of individual abilities,by which people differ from each other.
  Relatively little of the various human abilities have been studied in terms of mobility [3,4].
  As a result of numerous scientific researchesIt has been found that in recent years there has been a deterioration in the mobility of schoolchildren [1,2].
  Motor abilities are the ability to move, to make movements.
They are specific to all living things, develop physiogenetically, are genetically predetermined, and naturally determine the ontogenetic characteristics of humans [3,8].
  Motor abilities և properties have not yet been separated from each other և are often used as synonyms.
  Actually moving propertiesreflect the quality of different motor abilitieslevel.
  Hence, the motor properties of the human motorare the individual components of the possibilities with which each personendowed by birth.
 Attempts are currently being made to correct this situation, but they are not fundamental. are aimed at improving the methodology of developing motor skills, without taking into account other important factors.
 This process can include organizational, logistical, software, personnel and other changes.[1,4].
  The low level of mobility of schoolchildren is a consequence of the non-targeted, systematic educational work in the field of general education.
  In the process of developing and developing motor skills, theyThey have a certain effect on each other, which is called transportation,it can be positive or negative.
 In case of positive transportationAlong with one motor ability, other motor abilities are developed, and in case of negative transport, whichThe development of mobility leaves no interaction with the otheron abilities [5,7].
  Morphofunctional development of the organismThe qualitative aspects of the motor actions of children of different ages are conditioned by the age patterns of the features.
  Speed ​​capabilities are as followsկարող Ability to make movements that require strength ևComplex speed output.
 In other words, speed capabilities are human abilities that need to be demonstratedmaximum force in the shortest unit of time [6,8].
Problems.
  1. Determine the mobility of 11-12 year old schoolchildrenthe level of abilities.
2. Find out ցուցանիշ anthropometric test resultsPercentage of data correlation coefficientvalue.
3. Determine the group of exercises that is highly correlatedis correlated with anthropometric indicators և movingwith abilities to effectively organize the further educational process.

The results.
  The analysis of the results of the research revealed that the connection between the mobility ընդ anthropometric indicators of 11-12 year old schoolchildren has a correlational correlation.
 100 boys participating in the study(Table 1) Height index High correlationhas the following test to assess mobilitywith tests: running 30 m from a high start (PS <0.774, D = 59.9%), running 300 m(PS <0.785, D = 61.2%) և long jump (PS <0.789, D = 62.5%).
  From the data obtained in the year, it can be assumed that the height index is a possible factorconsidered at this age the level of mobilitywhich proves the percentage value of the relative correlation of the length of the lower limb with the following:with test exercises: run 300 m (PS <0.847, D = 71.8%), on the spotlong jump (PS <0.734, D = 53.8%).
  There is a moderate correlation between the length of the lower extremity ազ running 30 m from a high start (PS≤0.610, D = 37.2%) և.
  In sprinting, the length of the step is considered a important factor, so in this case, the average correlation, in our opinion, is due to the starting momentum.
Weight has a high correlation ratio with speedwith exercises characterizing the abilities, running 30 m with a high start (PS <0.698, D = 48.7%), long jump (PS <0.675, D = 45.5%).
  JumpingThe exercise is also considered to be of a high-speed nature.
  But thisin case of low correlation (PS> 0.369, D = 13.6%),In our opinion, it is due to the vertical increase of the general center of gravity of the body, which also has some technical difficulties.
During the research, we were interested in what it was likeRelatively correlated are the test exercises that assess motor skills.
  Annual data:show that running from a height of 30 m Exercise as an indicator of agility in high relative correlationof all the test exercises offered to the subjectswith 300 m (PS <0.895, D = 75.6%), long jump (PS <0.917, D = 84.1%),yield (PS <0.904, D = 81.7%).
  The figures show that:The high correlation is due to the rapid nature of the exercises.
  From this we can assume that thisAt this age it is necessary to pay great attention to the number of speed exercises.
 Jogging 300 m as a measure of endurance is moderately correlatedlong jump (PS≤0.524, D = 27.5%) և jump (PS≤0.510, D = 26.1%)with exercises.
  In our opinion, this indicator of correlationIt would have been a lower percentage value if a longer distance of more than 300 m had been chosen as a test of endurance for boys.
The two jumping exercises are highly correlated: long jump and jump (PS <0.920, D = 86.1%).
  Lungs:vital capacity in low correlationis running with 30 m exercise (PS> 0.320, D = 10.3%), and running in 300 m exercise, which assesses the level of endurance of schoolchildren, is highly dependent (PS <0.795, D = 63.5%).
  From here you can:Investigate the fact that ICT is a determinant of resilienceto improve the level.
          The picture of the indicators of the surveyed girls (Table 2) is as follows:Relative anthropometric parameters of 11-12 year old boys - motor skillsCorrelation ային Percentage valueAnthropometricIndicators և:test testsHeightWeight:Bottom:limblength:ICT:Running 30 mhigh:one.Jogging:300 mFrom the place:long jump Jumping(Abalakov)system:Table 1:HeightWeight:Lower limblength:ICT:Running 300 mLong jump Jumping (Abalakov)համակ.Running 30 m high from the startAcquaintance.

The height index has a high correlation percentage as a percentage of running from 30 m high start (PS <0.928, D = 86.1%);Running 300 m (PS <0.930, D = 87.4%) և Long jump (PS <0.902, D = 81.3%) exercises.
  Weight index with high correlation percentageIt is worth running 30 m from a high start (PS <0.719, D = 51.7%) և long jump (PS <0.867, D = 75.1%) exercises.
 Lower limb length index is highly correlated with running 30 m from a high start (PS <0.741, D = 54.9%), running 300 m (PS <0.909, D = 82.6%), long jump(PS <0.875, D = 76.5%) with exercises.
 The length of the lower limbբարձր High correlation of speed mobility, oursIn their opinion, they are conditioned by the length of the step.
  Date received:The data speak to a possible factor of these anthropometric indicatorswhich is necessary for the comprehensive and harmonious development of schoolchildren.
  The weight ratio is 300% of the average correlation from the anthropometric indicators, the distance is 300 m(PS≤0.641, D = 41.1%) և with exercise (PS≤0.528, D = 27.8%).
The length of the lower limb և between the single test ևThe average correlation percentage is also observed, whichIn our opinion, it is natural, because these exercises characterize endurance-jumping, and these motor abilities have little to do with anthropometric indicators.
 A low percentage of correlation was observed between the subjects's height-separated exercise (PS> 0.392, D = 15.4%).In our opinion, this exercise is a typical high-speed exercise, where the height index does not matter much.
         Considering the relative correlation of the test exercises that assess motor skills, the girls' 30 m exercise is highly correlated with all the suggestedwith test tests: 300 m (PS <0.914, D = 83.5%), long jump (PS <0.958, D = 91.7%), long jump (PS <0.867, D = 75.1%).
 Running from a height of 30 m The exercise characterizes the level of rapid motor skills of the subjects.
 Therefore, we can assume thatAgility is a key factor for schoolchildren of this age,which substantiates the data of professional literature.

As expected, low-correlation is the endurance 300m run ժ jumpingTest tests: long jump (PS> 0.428, D = 18.3%) և jump(PS> 0.431, D = 18.5%).
 Numerical data show that endurance as a motor ability is not related to explosive forcewith expressive motor skills, in other words, jump test exercises.
  High cost of interconnectednesswas observed in long jump (PS <0.967,D = 93.5%), these exercises are typical high-speed,, reciprocalHigh connectivity is predictable.
 We were interested in the researchAlso, the level of correlation between the volume of lung capacity of schoolchildren, anthropometric indicators and test tests.
 From the obtained results it is obvious that ICT is highly correlated with running test tests (running 30 m PS <0.741, D = 54.9%, running 300 m PS <0.848, D = 79.1%) ևwith weight (PS <0.854, D = 72.9%).
 In our opinion, the high correlation is due to the large amount of oxygen during the runat a cost, especially it is observed 300 m characteristic of endurancerunning.
 No significant correlation was observed between jumping exercisesև Between the volume of ICT և.
