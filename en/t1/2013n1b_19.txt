Timeliness.
  Strengthening the health of schoolchildren and improving the level of motor skills are becoming more urgent along with scientific and technical progress.
 Because nowadays the volumes of movement activity of schoolchildren have significantly decreased.
When defining human abilities, it is necessary to take into account that they include the sum of individual abilities, by which people differ from each other.
  Relatively little of the various human abilities have been studied in terms of mobility [3,4].
  Numerous scientific studies have shown that in recent years there has been a deterioration in the mobility of schoolchildren [1,2].
  Motor abilities are the ability to move, to make movements.
They are specific to all living things, develop physiogenetically, are genetically predetermined, and naturally determine the ontogenetic characteristics of humans [3,8].
  Motor abilities և properties have not yet been separated from each other և are often used as synonyms.
  In fact, motor skills reflect the quality of different motor skills.
  Therefore, motor qualities are separate components of human mobility, with which every human being is endowed with birth.
 Attempts are currently being made to correct this situation, but they are not fundamental. are aimed at improving the methodology of developing motor skills, without taking into account other important factors.
 This process includes organizational, logistical, software, personnel and other changes [1,4].
  The low level of mobility of schoolchildren is a consequence of the non-targeted, systematic educational work in the field of general education.
  In the process of developing and exploring motor skills, they have a certain effect on each other, which is called transportation, it can be positive or negative.
 In the case of a positive transport, the other motor abilities are developed along with the other mobility, and in the case of a negative transport, the development of the mobile ability does not interact with the other abilities [5,7].
  The qualitative aspects of the motor actions of children of different ages are conditioned by the age patterns of the morphofunctional developmental features of the organism.
  Acceleration capabilities are the ability to perform movements that require a complex acceleration of force.
 In other words, speed capabilities are human abilities that require maximum external force in the shortest unit of time [6,8].
Problems.
  1. Determine the level of mobility of 11-12 year old schoolchildren.
2. Find out the percentage value of the coefficient of correlation between the indicators of the test tests and the human data.
3. Identify the group of exercises that are highly correlated with anthropometric indicators and mobility skills to effectively organize the further educational process.
Methods: 1. Analysis of professional literature, 2. Test testing, 3. Pedagogical observation.
The results.
  The analysis of the results of the research revealed that the connection between the mobility ընդ anthropometric indicators of 11-12 year old schoolchildren has a correlational correlation.
 The height index of 100 boys (Table 1) participating in the study with the following tests evaluating the motor skills of high relative correlation with running from 30 m high start (PS <0.774, D = 59.9%), running 300 m (PS <0.785, D = 61.2%) և long jump (PS <0.789, D = 62.5%).
  From the data obtained, it can be assumed that height is a significant factor in determining the level of mobility at this age, which proves the percentage of the relative correlation of lower limb length with post-exercise exercises: 300 m (PS <0.847, D = 71.8%) PS <0.734, D = 53.8%).
  There is a moderate correlation between the length of the lower extremity ազ running 30 m from a high start (PS≤0.610, D = 37.2%) և.
  In sprinting, the length of the step is considered a important factor, so in this case, the average correlation, in our opinion, is due to the starting momentum.
Weight has a high correlation with speed-training exercises, running 30 m high start (PS <0.698, D = 48.7%), long jump (PS <0.675, D = 45.5%).
  Jumping exercise is also considered to be of a high-speed nature.
  However, in this case, the low correlation (PS> 0.369, D = 13.6%), in our opinion, is due to the vertical increase of the total center of gravity of the body, which also has some technical difficulties.
During the research, we were also interested in the correlation between the test exercises that assess motor skills.
  The data show that running from 30 m above the start exercise as an indicator of agility with all the test exercises offered to the subjects in high relative correlation: 300 m (PS <0.895, D = 75.6%), long jump (PS <0.917, D = 84.1%). ), taken (PS <0.904, D = 81.7%).
  The data show that the high correlation is due to the rapid nature of the exercises.
  From this we can assume that in this age it is necessary to pay great attention to the number of speed exercises.
 Running 300 m as a means of assessing the level of endurance is in average correlation with long jump (PS≤0.524, D = 27.5%) and long jump (PS≤0.510, D = 26.1%).
  In our opinion, this indicator would have a lower percentage of correlation if a longer distance than 300 m was chosen as a test of endurance for boys.
The two jumping exercises are highly correlated: long jump and jump (PS <0.920, D = 86.1%).
  Pulmonary vitality is correlated with a low correlation with running 30 m (PS> 0.320, D = 10.3%) and running at 300 m, which assesses the level of endurance of schoolchildren, is highly correlated (PS <0.795, D = 63.5%).
  From this it can be concluded that ICT is a decisive factor in improving the level of resilience.

The height index has a high correlation value as a percentage of running from 30 m high start (PS <0.928, D = 86.1%), running 300 m (PS <0.930, D = 87.4%) և long jump (PS <0.902, D = 81.3%) exercises .
  The weight index has a high correlation percentage with running from 30 m high start (PS <0.719, D = 51.7%) and long jump (PS <0.867, D = 75.1%) exercises.
 The lower extremity length index is highly correlated with running 30 m high start (PS <0.741, D = 54.9%), running 300 m (PS <0.909, D = 82.6%), long jump (PS <0.875, D = 76.5%). .
 The length of the lower limb - the high correlation of the speed of movement, in the long run, is conditioned by the length of the step.
  The data obtained speak of a possible factor of these anthropometric indicators, which is necessary for the comprehensive and harmonious development of schoolchildren.
  The percentage of average correlation from the anthropometric indicators has the weight ratio, running with 300m (PS≤0.641, D = 41.1%) և single (PS≤0.528, D = 27.8%) exercises.
The length of the lower extremity և in the individual test is also observed as a percentage of the mean correlation, which, in our opinion, is normal, as these exercises are characterized by endurance-jumping, and these motor skills have little to do with anthropometric parameters.
 A low percentage of correlation was observed between the subjects's height-separated exercise (PS> 0.392, D = 15.4%), in our opinion, this exercise is a typical high-speed exercise, where the height index is not particularly important.
         Considering the relative correlation between the test exercises that assess motor skills, the girls' 30 m exercise is highly correlated with the all-round tests offered: 300 m (PS <0.914, D = 83.5%), long jump (PS <0.958, D = 91.7%), jump (PS). <0.867, D = 75.1%).
 Running from a height of 30 m The exercise characterizes the level of rapid motor skills of the subjects.
 Therefore, we can assume that mobility is a possible factor for schoolchildren of this age, which substantiates the data of professional literature.

As expected, 300 300m exercise to determine the level of endurance's low correlation և ստ Jumping tests: long jump (PS> 0.428, D = 18.3%) և Jump (PS> 0.431, D = 18.5%).
 The data show that endurance as a motor ability is not related to explosive motor skills, in other words, jumping test exercises.
  High correlation was observed between long-distance jumping exercises (PS <0.967, D = 93.5%), these exercises are typically high-speed, and high-correlation is predictable.
 During the research, we will be interested in the level of correlation between the volume of the lung capacity of schoolchildren, the level of anthropometric indicators and test tests.
 It is obvious from the obtained results that ICT is highly correlated with running test tests (running 30 m PS <0.741, D = 54.9%, running 300 m PS <0.848, D = 79.1%) Weight (PS <0.854, D = 72.9%) ) with indicators.
 In our opinion, the high correlation is due to the large amount of oxygen consumption during the run, especially it is observed in the 300 runners that characterize endurance.
 No significant correlation was observed between the volume of jumping exercises "ICT volume".
