The authors have given many definitions of work motivation, which generally describe a combination of motivational forces that give a certain direction to human activity, define a goal that satisfies individual and organizational interests.
  Among the external forces, the sense of debt և, the motives for being approved, gaining prestige stand out.
 And internal forces are the motivations for growth, self-development, prosperity from the process of activity.
socialization, enjoyment of life relationships, "Work efficiency is maximized" in case of satisfying external motivations.
Different authors suggest different classifications of staff motivational tools և methods, but in general all tools can be divided into two main groups: material և non-material.
 Material motivational factors, in turn, are financial ֆինանսական non-financial, immoral, organizational և leisure [2, 4].
Motivational Factors: Material and Inorganic Organization Incentive packages are additional incentives offered by the organization to motivate the employee.
  They are made up of non-financial Jochvra.
When creating such a package, the organization should take into account a number of factors, in particular, the incentive package should ․ • be accepted by the majority of employees as motivational factors relevant to the material, relevant, which will be more comfortable than the market offer, services • can • be designed so that employees do not feel unfair [3, p. 249].
Benefit packages are mainly aimed at increasing the economic security of employees, ensuring the retention of employees.
There are various compensations that are given to the employees as a support to their basic salary.
Some incentives are legally binding, while others are dependent on the organization.
The incentives included in the incentive packages most often include the following benefits: Pension program Pension amount at the employee's pension account.
  In some cases, it is carried out by the employer և is considered a component of the incentive package.
Monthly health և accident insuranceHealth insurance is a mandatory component of the incentive package in some countries, and in some countries the employer decides whether or not to provide it.
  Dental insurance, elderly or child care can be part of health insurance.
 In some organizations, the psychological service is also used as a component of health insurance.
Paid permission to participate in occasions The reasons for this are the birth of a new family member and the death of a relative, in which case paid free hours are provided from the working day [5].

This helps to increase employee motivation at work.
  In some cases, the employee has the opportunity for gifts or [6].
  From the list of such prizes, choose your gift trips, additional days off, theater tickets, etc.
The incentive packages include discount systems provided by the organization's partner organizations, in which case the employee of the organization pays less for a certain service than planned.
  Such services often operate within the framework of cooperation with gyms and service centers.
