The works of the well-known Armenian writer Avetis Aharonyan / 1866-1948 /, in particular the fictional prose, were evaluated from different points of view, evaluated with different inclusions, and interpreted during the author's lifetime.
  A number of Armenian writers, critics, public figures and other intellectuals of different generations have appeared in literary articles published in the press, in some textbooks or in separate books dedicated to the writer.
 In this article, we present to the readers' attention the principles of analysis of Aharonyan's fiction by Western Armenian and Diaspora Armenian writers and critics, their assessments.
During the Soviet years, the negative attitude towards A. Aharonian, a member of the ARF Dashnaktsutyun and chairman of the National Council of the First Republic of Armenia, made him a banned writer.
  The themes taken from the national life of the Armenian-Armenian prose writer and the works with patriotic and freedom-loving ideas were close to the heart of the Armenians living in the Diaspora, longing for the homeland.
  Famous Western Armenian and Diaspora Armenian writers, critics, scientists and other intellectuals such as D. Aharonyan evaluated the ideological and artistic merits of Aharonyan's stories, novels and novels. Varuzhan, K. Zaryan, N. Adonts, M. Parsamyan, N. Aghbalyan, H. Oshakan, Hamastegh, H. Karapents և others.
  It is only in the post-Soviet years that a number of notable writers and literary critics / St. Topchyan, A. Yeghiazaryan, J. Kalantaryan, D. Gasparyan և others / valued the legacy of the newspaper.
 At the same time, the opinions of the above-mentioned Armenian-Armenian and Diaspora Armenian writers, critics and intellectuals about Aharonyan's work are of both literary and contemporary significance.
  In a unique way, they contribute to the appreciation of the different aspects of the artistic and ideological content of the writer's prose.
In the 1900s, in contrast to those who considered A. Aharonyan a "lazy" and pessimistic writer, Daniel Varuzhan highly praised him as a singer of the liberation struggle, as the poet put himself, an apostle of the struggle.
  Varuzhan, who was especially known for his collection "Tseghinsirt" (1909), presented the poem "The Shepherd" in the "Epic" part of the book to "A. Aharonyan" 1.
  The theme of the poem was close to Aharonyan's work, especially to the stories in his collection "On the Way to Freedom" (1906).
 Varuzhan was probably well acquainted with them, as with other works of the prose writer.
  This is evidenced by the fact that the poet was interested in Aharonyan's drama "Valley of Tears".
 While still working as a teacher in Sebastia, a group of girls led by Varuzhan presented Avetis Aharonyan 's "Valley of Tears" in favor of the Gorg Workers' Union.
  Before the performance, Varuzhan gave a speech (it was not preserved).
And here in 1909. Varuzhan writes the poem "My Deputies" on the occasion of Aharonyan's imprisonment in Metekh prison in Tbilissi (Georgia).
  1910 The text published for the first time in "Azatamart" had the gift "A. Aharonyan" / the author later posted it in 1912. in the "Flowers of Golgotha" series of "Pagan Songs" published 3 /.
  Here, with his typical image, Varuzhan gave hope to the imprisoned writer, tightened his belt, writing: But there the Struggle of the Apostle has a lock in the prison. Strong blow with your wings, crush the ashes on its window, And give you the shant, Sing the hope, resting on its shoulder.
Say that soon we will stand the statue in its glory.
Ah, go, hawk, I will give you a laurel.
Famous Diaspora Armenian writer and critic H. Oshakan refers to the evaluation of Aharonyan's works back in the 1910s.
  With its characteristic aesthetic taste and insight, it presents a number of significant achievements and shortcomings of the writer's multi-genre works.
  Evaluating A. Aharonian's prose works in the processes of Armenian literature of the time, the critic considered the writer's contribution unconditionally significant in 1895-1896. In responding և to the artistic response to the heroic events of the tragedy, to the feudal struggle.
  He considers the collection "On the Way to Freedom" to be the writer's creative achievement in that field.
"It is the most beautiful memory of our heroic battle, a glorious height in the societies of patriotic literature, where the eyes love to rest with pride.
  Reddened by the pure blood of hundreds of thousands of martyrs, trembling with the immortal devotion of our heroes, this book is the best gem we can lay on the immortal grave of the dead with peace of mind, with the peaceful gift of that precious gift comforted in our mourning.
S. Yeremyan, an Armenian-Armenian critic and member of the Mekhitarist Congregation, emphasizes the writer's preferences for expressing "pessimism" and "fighting moods", testifies to the influence he has gained and the influence he has had on young writers.
From 1929 to 1930 The Diaspora Armenians widely celebrated the 40th anniversary of the famous writer's literary activity in different colonies of the world.
  The culmination of the events was the famous Sorbonne University in Paris in 1930. The commemoration that took place on May 1, where Aharonyan is speaking.
  On the occasion of this jubilee, in addition to various printed materials and articles published in the press, books dedicated to his literary activity are also published.
  Their authors analyze the writer's prose works or express opinions about them at different levels of professionalism.
  In his speech at the Sorbonne University on the occasion of the writer's anniversary, the well-known Armenian historian N. Adonts points out the "realistic" and romantic nuances typical of Aharonyan's works.
  The originality of the works and the great potential of educating the generations of the Armenian people are valid.
 "Aharonyan's volumes," he said, "should educate and ennoble generations, instilling a knightly spirit for the welfare of the Homeland, inspiring love for the Armenian people, the Armenian Homeland and its wonderful nature."
The study of writer-critic M. Parsamyan "Avetis Aharonyan, his life - literature" published in Paris in 1930 is more remarkable from the point of view of analyzing Aharonyan's fiction in the domain of one work.
 The author comments on Aharonyan's works based on the principles of world aesthetics, some new understandings spread in Western European literature of the beginning of the century, existentialism, philosophical view of intuitionism.
  The characters created by the writer examine their conscious and subconscious potential, the relationship between the individual and society, using the fact of raising the inner world of the Armenian man from the perspective of national and universal values.
  In his relatively extensive book, M. Parsamyan tries to regulate the creative activity.
 The critic is able to show subtle observation in connection with the interpretations of individual works, tries to reveal the context of the literary work, to show the relations of the literary work, the characters with the reality.
  In spite of all this, we believe, he has remained at the level of interpreting literary phenomena with their visible surface.
  The enthusiastic high marks of individual works are often not substantiated by full and comprehensive interpretations of the content and the horse, or superficial explanations are given.
  And sometimes the excessive evaluation of some works was due to the fact that more attention was paid to them.
  Thus, for example, referring to some really artistically valuable works ("The Traveler", "When the Snow Drops", "Katushk", "Under the Ashes"), he writes: "With this new series of his stories, Aharonyan painted new horizons in our fiction.
 It is the universal questions that begin to touch his pen. ”6
  Especially considering the new prose-ideological qualities of the writer from the Diaspora, he singles out this period and makes original observations.
 Speaking about the book "Imgirk", he mentions its unique significance in the writer's legacy.
 "It is the condensation of its content literature, thoughts and sensitive soul" 7.
  There are remarkable interpretations in the study, but they do not present the deep, comprehensive literary analysis of Aharonyan's work with a coherent logic, complete and solid narration.
  This book by M. Parsamyan, however, remains the only comprehensive study of the author published before, containing in some cases accurate comments and assessments.
Speaking about Aharonyan in this period, literary critic N. Aghbalyan emphasized his ideological, philosophical position of relating the national to universal problems. "No matter how much controversy there is about the perfection of his art, but if he does not give a taste of ten, he speaks from the heart of a thousand, teaching thousands to think and act in public, this is a great work in itself.
 It is the daily bread for the political Armenians, the great impetus for the self-contained Armenian to come out of his isolation. ”8
The constellation in Aharonyan's works is a manifestation of the principles of different literary directions / realism, epicism, mysticism, decadence /.
 In addition, he saw a close connection between Aharonyan's works and the ideological and artistic traditions created by the Armenian writers of the past (Abovyan, Raffi, Alishan, Peshiktashlyan).
  Out of the originality of the ip-writer style, Hamastegh emphasized Aharonyan's subordinate, ideological-aesthetic approach in the creation of characters.
 "For him," he writes, "he could have said what he had to say in a beautiful way."
  It was a deprivation for him not to enrich the type or description with his lavish imagination, if it was "Mother" և or the owner "Solon" 9 ".
 The constellation proves that Aharonyan's name had become "charming and magical" for the people, and the preconditions for that were the writer's sincerity, the ability to express the people's emotions and feelings and the ability to be a great patriot.
"In Aharonyan's literature," writes Hamastegh, "there was one aspiration, one goal - to save the Armenian people. Laocoon և imitated his children with huge snakes.
 The critics did not want to understand that they were looking for the description of a literary school in Aharonyan.
 If Aharonyan was not literate, he would have walked in the mountains of Armenia like a feta to sacrifice himself to the Armenian people.
  Aharonyan Անդր or Andranik's leaders have been the same in the struggle for our national existence ”10.
The writer's son, V. Aharonyan, managed to publish ten volumes of his father's works in Boston, USA from 1947 to 1951.
  In the first volume, he posted an extensive review entitled "Avetis Aharonyan / Life and Work /".
  It is especially valuable due to the author's reliable information about A. Aharonyan's biography.
1958 In the essay written on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the writer's death, writer-publicist H. Karapents approached the appreciation of Aharonyan's works, especially in dramatic situations, from the point of view of creating images with psychological nuances.
"His focus is on man and human tragedy," he writes.
 - And due to the ability of the psychologist Aharonyan accurately analyzes the inner worlds, penetrates into the hearts, touches the essential, creates patterns.
  Aharonyan is unsurpassed when dealing with descriptions subject to mental anxiety.
 It is there in its perfect element. ”11
A. Aharonyan's interest in his works reached its next focus in the Diaspora in 1966, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of his birth.
  This year's joint issue 8-9 of the literary magazine "Bagin" published in Beirut is completely dedicated to the famous writer.
 Among the new published materials, the analyzes of several valuable Aharonyan stories are especially remarkable, which are given to P. Snapyan "The grooves of the" Tribal Field ", A. Haykaz's" Reading of "Hazre", N. In Patanyan's "Vazrik on the way to freedom" articles.
  These were the first attempts to analyze these stories.
 The "managing editor" of the magazine K. Sassouni tries to outline the place of the writer and the novelties brought in the Armenian literature, the literary influences mentioned.
 He wrote in particular: "If we put aside Aharonyan's political, philological and historical works, we should only pay attention to his literary works, we should consider Raffi's immediate successor, with his breath and national aspirations.
  Raffien Aharonyan's difference is that a pious and Soviet-oriented direction will include Aharonyan, preserving the characteristics of a fiction school. ”12
 And here, the writer, literary critic Mushegh Ishkhan, emphasizing the combination of romantic ("Kh. Abovyan" is a "poetic soul")'s orthodox principles expressed in Aharonyan's works, adds that. "The general ideological concern is stronger in itself than the striving for perfection of art.
  Sometimes heroes turn into incarnations of suffering or heroic superman.
  Instead of all these exaggerations, which harm the nature of his works, Aharonian fascinates us with his colorful descriptions ”13.
  The approaches expressed in the above-mentioned printed materials, regardless of the degree of accuracy of the formulations (as well as the effort to praise a party friend), A. Aharonyan's literary heritage were not made from the point of view of serious, generally accepted literary understandings, in this case from the point of view of literary and theoretical regularities.
In the pre-Soviet period in the Armenian-Armenian reality, in addition to praising Aharonyan's artistic works / Leo, Vrt. Papazyan և others /, there were expressions of sharp critical attitude.
  From the point of view of their political and aesthetic views, Aharonyan's works were critically evaluated by J. Khanzadyan, famous poet V. Teryan.
 It is known that V. Teryan in his speech-study "The Coming Day of Armenian Literature" / 1914 /, thinking about the prospects of the development of Armenian literature, openly denied the effectiveness of Aharonyan's literary path, giving preference to Shirvanzade.
  It has already been observed in modern Armenian criticism that the similar position of the great Armenian poet այլ the other extreme assessments expressed in that speech were conditioned not only by the demand for high standards of fiction, but also by ideological differences.
  Teryan opposed the social and political tendencies of the national parties from the point of view of the national-political and cultural programs of the "new intelligentsia", the "Russian advanced democratic intelligentsia".
"To a large extent, this extreme ideological contradiction should be attributed to the extreme of Teryan critique of 19th century literature and worldview."
We think that V. towards Aharonyan Teryan's attitude was partly conditioned by the fact that at that time the prose writer was already a well-known figure of the ARF party.
  In fact, he criticized Aharonyan mostly from that political point of view. Khanzadyan.
  Former Speaker of the Parliament of the First Republic of Armenia A. Due to the negative attitude towards Aharonyan during the Soviet years, when evaluating his works of art, J. Khanzadyan, Ed. Jrbashyan, A. Ohanyan with obviously one-sided assessments and superficial analyzes15.
  In this context, the opinions and comments of the Armenian-Armenian authors presented in the article further contribute to the literary analysis of the works of the writer, who was loved and widely read during his time.
  This became especially obvious today, when well-known Armenian contemporary literary critics wrote articles about Aharonyan with an unprejudiced approach and scientific integrity.
  Candidate / author V. was defended about him. Grigoryan / և doctoral / author: G. Khachikyan / dissertations.
 It follows from the above that a biased approach conditioned by political views and interests, while analyzing and valuing the writer's works of art, hinders the task of evaluating the literary phenomenon impartially, according to real merits.
