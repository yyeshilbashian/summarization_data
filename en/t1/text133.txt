 As we know, the changes in tax revenues of the reporting years compared to previous years are conditioned by a number of circumstances, and in order to know the role of the Tax Administration in it, we must make an in-depth factor analysis.
 Thus, tax revenues and state duties in 2019 amounted to 1464.3 billion drams, which is 206.2 billion drams or 16.4% more than the same indicator of the previous year.

  As of January 1, 2020, the debt to taxpayers amounted to 76.6 billion drams, which means that as of January 1, 2018, the existing debt decreased by 199.1 billion drams.
  It is obvious that the debt owed to the taxpayers was repaid at the expense of the declared tax revenues.
 It follows from the above that in 2018 and 2019 tax revenues increased by 505.4 billion drams, part of which was directed to 298 ECONOMICS to repay the debt of taxpayers by 199.1 billion drams, and the other part increased the actual state budget flows by 306.3 billion drams.
