The urgency of the research.
  For the development of tourism in mountainous countries, as well as for the construction of infrastructure, it is necessary to analyze the dimensional data, in particular the deep and horizontal fragmentation of the relief.
  Such an analysis will allow not only to assess the opportunities for tourism development in the northern regions of the republic (Shirak, Lori, Tavush), but also to outline the prospects for the development of that branch.
Research materials և methodology.
  The ArcGIS 10.2 software system was used to calculate and map the fragmentation depth և fragmentation densities of the study area.
1 The research was carried out with the financial support provided by the University within the framework of the scientific topic № GSPI 01-SCI-2017.
The numerical model of the relief of the studied area served as a base area for the calculation of the mentioned indicators 1.
On a scale of 100,000.
Map of the depths of fragmentation.
  As it is known, the depth of the area is an indicator, which is the area of ​​the square. is the difference between the highest and lowest points of the relief in the area of ​​km.
  ArcGIS10.2 software environment lacks the appropriate tools for direct calculation of this indicator.
  That is why there was a need to develop the necessary sequence of operations in the ArcGIS software environment, using the available toolkits in the form of ZonalStatistics, Math, Conversion, Interpolation toolkits, during which all the necessary calculations were performed.
  Subjecting the obtained result by the IDW method of interpolation, the map of the relief-division depths of the territory of Northern Armenia (Shirak, Lori, Tavush) was obtained.
Map of fragmentation densities.
  The density of the division of the area is expressed in units sq. The value of the total erosion network length in km area.
  The Spatial Analyst toolkit was used to calculate the index և mapping.
  Based on the digital terrain model of the study area և erosion network, the fragmentation density values ​​were calculated.
In carrying out the research, we used Yu. A. Antiptsia [1] և V.I. One of the methodological provisions proposed by Anisimova [2].
The results of the research.
  Large-scale scale of Northern Armenia formed by us (1.
100000) map analysis shows that the region is characterized by disproportionate fragmentation.
  Greater fragmentation is observed in the northeastern regions, where corrugated and corrugated mountain structures predominate.
Relatively weak fragmentation is observed in the western regions of the study area, particularly in the Shirak region, which is due to the predominance of volcanic relief.
The combination of the data in Table 1 of the Digital Map (No. 1) shows that areas with a depth of more than 1000 m occupy the largest areas in Lori Marz (273 km2), which is 7.2% of the total area of ​​the Marz.
  The same indicator for Tavushimarz is respectively, 239 km և 8.8%.
Unlike Lori and Tavush, in Shirak region there are no areas of deeper division than 1000 m.

1 The picturesque valley of the Martz River stands out with its deep division.
 The latter stretches for 29 km.
 It is almost completely forested.
 It creates beautiful landscapes in many parts, which is a good precondition for tourist routes.
The middle stream of Aghst, Getik basin, as well as the middle stream basins of Dzoraget and Pambak rivers stand out in deep fragmentation in the studied area.
 Beautiful landscapes and landscapes have emerged due to deep fragmentation in all the mentioned areas.
The deep fragmentation of the relief significantly affects the recreational activity.
  It provides the diversity of the landscape, the visibility of the panorama.
  The great deep fragmentation provides beautiful scenery, which is highly valued by tourists.

1 During the research, another morphometric indicator of the relief, the horizontal fragmentation, was thoroughly studied.
The analysis of the map compiled by us shows that the horizontal fragmentation is directly related to the genealogical feature of the relief.
 Intermountain depressions Volcanic plateaus are characterized by relatively low fragmentation densities (up to 0.4) and valleys do not exceed 0.2.
 One valley or gorge covers an area of ​​more than 10 km2.

In general, the connection between the recreation of geomorphological indicators is expressed in different ways.
 The presence of mountain systems of different heights allows to carry out different types of tourist routes.
  Fragmentation depth և density indicators show the degree of complexity of the routes.
  In general, the fragmented terrain is favorable for various types of recreation and tourism.
 It causes great aesthetic pleasure to those who prefer scenic and aesthetic routes.

 The indicators of deep fragmentation, which are unfavorable for tourism, particularly for regular roads, occupy 1311 km2 in Shirak region, which makes 48% of the total area of ​​the region.
  In contrast to tourism, the territory of the region is more favorable for medical and health recreation.
  The same index of deep fragmentation (up to 300 m) is more favorable for the organization of medical and health rest.

  The division density is estimated by the same principle.
The tourism assessment indicators of the relief of the studied area are presented in Table 4.
The data in the table show that the territory of Northern Armenia is generally favorable for the development of both recreation and various forms of e-tourism.
  Moreover, it can be noticed that the data of deep fragmentation are inversely proportional for recreation and tourism.
 In other words, the indicators that are unfavorable for recreational tourism.
  This circumstance is important because it allows to develop several types of recreation and tourism in the same area.

Such indicators of fragmentation density are normal, as in the conditions of strongly fragmented mountainous terrain, the passage becomes more difficult, the transfers of vacationers and tourists, the construction, operation and development of infrastructure, including roads.
  All the mentioned factors are directly conditioned by the horizontal fragmentation of the relief.
Conclusions.
 Summarizing the work done, we present certain conclusions.1. Relief is a powerful factor for the development of recreation and tourism.
 It can both promote and limit the development of these branches.
2. The development of different forms of tourism, as well as infrastructure, are conditioned by the geomorphological features of the relief, in particular by morphometric indicators.
