1. Introduction.
  One of the existing computer mathematics systems, the Mathematica system is considered to be the world leader [1-4].
  In Mathematica, most problems are solved in a dialog mode, without the traditional programming, using standard tools.
Problems of the theory of elasticity of construction mechanics lead to the solution of differential equations under well-known finite edge conditions [5,6].
  Recently, due to the development of modern computing technologies, approximate methods for solving differential equations are becoming widely used.
 Among these approximate methods, the method of finite differences (networks) has a special place [5,6].
The work presents the problem of temperature distribution of a rod consisting of three homogeneous parts, which leads to a differential equation of the parabolic type with the corresponding preliminary և terminal conditions.
  The network method is used to solve this problem.
Different problem solving scheme և calculation program in Mathematica environment.
  Research has been conducted from the point of view of concurrence, as a result of which the practical concurrence is confirmed quite quickly.
Then, the above problem is generalized to a rod made of homogeneous parts.
  The problem has a rather general formulation, the "solution is clarified for the general case, in case of arbitrary preliminary" term conditions.
 In this case, the "problem-solving scheme" is compiled in the Mathematica environment.
The developed program is universal և gives an opportunity to solve the problem in case of general conditions.
 In addition, it is interactive and available to non-programmers.
 The resulting program is implemented for the problem of a rod consisting of three homogeneous parts և shows the complete coincidence of the results with the solution obtained above.
The set problems ները the methods of their solution are of great interest.

 Consider a thin rod of length։.
 Straighten the ox along the shaft.
 The 0 𝑥 𝑥 ≤ 𝑙 thin rod consists of three homogeneous parts with different physical characteristics: 0 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 𝑙1, 0 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 𝑙2 և 0 ≤ 𝑥 𝑙 𝑙3.
  The specific heat capacity, density, coefficient of thermal conductivity of the 0 𝑥 𝑥 ≤ մաս part of the rod are 𝑐1, 𝜌1, 𝜅1, respectively; .
0 ≤ 𝑥 𝑙 ,1, 0 ≤ 𝑥 𝑙 𝑙2 և 0 𝑥 𝑥 ≤ 𝑙 are distributed along the parts of the rod with powers 𝑞1 (x, t), 𝑞2 (x, t) 𝑞 𝑞3 (x, t) respectivelyN
k. 1 heat, and the initial temperatures of these parts are 𝑢1 (𝑥), 𝑢2 (𝑥) 𝑢 𝑢3 (𝑥).
 The temperatures of the left and right ends of the rod are 𝑢1 (0) և 𝑢3 (𝑙), respectively.
 It is required to determine the temperature distribution 𝑢 (𝑥, 𝑡) of the composite rod during the period 0 <𝑡 <։.
Let's make a different scheme of problem solving.
Given that the initial conditions of the problem under consideration (𝑛1, 0) ունեն (𝑛1 + 𝑛2, 0) have nodes, let us assume that 𝑢 (𝑛1ℎ1, 0) = 𝑢1 (𝑛1ℎ1), 𝑢 (𝑛1ℎ1 + 𝑛2ℎ2, 0) = 𝑢2 (𝑛1ℎ1 + 𝑛2ℎ2, 0).
 In that case, where the following appointments are made:
For the stability of the solution it is necessary to ընտրել choose the step so that the following condition is satisfied [6]: {(1 - 2𝜎1), (1 - 𝜎4 - 𝜎5), (1 - 2𝜎2), (1 - 𝜎6 - 𝜎7), (1 - 2𝜎3 )։ ≥ 0.
Solve the thermal field problem of a rod consisting of three homogeneous parts under the following conditions: 𝑙 = 2.8 m, 𝑙1 = 0.5 m, 𝑙2 = 1.5 m, 𝑙3 = 0.8 m, 𝑐1 = 1 Ջ

Note, however, that by changing this input in the program, you can get the solution to the problem.
The problem-solving calculation program in Mathematica environment looks like u1 [x_].
= 4√𝑥 -1; u2 [x_].
= -x ^ 2 + 2; u3 [x_].
= - (x-2.5) ^ 2 + 1; q1 [t_, x_].
= Cos [x]; q2 [t_, x_].
= Sin [t]; q3 [t_, x_].
= 10 (Sin [x] + Cos [t]); f1 [i_, j_].
= q1 [i , j h1]  / ro1 / c1; f2 [i_, j_].
= q2 [i , n1 h1 + (j-n1) h2]  / ro2 / c2; f3 [i_, j_].
= q3 [i, n1h1 + n2 h2 + (j-n1-n2) h3]  / ro3 / c3; g1 [i_, j_].
= q1 [i , j h1]  / rce1; g2 [i_, j_].
= q2 [i , n1 h1 + (j -n1) h2]  / rce2; The first seven rows of the program provide the input data, and the next rows provide the computational process.
The obtained results can be graphically expressed through the following program: The result is the output corresponding to the function 𝑢 (𝑥, 𝑡) (Fig. 2).
Fig. 2 Graph the dependence of the function և (𝑥, 𝑡) on the coordinate at time t = 0, t = 5𝜏, t = 10𝜏, t = 15𝜏 using the following program (Fig. 3): Fig. 3 Then present the results differently: h1 = 0.1 (green), h1 = 0.5 (blue), h1 = 0.025 (red) in case of steps (Fig. 4).

 In the case where (𝑖 = 1, 𝑛̅̅̅̅̅) և the following appointments are made, for the stability of the solution it is necessary to choose the step so that the following condition is satisfied [6]: {(1 - 2𝜎𝑖), (1 - 𝜔𝑖 - 𝛿𝑖) ≥ ≥ 0 .
Now let's present the calculation program in Mathematica environment.
The first part of the program (Fig. 5) allows you to create input fields for entering the given initial data. for example, NmbHmgnPrt [z_].
 = Row [{TextCell ["Enter n ∶"],
In case of a function call, an input field is created for entering the number of rod homosexuals, and Fig. 5 In case of a function call, an input field is created for the input of the pole 𝑖 mass mass coefficient.
In the second part of the project (Fig. 6) the first part is implemented. 6 given NmbHmgnPrt [𝑖], NmbCrdLyrFrstPrt [𝑖], NmbTmprLyr [𝑖] functions for entering the number of homogeneous parts of the rod, respectively, for the first homogeneous site according to the number of coordinate steps և for the number of time steps.
 In the third part of the project (Fig. 7) homogeneous parts of the rod are created. Fields corresponding to the 7 imported quantities (data entered in the second part of the program) for the length of each homogeneous part of the rod, the specific heat capacity, density, thermal conductivity, the initial condition given in that part, the applied heat function.
In the fourth part of the program (Fig. 8) the steps of each rod section are determined according to the coordinates and their quantities.
Appointments in the fifth part of the program for further simplification of the program.
(Fig. 9) some intermediate Figs are made. Fig. 8 9 The sixth part of the project (Fig. 10) presents the implementation of the differential scheme, as a result of which the 𝑢 (𝑥, 𝑡) surface is displayed in the seventh part of the project (Fig. 11).
Fig. Fig. 10 11 Fig. 12 We will apply 𝑛 the calculation program for the study of the thermal field of a rod consisting of homogeneous parts in point 2, in case of the problem of the thermal field of a rod consisting of three homogeneous parts.
Run the first part of the program (Fig. 5), then the second (Fig. 6) ենք enter the relevant data in the displayed fields (Fig. 12).
Fig. 13 In accordance with the number of imported homogeneous parts (in our case 3), after launching the third part of the program (Fig. 7), they are exported to introduce the physical properties of the homogeneous parts of the field (Fig. 13).
Then we run the 4th, 5th և 6th parts of the program (Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10) և, finally, after the launch of the 7th part, the searchable surface is displayed (Fig. 14).
  As a result, we get the same solution as in point 2 (Fig. 2).
4. Conclusion.
 Thus, we can say that the method of finite differences (networks) continues to be relevant և widely used in various fields of science.
 The finite difference method is an approximate method of solving differential equations in mathematical physics, but the latter provides great accuracy, which is shown in Fig. 14 confirm the observed studies.
 At the same time, at this stage in the development of computer mathematics, the method of networking has become more widely developed, in which the Mathematica environment plays a major role as the world's leading computer mathematics system.
 Using the Mathematica environment as a modern high-level programming language, we get the opportunity to solve a large number of algebraic equation systems in a matter of seconds, to compute calculations of explicit schemes, to interpolate tabular data with appropriate functions, making it graphically observable.
The problems observed in the work are of great interest from a practical point of view.
  The problems are solved in case of general conditions.
  Compiled calculation programs are quite accessible for non-programmers և provide great accuracy.
