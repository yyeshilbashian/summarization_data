It has been proven in our previous scientific publicationsthe fact 1 that the identification value of Armenian coexistenceThe components are unique, not uniquein the case of civilizations.
  Therefore, they individually provided the system-builder of civilizationsubcategory requiredtheirthe result of simultaneous coexistence and interactionwas a satisfactory condition of the Armenian local civilizationfor casting.

And:That is, all system-building components - area (T),(H),genealogyCulture (M), statehood (P), "objective reality"!in the subjective consciousness come the Armenianoriginality, shaping the Armenian civilization (HC).
Linguistic thinking(L), faith(Ծ),Note that according to the theory put forward 2: ifdevelopment of unique components of value identificationAs a result, the state type of coexistence is formed, then:Opportunity is created through institutionalizationto raise them to the level of civilization.

As a result, it has risen to the maximum of coexistencedegree - the level of local civilization.
Thus, in the spatial-temporal logic of the existence of the Armenian statehood, one should also look for the Armenian onethe independent existence of a local civilization.
  The life of the lattercyclical movement and realization of civilized valuesThe level was not only local civilizationsaccordinglynecessary for life-activitiescomponent, but provided World Civilizationthe integrity of this type.
generationTherefore, in the case of Armenian coexistence, it clearly worksThe formula for the formation of local civilizations:ՀՔ = ՀՊ (ՀՏ x ՀԾ x ՀԼ x ՀԿ x ՀՄ),Accordingly,Armenian civilization is a functionis:from system-building components - arguments.
  Resolution:each argument has its exact place, the functions of whichThey are clear, in reality, spatial-temporal realin expression.
  Because the formula is a product of argumentspresented, then they are in interdependence, whichIt is expressed in a dual nature.
The first interdependence is expressed in valuesin size.
  Each argument, as a producer, has its ownvalue, therefore, the higher that value, the higher it isthe total.
 That is, the Armenian civilization:as a product, in direct dependenceis hisfrom the value of manufacturers (system-building components).
  How much?The higher they are, the stronger the Armenian civilizationon the contrary, it reduces their weakness (low cost)The potential of Armenian civilization.
The next interdependence requires argumentsreal existence as the absence of each of themat the same time proves the absence of a common product.any producer, if it is zero, then the whole product is zerobecomes.
  Let us emphasize that such claims are realas a whole, են operate only on civilizationIn this case.
  That is, in the absence of the lattersystem-building components(arguments) canto exist independently, even in isolation.
  But thatin this case only the relict state of coexistence is ensured,when it is not in the absence of its own civilizationassimilated by other civilizations.
As the formula shows, the system is the first fiveThe component of statehood stands out from the components.
  If:the former appear as ordinary arguments,then statehood stands out վում is seen as thema generalizing law governing universal regularity.
In other words, the statehood itself depends on other arguments:moreover, both separately and togethergreatness.
  Therefore, it is also true of the following formulasexistence. ՀՊ = ՀՊ (ՀՏ x ՀԾ x ՀԼ x ՀԿ x ՀՄ) և simultaneously: ՀՊ = ՀՊ (ՀՏ), ՀՊ = ՀՊ (ՀԾ), ՀՊ = ՀՊ (ՀԼ), ՀՊ = ՀՊ (ՀԿ), ՀՊ = ՀՊ (ՀՄ).
Such a process is timely for the Armenian statehoodmakes the components in the above formulas mandatoryThe following change is for the functions discusseddo they exist in reality?inverse functions.
  For example, the above functionswill be combined HT = HT (HP), HJ = HJ (HP), HL = HL (HP), HK = HK (HP), HM = HMWith (HP).
  That is, Armenian statehoodeachfunction becomes itself at a certain level of developmenta stronghold for the development of his arguments.
function:The same logicof Civilization?In this case, but only in terms of the statehood component.
Because, as we mentioned before, the state allowssystem builderև:to raise the level of civilization.
 Thus, they are applicablethe following resolutions: institutionalizeIngredients:HC = HC (HP) - when the Armenian civilization is directdepends on the power of the state.
  At the same timealso operates: HP = HP(PC) Resolution where ArmeniancivilizationIngredients:support(argument) for development.

 Otherwise identificationtakes place at lower levels: nation, people, race,at the family level.
  That is,eachIngredients:identification:level.
  Moreover, in our opinion, it is clearly expressedby subordination, from territorial to state.
 Of course, today ևNot infrequently throughout history, there are cases when:individuals, groups identified at a higher level:without having the minimum relevant subcategories.
  For example:to carry an Armenian without the unification of territory, language and faithculture,or:other similar manifestations.
 But time will tell(proves today) that it is not only temporarybears (maximum one or two generations), but hinders(hindered) the unification of civilization.
  Therefore,It is necessary in the future movement of Armenian civilizationto rule out similar problems to ensure thatthe possibility of movement.

Therefore, the Armenian state must ensure thatseparate և simultaneous existence of components,which in turn will ensure the "fullness of the Armenian individual,"Armenian:andcompleteness.
