1. Introduction.
  Numerical-functional series play a great role in both theoretical and applied mathematics, compiling mathematical analysis of educational institutions specializing in mathematics and physics, higher mathematics.one of the possible components of the course [1].
Numerical և functional arrays are widely used in approximate calculations: calculating the values ​​of functions, calculating integrals ևin other issues [1,2].
Digital methods are now quite widespread և softwareare the rapid development of modern science.
Mathematica has always been regarded as the world's leading computer mathematics system.
 It provides manySolving multidisciplinary problems in dialog mode while being a modern high-level programming language [3-7].
However, using it as a programming environment,Computational programs have been developed that allow you to calculate the values ​​of functions at given points, to determine the values ​​of certain integrals,how to solve differential equations.
Numerical calculations have been made, research has been carried outfrom the point of view of concurrence.
 The resulting methods are effectiveIt is also presented using graphical elements of Mathematica environment, making them more observant.
Solving these problems using Mathematica environment programming capabilities is relevant, both 'scientific' and 'valuable'.from a methodological point of view.
2. Calculate the values ​​of functions through step series.
Computational programs in Mathematica environment.
 Given a point in the function:The value is based on a function according to the Taylor series analysis.
 Suppose the function 𝑦 = 𝑓 (𝑥) is given և it is necessary to determine the latterthe value at point 𝑥 =։.
 Suppose that the function 𝑦 = 𝑓 (𝑥) is some of the points 𝑥 = 𝑎(containing () satisfies the conditions of Taylor analysis [1], resulting in:Analysis by function (1) allows in most casescalculate the values ​​of these functions with great accuracy.
Now let's present the calculation program in Mathematica environment,which allows you to calculate the values ​​of functions at any point:using Taylor analysis.
 It looks like this:The first line of the program provides the input part of the data.
𝑓 (𝑥) իան is the function, − է is the point at which the value of the function is calculated,կետ is the point around which the function is analyzed according to the Taylor series, andէ քանակ is the number of stored members in the count process.
  SecondThe line provides the actual calculation process.
  The last line of the programprovides the output of relevant data.
The program is presented for the case when 𝑓 (𝑥) = 𝑒 𝑥, 𝑎 = 2, 𝑐 = 2.1, 𝑘 = 5, which allows հաշ2.1 to be calculated to the nearest six digits.
  As a result of the implementation of the program we will get:Here 𝑛 ն is the number of members in Taylor, and 𝑆 [դրան] դրան to itthe corresponding result.
 Let's visualize the results nowgraphically.
  The graphic presentation sub-program has the following:appearance:> {Text ["S [1]", {1.0005,8.13}], Text ["S [2]", {1.0017,8.165}], Text ["exactvalue ", {1.005,8.1720537}]}, AxesLabel -> {," S [n] "}, Ticks -> {None, Automatic}]As a result of the project implementation, we will get Figure 1.
Figure 1:The exact value is presented, as well as some approximate values.
As it seems, in case of 𝑛 = 4 we have the solution with six-digit accuracy.
The method is quite effective from the point of view of concurrence.

3. Calculate definite integrals using degree series.
 Computational programs in Mathematica environment.
Ask is requiredthe definite integral.
Moreover, the function 𝑓 (𝑥) can be analyzed according to the Taylor series.
By integrating member by member, we will get:Let us bring some examples.Example 1.Calculatethe integral.
 The designation √𝑥 = այդ brings this integral to the following form.from where?The row under the integral sign coincides with any ցանկացածin that case, for that reasonև Finally+ ⋯).
Such a result of a step series is commonly called a generalized step series.
 Sometimes it is more convenient to present the function in the form of a generalized order array than a regular array.
Introduce the calculation program that allows you to calculate the value of any given integral according to the presented method [7]:The first line of the program provides the input part of the data.
𝑓 (𝑥) ընդ is an integral function, − է is the point around which it is analyzedThe function, according to the Taylor series, is the number of members in the շար seriesIn the calculation process, է is the lower limit of a definite integral, and `isthe upper limit.
