1. Introduction.
  Numerical-functional series play an important role in both theoretical and applied mathematics, constituting one of the important components of the mathematical analysis of higher educational institutions in the field of mathematics, physics and technology [1].
Numerical-functional arrays are widely used in approximate calculations for calculating the values ​​of functions and calculating integrals in other problems [1,2].
Digital methods are now quite widespread և to ensure the rapid development of modern science.
Mathematica has always been regarded as the world's leading computer mathematics system.
 It provides the solution of many, multi-sectoral problems in dialog mode, while being a modern high-level programming language [3-7].
At the same time, using it as a programming environment, computational programs have been developed that allow you to calculate the values ​​of functions at given points, determine the values ​​of certain integrals, and solve differential equations.
Numerical calculations have been made, research has been carried out from the point of view of versatility.
 As a result, the effectiveness of the methods is presented using graphical elements of the Mathematica environment, making them more observational.
Solving these problems using Mathematica environment programming capabilities is relevant both from a scientific and methodological point of view.
2. Calculate the values ​​of functions through step series.
Computational programs in Mathematica environment.
 At a given point, the basis for determining the value of a function is the function according to the Taylor series analysis.
 Suppose the function 𝑦 = 𝑓 (𝑥) is given է it is necessary to determine the last value at 𝑐 =։.
 Assume that the function 𝑦 = 𝑓 (𝑥) at some point around 𝑥 = վերլուծ (containing)) satisfies the conditions of the Taylor series analysis [1], the result is that the function analysis in the series (1) allows in most cases to calculate with greater accuracy the values ​​of those functions.
Now let's introduce the calculation program in Mathematica environment, which allows you to calculate the values ​​of functions at any point using Taylor series analysis.
 It looks like this: The first line of the program provides the input part of the data.
𝑓 (𝑥) իան is the function, 𝑐 է is the point at which the value of the function is calculated, − է is the point around which the function is analyzed according to the Taylor series, and 𝑘 − is the number of stored members in the calculation process.
  The second line provides the actual calculation process.
  The last line of the program provides the output of the relevant data.
The program is presented for the case when 𝑓 (𝑥) = 𝑒 𝑥, 𝑎 = 2, 𝑐 = 2.1, 𝑘 = 5, which allows to calculate 𝑒2.1 with six-digit accuracy.
  As a result of the implementation of the program, we will get: Այստեղ է is the number of members in the Taylor series, and 𝑆 [𝑛] is the corresponding result.
 Let's visualize the obtained results graphically.
  The graphical presentation subroutine has the following view:> {Text ["S [1]", {1.0005,8.13}], Text ["S [2]", {1.0017,8.165}], Text ["exact value", {1.005,8.1720537 }]}, AxesLabel -> {, "S [n]"}, Ticks -> {None, Automatic}] As a result of the program implementation we will get Figure 1.
Figure 1 presents the exact value as well as some approximate values.
As it seems, in case of 𝑛 = 4 we have the solution with six-digit accuracy.
The method is quite effective from the point of view of concurrence.
Let us present the calculation program in the case when 𝒇 (𝒙) = 𝑺𝒊𝒏 (𝒙), 𝒂 = 𝟏, 𝒄 = 𝟏. 𝟏, 𝒌 =։, which allows 𝑺𝒊𝒏 (𝟏. 𝟏) to be counted with seven digits.
𝒇 [𝒙_].
 = 𝑺𝒊𝒏 [𝒙]; 𝒌 = 𝟓; 𝒄 = 𝟏. 𝟏; 𝒂 = 𝟏; As a result of the project implementation, we will get: Visualize the obtained results graphically (Fig. 2).
 Already 𝑛 =:
In case of 4 we have the solution with an accuracy of seven digits.
Figure 2 Present the calculation program in the case when 𝒇 (𝒙) = 𝑪𝒐𝒔 (𝒙), 𝒂 = 𝟏, 𝒄 = 𝟏. 𝟏, 𝒌 = 𝟓, which allows 𝑪𝒐𝒔 (𝟏. 𝟏) to be counted with seven decimal places.
𝒇 [𝒙_].
 = 𝑪𝒐𝒔 [𝒙]; 𝒌 = 𝟓; 𝒄 = 𝟏. 𝟏; 𝒂 = 𝟏; As a result of the project implementation, we will get: Visualize the obtained results graphically (Fig. 3).
 In this case, already in the case of 𝑛 = 4 we have the solution with an accuracy of seven digits.
Figure 3 Thus, the observed method is quite effective, the compiled program is easy to use, and the graphical representation of the results is very important from an observational point of view.
3. Calculate definite integrals using degree series.
 Computational programs in Mathematica environment.
Suppose a definite integral is required.
Moreover, the function 𝑓 (𝑥) can be analyzed according to the Taylor series.
By integrating it member by member, we will get. Let us bring some examples: Example 1. Computational integration.
 The designation √𝑥 = այդ brings that integral to the following form.
Such a result of a step series is commonly called a generalized step series.
 Sometimes it is more convenient to present the function in the form of a generalized order array than a regular array.
Introducing the calculation program, which allows you to calculate the value of any given integral according to the presented method [7]: The first line of the program provides the input part of the data.
𝑓 (𝑥) ընդ is an integral function, 𝑎 է is the point around which the function is analyzed according to the Taylor series, 𝑘 քանակ is the number of members stored in the calculation process, 𝐴 ին is the lower limit of a definite integral, and 𝐵 ` the upper limit.
 The second- third lines provide the actual calculation process.
 The last line of the program provides the relevant data.
The program is presented for the case when 𝑓 (𝑥) = 𝑒 𝑥, 𝑎 = 2, 𝑘 = 8, 𝐴 = 2, 𝐵 = 3 which allows to calculate ∫ 𝑒 𝑥𝑑𝑥
As a result of the implementation we will get: with an accuracy of six digits.
 Program ստեղ 𝑛 է is the number of Taylor members, and 𝑆 [𝑛] is the corresponding result.
 Let's visualize the obtained results graphically (Fig. 4).
 The exact value is presented, as well as some approximate values.
 As it seems, in the case of 𝑛 = 7 we have the solution with six-digit accuracy.
  The method is quite effective from the point of view of concurrence.
Present the calculation program in case 𝒇 (𝒙) =:
Figure 4 which allows you to calculate ∫
with six digits.
𝒇 [𝒙_].
 = 𝑺𝒊𝒏 [𝒙] / 𝒙; 𝒌 = 𝟏𝟏; 𝒂 = 𝟐; 𝑨 = 𝟎; 𝑩 = 𝟐; As a result of the project implementation, we will get: Visualize the obtained results graphically (Fig. 5).
  As it is, already in case of 𝑛 = 9 we have the solution with six-digit accuracy.
Figure 5 Introduce the calculation program in case 𝒇 (𝒙) =:
𝟐, 𝒌 = 𝟕, 𝑨 = 𝟎, 𝑩 = 𝟏 which allows վել to be counted
with seven digits.
𝑓 [𝑥_].
 =:
As a result of the implementation we will get: Now visualize the obtained results graphically (Fig. 6).
 We already have a fairly accurate solution in the case of 𝑛 = 25.

 Computational programs in Mathematica environment.
Now let us have the following differential equation. For which the initial conditions are set, where 𝐴, 𝐵, 𝑐, են are given numbers.
  𝑓 (𝑥) is a definite function.
 Assume that the solution is represented by a series of steps: Determine և և 𝑦 ′,, we will getThen we will analyze the function և (Թ) in the Taylor order: Place (6) - (9) (4) in the differential equation, get Equal The coefficients of the corresponding degree of `will be obtained either.
Introduce the calculation program in Mathematica environment, which allows to solve the set edge problem. The first line of the program provides the input part of the data.
𝑓 (𝑥) աջ is the right-hand side of the heterogeneous differential equation, 𝑛 է is the number of members stored in the series in the counting process.
 The second line provides a quick calculation process.
 The last line of the program provides the output of the corresponding function.
Now consider the example, the solution of which is presented in the given program.
 Suppose the edge problem has the following form. For the implementation of the program it is necessary to consider the following designations: 𝑑 = 1, 𝐴 = −2, 𝐵 = 0.
The program is implemented for 𝑛 = 10 և we will get the result: Then և, by giving տարբեր different values, for example, 2, 4, 6,8, we will get the following rows. Let's visualize the obtained results graphically (Fig. 7). Figure 7 We see that the method used in this case is also effective from the point of view of concurrence.
 Already in 𝑛 = 10 cases we have quite accurate analysis.
Consider also the following edge problem. For the implementation of the program it is necessary to consider the following designations: 𝑑 = 1, 𝐴 = −2, 𝐵 = 0.
