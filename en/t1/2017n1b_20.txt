World-renowned multi-council and multi-layeredExupery's "Little Prince" is a work summarizing knowledge.
There are various assessments that value the work in many ways in the well-known professional world.
 We will try to deliverto come up with a new approach to work analysis.
 Presenting episodes from the "Little Prince" fairy tale, we will point out the natural and ecological knowledge hidden in them.
  Humanities and natural sciencesWe offer this methodological trick of knowledge integration as:a means of promoting the teaching of natural sciences [1].
1) On the planet of the little prince, as on all other planets, there are both useful herbs and weeds.
 And this means that there are not only useful seeds of useful herbs, but also useless seeds of weeds.
 But those seeds are invisible.
They sleep deep in the ground until one of them suddenly decides to wake up, releasing a harmless sprout to the blood.
 If it isIt is a sprout of radish or rose, so let it grow as much as it wants.
 But if we are talking about weeds, we must immediately uproot the plant and remove itbuzz.
 And so, on the planet of the Little Prince, there were also harmful onesseeds….
 They were baobab seeds.
 The whole crust of the planet was infected with those seeds.
 And if you do not find the baobab in time, because of thatYou will not be free anymore!
 … If we are talking about baobabs, then delay is equal to disaster.
 I know a planet where a lazy man lived.
 He:he had neglected only three sprouts of baobar [2, p. 26].
The whole episode testifies to the fact that in all environments of the biosphere there are organisms, different in structure, function and significance, useful and "harmful", visible and invisible.whose species are manifested by reproduction.
 Particular care must be taken to prevent the rapid multiplication of pathogenic, harmful organisms. It can cause an epidemic that will be difficult to get rid of.
The second part reveals the essence of artificial selection, that those chosen in this way correspond to a human beinginterests.
 But the bottom line is that when it comes to growing plants in a given environment, you need to be guided byNot by personal interest and taste, but, as the essence of natural selection teaches, by the principle of being useful to society.
The last line can be used to show the power of multiplicationfor.
 As Vernadsky said: "There is no more powerful and powerful force on earth than the multiplication of living organisms."
 Meaning:is that in the absence of factors regulating the reproduction of the organism,Each, especially the wild, "weed" organisms, multiplying in a short time, will occupy all areas of life, pushing out the rest.
 For example, one bacterial cell will only make threeto cover the earth with its offspring, unpredictable locustsThe breeding years threaten the entire vegetation of the regionfor destruction և etc.
And the philosophy of the episode is that man is given the right to choose in diversity, which he can do either according toto taste, for personal or, consciously, public interest.
(2) The sheep eats what it sees.
 "Even thorny flowers?"
 - Yes,even thorny flowers.
 "What are thorns for?"
 - Thorns for nothingdo not need, with the help of thorns flowers just express themselvesevil.
 … - I do not believe.
 The flowers are weak.
 And they are very naive.
They try their best to be brave.
 It seems to them like thornsThey can scare everyone….
 … And isn't it a serious matter when you try to understand why they put so much effort into releasing thorns,which are not needed.
 Isn't the fight between sheep and flowers also possible?
Isn't that more serious and powerful than fat and red-faced?Mr. Convictions [2, pp. 32-34].
The phrase "serious work" in the episode can be understood as:Cognition, education, raising the level of knowledge is a symbol of value, and the addition of a fat and red-faced gentleman is a symbol of using what one knows for one's own benefit, not of value.
 Understanding the meaning of the fight between the thorns, the sheep and the flowers can be considered as the supreme human being.purpose. understanding, recognizing divine laws and perfection.
What the sheep sees, eats, the mind teaches that in natureThe connection of organisms with each other is mainly expressed in nutritionwith chains.
  And so that one species does not completely destroy anotherIn order to become food, it must have various means of protection.
Natural science knowledge is that plants, being immobile (flowers)They are weak.
 And they are very naive.
 They try their best to be braveto be destroyed by herbs, to surviveThey must have a protective device, such as a thorn or a poisonև etc.
 Fittings are acquired over a long period of timenatural organs, or by transmitting some of them, are not backwardsmay be meaningless (... to release thorns that are not needed).
3) I know a flower, a unique flower that grows only on my planet, և if suddenly a sheep's mind blows to eat that only flower in the universe:without being accountable for what he is doing, isn't that possible, huh?
 ... But:If a sheep eats this flower, it will seem to him that all the stars in the Universe have died at once.
 And in your opinion it is not possible, right? [2, pp. 34-35].
According to the fairy tale, the sheep accidentally appeared on a planet whereThat unique flower was growing.
 Having no other food source can lead to the extinction of a unique species of plant.
 The natural science of the episode is that accidental changes (such as mutations) can be dangerous to a community or any of its members.if they do not correspond to a long evolutionary periodbased on inter-species relations.
 And the nurturing potential of the episode is the formation of an environmental awareness that the existence of biodiversity in any historical area canendangered by human unconscious activity.
  "A unique flower,which grows only on my planet "information teaches the Universeon the irreplaceability of every living organism for its integrity և endemic plants, which are limited in distribution in the world, therefore, more attention by manand need protection.
 At the same time, the advice of the whole episode:Guided by personal interests, there is a strong call not to harm the planetand red-faced gentlemen.
4) On the planet of the little prince have always grown simple flowers with only a few petals.
 But this one is uniqueOne day the flower sprouted from a seed that you do not know where it came from.
 ...Appeared in the form of a seed, he knew nothing about the other planets.
 ... The little prince never left that sprout, which was not like all the other sprouts.
 It could also be an unknown type of baobab.
 But one day the growth of the bushHe stopped immediately and began to prepare to become a flower.
 The little prince felt that now, somewhere, a miracle would happen.
 But:The flower was in no hurry to get out of there.
 He carefully chose his colors.
 He slowly put on his clothes, adding his petals one by one.
 His mysterious attire was formed during the long days.
 And so, one morning, at the right dawn, he showed himself.
 ... - What!You are beautiful.
... Once, speaking of his four thorns, he said to the little prince: - Well
Now let those tigers come with their claws.
 I'm not afraid of tigers,and, alas, I am afraid of the passing wind [2, pp. 37-38].
The episode speaks of several biological patterns.
a) The seed from an unknown place can be mentioned as an example in favor of the "theory of panspermia" of the origin of life, according to which life appeared on planet Earth from other planets and space in the form of seeds, spores.
b) The information that the flower is not similar to those around it,as it's too long to get its final lookis slow to prepare, can be used to study the process of ecological species to show that a new speciesUnexpected mutation may be a prerequisite for its emergence, but species formation and development in all cases require a long evolutionary path.
c) Flower thorns are an evolutionary device acquired not to become food.
 And the fact that it is not a device for one factor (biological)can protect the body from another factor (non-biogenic - intermediatewind), indicates the relativity of the devices.
5) You should never listen to flowers.
 The flowers should look and smellpull them out.
 ... I should have formed an opinion about him, looking not at his words, but at his deeds.
 He spread fragrance around me, he lit upwas my life [2, p. 42].
a) In the episode one can find knowledge about the limitation of the morphological criterion of the species, that only by that criterion (words) one can not accurately describe the species (or any phenomenon).
 Comprehensive criteria, essence (cases) are always neededunderstand.
b) From another point of view, the episode indicates each typeuniqueness, uniqueness, how to teach that everyone should be required to define their ability, eachto evaluate the feature as a device only for certain conditions.
6) ... but since he was very tired, he yawned a little.
 "Yawning in the presence of the king is a violation of the rules of conduct," said the monarch.
 "I forbid you to yawn."
 "I'm sorry I didn't do it on purpose," said the little prince.
 - I have come a long way and I have not slept at all ...
"If so," said the king, "I command you to yawn."
 A long time agoI have not seen anyone yawn, I enjoy yawning at others.
 So yawn again.
 This is an order.
 "I'm ashamed, ... I can't either ..." he mutteredThe little prince blushed with shame.
 "Hmm, huh," murmured the kingThat's right, I order you to yawn from time to time ...
 He was an absolute monarch.
 But since he was a very kind king, only reasonable orders He was releasing.
 "If I order a general to become a seagull, if the general meIf he does not obey, then the general will not be to blame.
 I will be the culprit. "
 ... You have to demand from the person what he can do.
 If you command your peopleGo and flood the sea, he will make a revolution.
 I have the right to demand obedience because I give wise commands.
  ... MoreIt is more difficult to judge yourself than others.
 If you succeed yourselfto judge, then you are truly wise [2, pp. 48-51].
The episode is very symbolic to show the ability to regulate all the processes at any level of life formation, to learn from mistakes, from causal connections to phenomena.to study դ to cultivate an ecological attitude.
  Studying a single-celled living organism as a complex system consisting of different structures, organoids, designed to perform different functions, inevitably developsis the notion that relatively independent structures in the system are connected to each other by the most complex chains at the same time.
And in order for their mutually agreed activities to act as a unified whole, the system needs to be regulated.
 In a cell, it carries the nucleus, in a living organismnervous and humoral systems, experienced in the family, pastthe bearer of the inheritance of wisdom, the authority in the state, the divine laws in the Universe.
  And if the nucleus, the nervous systemor the manager issues wrong orders that are not in the interests of the structure,The cell dies, the organism becomes diseased, the family and the state decay, and life on the planet becomes unbalanced.
7) Getting acquainted with the constellations and planets of numbers 325-330
to the inhabitants: the monarch-king [2, p. 47], the greedy [2, p. 55], the drunkard [2, p. 58], the businessman [2, p. 60], the flashlight [2, p. 66], the research geographer [2, p. 77 ]: The little prince understood the peculiarities of different occupations, the meaning ակի of the planet (ieany environment) and its inhabitants (organisms living in that environment)the suitability of the occupation (fixtures).
 All of these chapters reveal the devices and environments of organismstheir interconnectedness and interdependence with conditions, which is one of the main ideas of the theory of evolution հիմնական the main trace of evolution.
  Only one inhabitant on each planetWe can use the fact that life is uninteresting in our presence as a means of facilitating the perception of evolutionary ideas.that uniform conditions do not ensure development, nor does the species change.
 This idea is equivalent to the essence of a stabilizing choice,according to which the species remains the same under constant conditions,without changing the level of formation.
 And the general conclusion to be drawn from all this is that the most important meaning of human life is the perception of the perfection of creation, which no planet has.It is not typical for a single resident, because such a consciousness can be reachedOnly due to the diversity of devices, biodiversityWhen it comes to wonder.
  This is the educational potential of the students of the episode.
8) Provide environmental education
he և The thoughts of the geographer.
  The physical he pointed outworld values ​​(or abiotic factors): rock, mountain,The oceans are eternal, և man can not eliminate them, and flowers are biotic factors that are transient, can change or disappear altogether due to human error.
 RareIt happens that the mountain changes its place.
 It is rare for the ocean to dry up.
And can the flower disappear in the near future ... because it is transient? [2, page 75].
9) The seventh planet was Earth.
 There are 111 kings there (of course,we count the kings of slaughter), 7000 geographers, 900000businessman, 7.5 million drunkards, 311 million ambitious, that is, about two billionan adult.
 ... On all six continents they were forced to maintain a huge army of flashlights consisting of 462,511 people.
 Flashlights can be compared to producers in the ecosystem (producers of phototrophs or plants), which are the primary food for life in other parts of the system in light conditions, andThey produce oxygen.
 By the same logic they can be comparedwith the intellectuals, teachers, and philosophers who organized education before the birth of science.
 With that pointingWe will explore the role of knowledge and education for the development of the individual and humanity.
 Until they discovered electricity on Earth,there, on all six continents, they were forced to maintain a huge army of 462511 flashlights [2, p. 76].
 And directly, this idea points to the planet Earth before scienceThe discovery of artificial light, the only source of natural light in the skyThere were light fixtures.
10) The continuation of the episode summarizes a lot of geography
Interesting information about the six continents of the planet Earthabout different time zones and their correct sequence.
 First stageNew Zealand and Australia, then China and Siberia, then Russia and India, then Africa and Europe, then South America, and finally North America.
 And they never broke the order of appearing on stage.
 Only the lanterns of the only lanterns of the North and South Poles lived a quiet life. they were going to work
twice a year [2, pp. 76-77].
 The last thought teaches periodicallyThe important knowledge about the phenomena is that the loads are in the middle of the year during the dayThe other half is at night.
  And the listed sequence of countries coincides with the natural science knowledge that the dawn is first metIn Australia, New Zealand, then in the order listed in the episode, and finally in the North American state of Alaska.
11) The little prince looked at the roses, all the roses were like his flower.
 ... His flower said that there is no flower like him in the whole universe.
 And:here, in one garden alone, there were 5,000 flowers like it ... [2, p. 87].
This episode (as in point 4) can be used for the origin of lifeWhen explaining the essence of the theory of panspermia, according to which:The seeds of life fell to planet Earth from outer space(here, only in one park ...).
12) You are just a little boy to me, you are no different from the other 100,000 little boys.
 I do not need you.
 You need me tooYou do not have it.
 ... But if you get used to me, we will need each other.
 Me:You will be the only one in the whole world.
 I will be the only one for youIn the whole world....
 ... You are forever responsible for all of themfor whom you have trained [2, p. 91; 97].
  To leave the meaning of the episodeIt can be compared to natural and artificial selection, emphasizing the cultivation compared to wild species in nature.Dependence of plant varieties, pet breeds on human care.
 This combination of art and knowledge has a powerful potential for nurturing what each one doesfor the formation of a sense of responsibility towards.
"Please train me," said the fox.
 "I would gladly get used to it," said the little prince, "but I have very little time now."
 And in order to get used to it, you have to be very patient [2, page 93].
 This episode tooproves that the emergence of cultivated plants and pets is the result of a long evolutionary process.
This is where, in our opinion, one of the main mysteries of the fairy tale is summarized. to love one's neighbor, enduring various trials
to keep close ones, or to take responsibility for all those whom you have trained.
 This makes it very emotional to understand the important point of environmental thinking thatPreservation of biodiversity is a condition for ensuring the stability of life.
