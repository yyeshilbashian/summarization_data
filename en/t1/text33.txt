The history of 20th century typography is one of the least studied ancient problems of Armenian historiography.
  This also refers to the printing history of the First Republic of Armenia.
  Soviet-Armenian scholars did not make the books published during the Republic of Armenia a separate issue for study.
  Meanwhile, only from the study of the bibliographic lists "Armenian Book in 1901-1920" and "Armenian Book in 1921-1930" published by the National Library of Armenia in the last decade, we see that in the conditions of lack of paper and deplorable state of printing during the First Republic (we also mean Nagorno-Karabakh ) About sixty books have been published1.
  This is also not an accurate data.
 Let us not forget that in the mentioned bibliographic lists only the Armenian language literature is reflected, and the bibliographic lists of Russian language literature published in Armenia are not compiled, the Russian language books have not been studied.
  We can assure that in 1918-1921. A certain number of published books and newspapers have not been preserved in RA libraries and centers abroad, due to which the bibliographic lists of the NMA are not complete.
  While researching in the National Archives of Armenia, we came across a study that was not included in the above-mentioned lists.
 The Armenian book in 1901-1920, compiled by O. Gyulumyan, A. Adamyan, S. Tadevosyan, A. Savalyan, M. Soghomonyan, A. Sahakyan, Yerevan, 2007, p. 563624, The Armenian book in 1921-1930, compiled by O. Gyulumyan, S. Grigoryan, Yerevan, 2012, pp. 1-22.
 426 HISTORY Book information.
  Thus. One of the documents found by us contains information about 1924. December 1919 in the Revolutionary Museum of Armenia On the existence of a book entitled "Mourning Aram" published in Yerevan 2, which was dedicated to the memory of the de facto founder of the Republic of Armenia, the first Minister of Internal Affairs Aram Manukyan (1879-1919).
  The mentioned edition is not only not available in RA libraries now, but is also not mentioned in the bibliographic lists of the Armenian book.
 1918 After Armenia's independence in May 1945, the government announced a democratic approach to printing and press policy.
  In this field, the progressive legal acts of the All-Russian Provisional Government were applied in the Republic of Armenia for the given time.
  However, the authorities did not always follow through on their obligations.
 The publishing sphere in the RA was under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
  On behalf of the government, the Ministry of Internal Affairs maintained relations with the printing houses and newspaper editorial offices, gave instructions to them, allowed or stopped the publication of the press, the distribution of books, and controlled that the printing houses did not print anti-government, destructive calls and leaflets.
  However, the precautionary measures were not always successful.
 We do not know any obvious facts about the control and censorship of printing by the state during the first months of the republic's independence (until the spring of 1919).
  However, the situation changed along with the stabilization of the internal situation in the Republic of Armenia and, especially, the 1919 National Archive of Armenia (NAA), f. 122, c. 1, c. 259 118 and around.

 427 HISTORY In the run-up to the June 21-23 parliamentary elections and in the following months, when there was an active struggle between the political parties.
 1919 On May 26, the Government of the Republic of Armenia authorized the Minister of Internal Affairs to confiscate paper and printing houses if necessary for the work of the Central Electoral Commission organizing the Parliamentary elections4.
  Most likely, this was conditioned by the fact that a number of political forces (Armenian People's Party, Armenian Social Democrats, Bolsheviks) boycotted the parliamentary elections.
  The leaders of the Republic of Armenia were afraid that the owners or workers of the printing houses might organize a surprise strike, failing to print the ballots.
  The storage of the necessary paper was also an important issue.
  Let's prove. 1918-1920 There was an acute need for paper, the paper was included in the list of goods, the export of which was prohibited from the Republic of Armenia5.
 Examination of archival and published documents, press and memoirs shows that the examples of "forbidden literature" in the Republic of Armenia are of a political nature.
  Most of them refer to the publications of the Armenian Bolsheviks.
 The point is that the Armenian Bolsheviks preferred the unrealistic prospects of the class struggle they perceived to national interests and aspirations.
  1919 In the summer of 1918, the activities of the young Bolsheviks in Armenia caused indignation among the Armenian authorities, the military and the population.
 Note that in 1919 The "Spartak" Union of Young Socialist-Internationalists was established in Yerevan in April 2006. In May, it was renamed the "Spartak" Organization of the Young Communists of Yerevan (Chairman: Ghukas Ghukasyan, Secretary: Aghasi Khanjyan).

 428 HISTORY secretly printed two anti-government leaflets in the streets of Yerevan, in military units, among the urban and rural population of the republic.
 The first leaflet was distributed on the eve of the June 21-23 parliamentary elections.
  The mentioned system criticized the state system and parties of "bourgeois" Armenia.
  It ended like this. "Lose imperialism, lose parliamentarism, long live the Soviet power, long live communism" 6.
  The members of "Spartak" distributed the next leaflet in July, when the Armenian army was engaged in suppressing the Turkish-Tatar anti-state riots in the Beyuk-Vedi region.
  The leaflet, the author of which was the well-known revolutionary Arshavir Melikyan, called on the Armenian soldiers to fight against the authorities of the republic instead of obeying the orders of the military command and fighting against the "Turkish working brothers" 7.
 The last call had a great response.
  If the previous one was ignored by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, this time two dozen members of "Spartak" were arrested and imprisoned for several days.
  Two of the young men, Aghasi Khanjyan and Harutyun Hasratyan, remained in prison for about two months, until, as Interior Minister A. Gyulkhandanyan noted a few months later, "they were guilty, they regretted what they had done and signed that they would not take any such anti-state step."
 The next known example is 1919. The resolution "On the Political Moment" adopted at the second congress of the Armenian People's Party held in Yerevan on September 9-16, 2012, which strongly criticized the Armenian authorities and the ruling Spartak. 1917-1920, memoirs and documents, Yerevan, 1935, pp. 174-177.

  It is clear that in the memoirs written about these events years later, A. Khanjyan "forgot" to mention sin (Spartak. 1917-1920, memoirs and documents, pp. 18-19).
 429 HISTORY of the party - H. Յ. Dashnaktsutyun, activities and demand to dissolve the RA parliament and government.
  The resolution was reproduced in the form of a leaflet in the Luys printing house of the city (the official newspaper of the People's Party "Zhoghovurd" was also published here) and was distributed, causing dissatisfaction among the authorities.
  By the order of the Minister of Internal Affairs Abraham Gyulkhandanyan, on the morning of September 19, the editorial office of "Zhoghovurd" newspaper was searched and the printed copies of the Resolution were confiscated.
  The Luys printing house was also closed.
  Then the Minister of Internal Affairs issued a special order to the manager of the printing house not to print "anti-government letters" 9.
  The printing house reopened only after the printing house owner signed an agreement not to publish anti-government materials.
  The publication of "Zhoghovurd" newspaper resumed on September 2410.
  This was an unprecedented fact of brutal control over the publishing sector during the time of the Republic of Armenia, which fundamentally contradicted the letter and spirit of the government application that carried out that order.
 The Armenian authorities were particularly concerned about the spread of anti-state literature by the Armenian Bolsheviks.
 1919 On September 9, the RA Government appointed the Minister of Internal Affairs A. He instructed Gyulkhandanyan to work out a bill on deporting "harmful elements" from Armenia11.
  The point is that especially in 1919. Armenian communists persecuted in Georgia and Azerbaijan have been moving to Armenia since the spring of 2007, looking for fertile ground for their activities in the Armenian state, where there was no persecution for party affiliation.
  The activity of the Bolsheviks in the republic gained new momentum in 1919. The first "Voice of Armenia" of the communist organizations of Armenia held in Yerevan on September 22, 1919, N 1, NAA, f. 201, c. 1, c. 39, թ. 113.

 430 HISTORY After the consultation, when the Committee of the Republic of Armenia (Armencom) was established12.
 By the assignment of the RA Government, the Ministry of Internal Affairs in 1919 December 1920 In February, he arrested a number of active Bolsheviks in Yerevan, Alexandropol and Dilijan (Sargis Kasyan, Askanaz Mravyan, Nikolay Panfilov, Sargis Khanoyan, Hayk Yagubyan, Mushegh Aghayan and others).
  The issue of those arrested at the suggestion of the Socialist-Revolutionary faction was discussed in detail in the 1920 resolution of the Armenian Parliament. at the February 20 sitting.
  The transcript of the session shows that the detainees were accused of distributing "criminal literature", campaigning in the army and distributing leaflets, and cooperating with the Turks13.
 That "criminal literature" was the booklet "Where is the way out" authored by the well-known Armenian Bolshevik Sargis Kasyan, which the latter, "S. Under the pseudonym "Atenyan", on the instructions of the RC (B) K Committee of Armenia, he secretly published a small edition in 1919. in December.
  On the initiative of the Armenian Bolshevik figures of the North Caucasus in 1920. It is republished with a short preface by the famous Bolshevik Sargis Lukashin (Srapionyan) 14.
 The book described the difficult socio-economic situation in the republic, the abuses committed, the internal and foreign policy of the Government was sharply criticized.
  The way out of the current situation was considered to be the reversal and sovietization of the Republic of Armenia to the north (Soviet Russia) 15.
  By the way, after the sovietization of Armenia in 1922, the booklet in the series "Workers 'and Peasants' Library" was republished in Yerevan.

 431 HISTORY As for Armencom's leaflet that angered the Armenian authorities, the reason for its creation was the 1920 The de facto recognition of Armenia's independence by the Supreme Council of the Allies on January 19 in Paris.
 It was received with joy in Yerevan and was celebrated with great pomp16.
  The mentioned leaflet held the idea that the independence of the Republic of Armenia seemed to be, the workers and peasants of Armenia would have real independence only after the establishment of the Soviet rule of law in Armenia with the help of the Red Army of Soviet Russia.
  It ended with the following calls: "Long live the Red Army, long live Soviet Russia, long live Soviet Armenia, death to the leeches and enemies of the people, long live socialism."
 1920 After the outbreak of the anti-government uprising of the Armenian Bolsheviks in early May, the state tightened its control over the printing presses.
  At the May 6 sitting of the RA Bureau-Government, it was decided to reserve the issue of confiscation of printing houses in the territory of the republic, control over them and their use to the discretion of the Minister of Internal Affairs18.
  Moreover, the RA Ministry of Internal Affairs appointed special commissioners to establish control over the printing houses.
  Thus. Assistant to the Minister S. By Torosyan's May 8 order, member of parliament, ARF member Enovk Mirakyan was appointed commissioner of Yerevan and Etchmiadzin printing houses.
  On May 15, Sargis Poghosyan replaced the latter19.
  From the point of view of the struggle against the Bolshevik literature, these steps yielded some results.
 There was a sharp demand for professional books in Armenia.
  The matter reached the point that the RA government, in 1920 Discussing the Armenian history of legal books from the country at the July 7 sitting, vol. IV, book I, Yerevan, 2010, pp. 152-153.

 432 HISTORY The issue of banning the export was decided to ban the export of all kinds of professional books20.
 In fact, S. Kasyan's book "Where is the way out" and the leaflets of the Armenian Bolsheviks against the independent statehood of the Republic of Armenia were banned in the Republic of Armenia, and those who distributed them were arrested.
  The other example was the copy of the PPA "On the Political Moment" resolution in the form of a leaflet.
  As we see, we can only speak conditionally about the literature banned during the RA, especially books.
  The existing partial cases, with one exception, are mainly related to the government's efforts to neutralize the anti-state steps taken by the Armenian Bolsheviks to overthrow the state.
