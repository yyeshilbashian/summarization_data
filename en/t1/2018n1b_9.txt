Timeliness.
  Athlete's weight in sports activitiesRegulation is one of the most important components of effective competition.
  In martial arts, where it existshave weight classes, weight regulation is mainly definedwith a reduction in body weight, therefore acting in different weight categoriesMost athletes want to lose weight.
Weight loss will be followed by fatigue and constant tiredness.high achievements [2].
The results of studies conducted within the framework of this topic show that the effect of weight regulation on the body is very individual.
 Therefore, athletes must clearly realize ևproperly assess their capabilities to weight managementcontributes to the efficiency of competitive activity.
Purpose.
  To study Armenian Greco-Roman wrestlersModern approaches to weight management.
Problems.
  1) Explain the wrestling weight control options.
2) Identify the impact of weight management on competitive activity.
Methods.
  During the study, they were used to study, analyze and generalize scientific and methodological literature.sociological survey, study of competitive activity ևMethods of mathematical statistics.
10 weightlifters took part in the poll73 wrestlers of the categories, 43 of whom were masters of sports, և 6 - masters of sports of international class.
  Among them were the three-time Olympic and world champion Arthur Aleksanyan, the vice-champion of the Olympic Games, the world champion Arsen Julfalakyan, the world champion Maxim Manukyan, as well as the athletes who won prizes in the youth championships.places.
The average sports experience of the respondents was 10 years, andThe average age was 21 years old.
• To our question: “If you regulate your body weight from competitionsforward, how do you do it? ”52% of respondents answered:"Limiting food and water intake to exercise"Providing plenty of sweat, using a sauna, massage, other aids", 34% said, "limitingfood և water intake ապահով ensuring heavy sweating during training ”, while the other options համ combinations of options showed a small percentage.
Choosing the right weight management method is very important.because, according to the literature, body weight is too much or too wrongReducing the method can reduce the athlete's activity during the march, the frequency of tricks used և variability [1].
• The question we are interested in: “If you are reducing your bodyweight before the competition, then by how many kg? ”36% of the respondents chose“ 2kg "version, 27% -" 3 kg "version, 4, 5 և 6 kg versions received a relatively low percentage, and 14% of athletes stated that" noreduces body weight.
This issue has received a lot of attention from us since:According to the data available in the professional literature [3] bodyWeight loss of more than 7% can lead to a decline in the body's ability to work, and up to 7% in generalStimulates the athlete's systems that ensure the preparation of the most economical, reliable technical-tactical actions.
To the question, "If you lose weight from competition?"forward, then how long do you do it?59% answered "the last one of the pre-competition period32% said "within the last 2 days" and 9% answered"It starts to decrease a month before the competition."
According to the literature, in the lightweight categories of the bodyIt is advisable to lose weight in a short period of time,and weightlifters need to lose more weightin the long run, because heavyweights have more difficulty losing the same relative weight, and the more time an athlete has at his disposal, the easier it is to get rid of "excess" weight due to the fat component.
• The next question is “What is the effect of weight loss?On your well-being ", we got the following image. Athletes:
68% answered, "My level of functional abilities is increasing", 14% said, "I am becoming irritable", և "It is increasingmy level of functionality ", 10% chose" FeelingI lack energy ", and in the other versions 4% of the answers were registered.
This question has been asked because of weight lossAthletes who are overly obsessed often not only sufferwith insomnia and irritability, but many famous athletescomplain about their health after finishing their sports career,complains of this or that disease of the gastrointestinal tract.
• We considered it necessary to clarify "What is the effect of weight loss on athletes' technical and tactical98% of the respondents answered that "offensive-defensive actions become more effective", և only 2% answered that "offensive-defensive actions become more slow-ineffective".
This is a rather happy fact. It is known that as a result of weight loss, the absolute index of muscle strength undergoes a significant change, which is the basis for the manifestation of the body's mobility, in general, motor abilities.
• Can we consider finding out, “What effect does it have?weight loss on the efficiency of competitive activity. "
  This:To the question, 12% of wrestlers said "sometimes", 36% - "mostly", and 48% -It "always" has a positive effect, և only 4% of respondentsto mention its negative impact.
The latter may be due to the fact that athletes, realizing the peculiarities of their own body, their abilities, mainly organize weight correctly and effectively.the settlement process.
CONCLUSION.
  We came to it as a result of a sociological surveyThe conclusion is that most of our wrestlers weigh in before the competitionRegulates abundant exercise, sauna use, of courseby maintaining the diet, mainly in the last pre-competition week և during the last 2 days.
Thus, our study reaffirmed the data available in the professional literature on weight management, according to which weight management is an integral part of competitive activity in martial arts, thereforeWe suggest paying more attention to this issue during lectures and professional trainingsto modern approaches.
