Introduction.
Definition.
 The correspondence between the set X of the set Y, where each element of the set X corresponds to only one element of the set Y, is called a function.
Fig. 1:
The set X is called the domain of the function, and the set Y is the domain of its values.
After the definition, the function is given if:1. The domain of his (X) decision is given.
2. The range of its (Y) values ​​is given.
3. The rule of compliance (law) is known.
A function is called numeric if the elements of the set X և Y are numbers.
If the numerical function is given analytically [in the form of the formula Y = f (x)], չէ its decision range is not indicated, then that range is consideredis the set of real values ​​of the argument for which f (x)The expression is a real number.
QUESTION. And how to determine the range of values?
The range of values ​​of the function մի Several methods of determinationYou need good to find the range of values ​​of the functionto know the basic properties of elementary functions.
The task of finding the range of values ​​of a function is more complicatedbased on exercises: 1. Evaluation method
2. to enter a parameter,
3. Inverse function method
4. the largest և smallest method of the function,
5. Graphic
6. on the method of applying known inequalities.
1) The evaluation method can be used mainly when:
The independent variable is in one expression or it canto make it look like that.
 Evaluation range of function valuesto find. 1) we write TAB
2) Starting from the TAB, taking appropriate steps
constraints on expressions, we get a functionappearance in the range of its values.
 Example 1.

1 + 𝑥2 function, find the range of values ​​[1].
Solution (evaluation method).
The domain for determining a function is x 𝑅 𝑅.
Image: 𝐸 (𝑓) = (0,100]Example 2.
 Find the range of values ​​of the function 𝑦 = 1 - 𝑐𝑜𝑠3𝑥 [5] ․ 𝐸 (1 - 𝑐𝑜𝑠3𝑥) = [0,2].
Example 3.
  Find the largest integer value of the function [5].
      Answer: [0,2]Answer: 8.
Example 4.
 Find the largest integer value of the function [7].
Find the largest value of the function 𝑔 (𝑡):𝑔 (𝑡) = 5𝑡, where 𝑡 = 2𝑠𝑖𝑛2𝑥 + 5𝑐𝑜𝑠2𝑥 - 1:[5> 1] և 2𝑠𝑖𝑛2𝑥 + 5𝑐𝑜𝑠2𝑥 - 1 = 2 (1-𝑐𝑜𝑠2𝑥) + 5𝑐𝑜𝑠2𝑥 - 1 = 3𝑐𝑜𝑠2𝑥 + 1Example 5.
  Find the smallest value of the expression [5].
Answer: 1250We have:.
That is, the smallest value of the given expression is 3.
Now find x:In the case of the values ​​of x obtained, the expression is not determined,since the denominator is equal to 0.
 Following the given expression:The smallest value is 4.
Answer: 4.
Example 6.
  Find the range of values ​​of the E (y) function of the functionby the method of finding complex arguments sequentially [5].
𝑦 = 𝑙𝑜𝑔0.5 (4 - 2 ∙ 3𝑥 + 9𝑥).
Let's change the function:𝑦 = 𝑙𝑜𝑔0.5 (5 - (1 + 2 ∙ 3𝑥 + 32𝑥)) = 𝑙𝑜𝑔0.5 (5 - (1 + 3𝑥) 2).
𝐸 (3𝑥) = (0. + ∞).
𝐸 (3𝑥 + 1) = (1. + ∞).
𝐸 (- (3𝑥 + 1) 2) = (−∞; −1).
𝐸 (5 - (3𝑥 + 1) 2) = (−∞; 4).
Let's appoint: 5 - (3𝑥 + 1) 2 = 𝑡, where 𝑡 ∈ (−∞; 4).
We get: 𝑦 = 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑜, 5𝑡, where {
 retroactively ∈ ∈ (0; 4).
In the range (0; 4) the function is continuous և decreasing𝑡 = 4 => 𝑦 = 𝑙𝑜𝑔0.54 = −2.
We got: 𝐸 (𝑦) = (−2; + ∞).
Answer: (−2; + ∞).
Note that it was not necessary to find an exercise solutionthe scope of the initial function, but this problem could not be completely bypassed during the solution of the example.
Example 7.
 Find the range of values ​​of the function 𝑦 = 𝑐𝑜𝑠7𝑥 + 5𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑥 [6].
Let's solve it by evaluation method.
Because the summable functions have their largest և smallest accept values ​​at the same points, then ∈ ∈ [−6; 6].
 Answer: 𝑦 ∈ [−6; 6].
Example 8.
  Find the largest և smallest values ​​of a functionon [5].
 Solve the equation:).
Consider the left part:Consider the right part:The left-right parts are equal when both parts are equal to 2:           Answer: 𝑥 = 0.42) To find the range of values ​​of a function in a parametric way, we consider the function as a parameter: b, և The problem leads to the determination of the values ​​of the parameter, in which case the equation f (x) = b hassolution.
 Example 9.
  Given 𝑓 (𝑥) =:
9 + 𝑥2 function, find the range of values ​​[1].
Solution (method of entering a parameter).
   Example 10.
  For what values ​​of parameter a √𝑥 + 5 = 𝑎 (𝑥2 + 4)The equation has a single root in the range [-4; -1] [6].
Solve using the continuity of the function և monotonicity.
Answer: [-
].
In the interval [-4; -1] the function 𝑦 = 𝑥2 + 4 is continuous, decreasing և positive, then 𝑔 (𝑥) =
Is constantly growing in that range.
ℎ (𝑥) = √𝑥 + 5 The function is continuously increasing և in its decision range:𝐷 (ℎ) = [−5; + ∞) և in particular in the range [-4; -1], where it և
It is positive.
Thus 𝑓 (𝑥) = 𝑔 (𝑥) ℎ ℎ (𝑥) is continuously in the [increasing [-4; -1] interval,therefore the range of values ​​in the range [-4; -1] is [𝑓 (−4); 𝑓 (−1)] =:
[0.05; 0,4], consequently when 𝑎 ∈ [0,05; 0.4] equation in the range [-4; -1]
has the only solution.
Answer: 𝑎 ∈ [0.05; 0.4]
Example 11.
 Find 𝑓 (x) =:
 the range of values ​​of the function.
Let's solve it by entering a parameter.
Let's make an appointmenta) when 𝑎 = 2, the function becomes linear: −4𝑥 - 5 = 0, which has a solution.
b) when 𝑎 ≠ 2, the function is quadratic ունի has a solution when D≥ 0 <=>
a) և b) from the combination of solutions we get: E (f) = [
].
Answer: [
].
3) Inverse function method.
The indirect function method can be used to find the range of values ​​as an indirect application of the parameter input method [6].
In this case, the equation f (x) = y (depending on x) must be solved, where:y is a parameter.
 If this equation has only one solution x = g (y), then E (f)The range of values ​​corresponds to the decision D (g) of the inverse function g (y)to the domain.
 And if f (x) = y has several solutions: x = g1 (y), x = g2 (y) և etc., then E (f) = g1 (y), g2 (y), միավոր union of decision domains.
Example 12.
      𝑦 = 5:
Determination range: D (x).
<=> 𝐷 (𝑥) = (0,1) ∪ (25, + ∞).
Answer: (0,1) ∪ (25, + ∞)4) The method of the largest և smallest values ​​of the function is possible
find the value ranges of the functions whose domain is the definitionis closed, և the function is always in that range.
In this case the question is brought in the closed domain given to find the largest և smallest value of the function.
Example 13.
 Find the range of values ​​of the function 𝑓 (𝑥) = √11 - 𝑥 + √𝑥 - 3 [1].
Solution (method of finding the largest, smallest).
    Since the function 𝐷 (𝑓) = [3,11] is a closed domain, the question is closedto find the largest and smallest function of a continuous domain.
𝑓 ′ (𝑥) = 0 √𝑥 √𝑥 - 3 = √11 - 𝑥, hence 𝑥 = 7 ∈ 𝐷 (𝑓)𝐸 (𝑓) = [√8, 4].
Answer: [√8, 4].
5) Graphically determine the values ​​of those functions
domain whose graphs are conveniently constructed for shifts orbased on the properties of the function.
Example 4 (graphic method).
 Find 𝑓 (𝑥) = 𝑥 | 𝑥 - 4 |: The range of values ​​of the function [1].
𝑓 (𝑥) = 𝑥2 - 4𝑥 = (𝑥 - 2) 2 - 4 or {
Answer: (−∞, ∞)6) Using known inequalities, we determine the value ranges of the functions in which it is possible to obtain the largest or smallest values ​​by using known inequalities.
  Largest և smallest example of a function Example 10.
  Find 𝑦 =:
jacks, where 𝑎, 𝑏> 0 [4].
Note that: When x <0, then f (x) <0When x> 0, then f (x)> 0When x = 0, then f (x) = 0Hence, the function f (x) assumes its greatest valueis in the range (0; + ∞), and the smallest value is in the range (-∞; 0).
The first method.
  How do we know for numbers 𝑎𝑥2::?≥ | 𝑥 |: ∙ √𝑎𝑏, where the equation occurs when 𝑎𝑥2 = b.
When x> 0,, it follows that the largest value of the function f (x) is equalwhich accepts 𝑥 = √ 𝑏
 at the point.
 SinceThe function f (x) is odd, so its smallest value is equal to -
  of,which assumes the function f (x) 𝑥 = 𝑏 𝑏
 at the point.
The second method.
  The function f (x) overlaps (0; + ∞) is 𝑔 (𝑥) =:
    to the function where 𝑎, 𝑏> 0.
  This feature is greatwill take the value when h (x) = 𝑎𝑥 +
    the function accepts itsthe lowest value.
Because 𝑎𝑥 ∙
= 𝑎𝑏 is constant, then 𝑎𝑥 +
   accepts the moneythe smallest value when 𝑎𝑥 =
, that is, when 𝑥 = √𝑏
 .
So we get that the function f (x) is the largest in the range (0; + ∞)the value is 𝑥 = √𝑏
  at the point և it is equal to       Find the smallest value of the function f (x) in the first methodby analogy.
Example 11.
 Find the largest value of the xyz product if it is known that:x, y, z> 0 և 2x + √3y + 𝜋z = 1 [4].
From the condition 2x + √3y + 𝜋z = 1, we get 𝑥 =
, where the equation will occur when using 2𝑥 = √3𝑦 = 𝜋z: .
