Introduction.
Definition.
 The correspondence between the set X of the set Y, where each element of the set X corresponds to only one element of the set Y, is called a function.
Fig. The set 1X is called the domain of the function, and the set Y is called the range of its values.
It follows from the definition that the function is given if: 1. The domain of his (X) decision is given.
2. The range of its (Y) values ​​is given.
3. The rule of compliance (law) is known.
A function is called numeric if the elements of the set X և Y are numbers.
If the numerical function is given analytically [in the form of the formula Y = f (x)], its domain is not specified, then that domain is considered to be the set of real values ​​of the argument for which the expression f (x) is a real number.
QUESTION. And how to determine the range of values?
Function Value Range քանի Several Determination Methods To find the function value range, it is necessary to improve the basic properties of elementary functions.
The problem of finding the range of values ​​of a function is based on the most complex exercises: 1. evaluation method;
2. to enter a parameter,
3. Inverse function method
4. the largest և smallest method of the function,
5. Graphic
6. on the method of applying known inequalities.
1) The evaluation method can be used mainly when:
The independent variable is in one expression or can be brought to that form.
 To find the range of values ​​of the function by evaluation method. 1) we write TAB
2) Starting from the TAB, taking appropriate steps
the constraints of expressions, we get the object of the function with its range of values.
 Example 1.
    Given: 𝑓 (𝑥) =:
1 + 𝑥2 function, find the range of values ​​[1].
Solution (evaluation method).
The domain for determining a function is x 𝑅 𝑅.
Image: 𝐸 (𝑓) = (0,100] Example 2.
 Find the range of values ​​of the function 𝑦 = 1 - 𝑐𝑜𝑠3𝑥 [5] ․ 𝐸 (1 - 𝑐𝑜𝑠3𝑥) = [0,2].
Example 3.
  Find the largest integer value of the function [5].
      Answer: [0,2] Answer: 8.
Example 4.
 Find the largest integer value of the function [7].
Find the largest value of the function 𝑔 (𝑡): 𝑔 (𝑡) = 5𝑡, where 𝑡 = 2𝑠𝑖𝑛2𝑥 + 5𝑐𝑜𝑠2𝑥 - 1 [5> 1] և 2𝑠𝑖𝑛2𝑥 + 5𝑐𝑜𝑠2𝑥 - 1 = 2 (1-𝑐𝑜𝑠2𝑥) + 5𝑐𝑜𝑠2𝑥 - 1 = 3𝑐𝑜𝑠2𝑥 + 1 Example 5.
  Find the smallest value of the expression [5].
Answer: 1250 We have:
That is, the smallest value of the given expression is 3.
Now find x: In the case of the values ​​of x, the expression is not determined because the denominator is equal to 0.
 The smallest value of the given expression is 4.
Answer: 4.
Example 6.
  Find the range of values ​​of the function E (y) by sequentially finding the complex arguments of the function [5].
𝑦 = 𝑙𝑜𝑔0.5 (4 - 2 ∙ 3𝑥 + 9𝑥).
Let's change the function: 𝑦 = 𝑙𝑜𝑔0.5 (5 - (1 + 2 ∙ 3𝑥 + 32𝑥)) = ,50.5 (5 - (1 + 3𝑥) 2).
𝐸 (3𝑥) = (0. + ∞).
𝐸 (3𝑥 + 1) = (1. + ∞).
𝐸 (- (3𝑥 + 1) 2) = (−∞; −1).
𝐸 (5 - (3𝑥 + 1) 2) = (−∞; 4).
Let 5 - (3𝑥 + 1) 2 = 𝑡, where ∈ ∈ (−∞; 4).
We get: 𝑦 = 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑜, 5𝑡, where {
 retroactively ∈ ∈ (0; 4).
In the range (0; 4) the function is continuous և decreasing𝑡 = 4 => 𝑦 = 𝑙𝑜𝑔0,54 = −2.
We got: 𝐸 (𝑦) = (−2; + ∞).
Answer: (−2; + ∞).
Note that for solving the exercise it was not necessary to find the range of determination of the initial function, but during the solution of the example it was not possible to completely bypass that problem.
Example 7.
 Find the range of values ​​of the function 𝑦 = 𝑐𝑜𝑠7𝑥 + 5𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑥 [6].
Let's solve it by evaluation method.
Since the summable functions assume their largest և smallest values ​​at the same points, 𝑦 ∈ [−6; 6].
 Answer: 𝑦 ∈ [−6; 6].
Example 8.
  For finding the largest և smallest values ​​of a function [5].
 Solve the equation:).
Consider the left part: Consider the right part: Left և The right parts are equal when both parts are equal to 2: Answer: 𝑥 = 0.42) The problem leads to the determination of the parameter values, in which case the equation f (x) = b is dissolved.
 Example 9.
  Given 𝑓 (𝑥) =:
9 + 𝑥2 function, find the range of values ​​[1].
Solution (method of entering a parameter).
   Example 10.
  For what values ​​of the parameter a does the equation √𝑥 + 5 = 𝑎 (𝑥2 + 4) have a single root in the range [-4; -1] [6].
Solve using the continuity of the function և monotonicity.
Answer: [-
].
In the interval [-4; -1] the function 𝑦 = 𝑥2 + 4 is continuous, decreasing և positive, then 𝑔 (𝑥) =
Is constantly growing in that range.
ℎ (𝑥) = √𝑥 + 5 The function is continuously increasing և in its domain 𝐷 (ℎ) = [[5; + ∞) և in particular in the range [-4; -1], where it is positive.
Thus, 𝑓 (𝑥) = 𝑔 (𝑥) ∙ ℎ (𝑥) is continuously in the և increasing [-4; -1] interval, therefore the range of values ​​in the interval [-4; -1] is: [𝑓 (−4); 𝑓 (−1)] =:
[0.05; 0,4], consequently when 𝑎 ∈ [0,05; 0,4] equation is a solution of the range [-4; -1], moreover, the only one.
Answer: 𝑎 ∈ [0.05; 0.4] Example 11.
 Find 𝑓 (x) =:
 the range of values ​​of the function.
Let's solve it by entering a parameter.
Meaning) when 𝑎 = 2, the function becomes linear: −4𝑥 - 5 = 0, which has a solution.
b) when 𝑎 ≠ 2, the function is quadratic ունի has a solution when D≥ 0 <=>
a) և b) from the combination of solutions we get: E (f) = [
].
Answer: [
].
3) Inverse function method.
The indirect function method can be used to find the range of values ​​as an indirect application of the parameter input method [6].
In this case, the equation f (x) = y (depending on x) must be solved, where y is a parameter.
 If this equation has only one solution x = g (y), then the range of values ​​E (f) coincides with the determinant D (g) of the inverse function g (y).
 And if f (x) = y has several solutions: x = g1 (y), x = g2 (y) և etc., then E (f) = g1 (y), g2 (y),… is the union of the decision domains.
Example 12.
      𝑦 = 5:
Determination range: D (x).
<=> 𝐷 (𝑥) = (0,1) ∪ (25, + ∞).
Answer: (0,1) ∪ (25, + ∞) 4) By the method of the largest և smallest values ​​of the function we can
find the value ranges of the functions whose decision range is closed,։ the function is continuous in that range.
In this case the question is brought in the closed domain given to find the largest և smallest value of the function.
Example 13.
 Find the range of values ​​of the function 𝑓 (𝑥) = √11 - 𝑥 + √𝑥 - 3 [1].
Solution (method of finding the largest, smallest).
    Since the function 𝐷 (𝑓) = [3,11] is a closed domain, the problem is to find the largest and smallest function of the continuous function on the parentheses.
𝑓 ′ (𝑥) = 0 √𝑥 √𝑥 - 3 = √11 - 𝑥, hence 𝑥 = 7 𝐷 𝐷 (𝑓) 𝐸 (𝑓) = [√8, 4].
Answer: [√8, 4].
5) Graphically determine the values ​​of those functions
the domain whose graphs are conveniently constructed on the basis of the properties of the shift function.
Example 4 (graphic method).
 Find 𝑓 (𝑥) = 𝑥 | 𝑥 - 4 |: The range of values ​​of the function [1].
𝑓 (𝑥) = 𝑥2 - 4𝑥 = (𝑥 - 2) 2 - 4 or {
Answer: (−∞, ∞) 6) Using known inequalities, we determine the value ranges of the functions in which it is possible to obtain the largest or smallest values ​​by using known inequalities.
  Largest և smallest example of a function Example 10.
  Find 𝑦 =:
jacks, where 𝑎, 𝑏> 0 [4].
Note that When x <0, then f (x) <0 When x> 0, then f (x)> 0 When x = 0, then f (x) = 0 It follows that the function f (x) assumes its greatest value (0; + ∞) in the range, and the smallest value in the range (-∞; 0).
The first method.
  How do we know for numbers 𝑎𝑥2 և ≥ | 𝑥 |: ∙ √𝑎𝑏, where the equation occurs when 𝑎𝑥2 = b.
When x> 0 ,, it follows that the largest value of the function f (x) is equal to, which ընդուն = √ ընդուն
 at the point.
 Since the function f (x) is odd, its smallest value is equal to -
  which the function f (x) accepts 𝑥 = 𝑏 𝑏
 at the point.
The second method.
  The function f (x) in the range (0; + ∞) coincides with 𝑔 (𝑥) =
    to the function where 𝑎, 𝑏> 0.
  This function will take its greatest value when h (x) = 𝑎𝑥 +
    The function accepts the smallest value.
Because 𝑎𝑥 ∙
= 𝑎𝑏 is constant, then 𝑎𝑥 +
   The sum accepts the smallest value when 𝑎𝑥 =
, that is, when 𝑥 = √𝑏
 .
Thus, we find that the function f (x) assumes the largest value in the range (0; + ∞) 𝑥 = √𝑏
  at the point և it is equal to the smallest value of the function f (x) we find in the first method.
Example 11.
 Find the greatest value of the product xyz if it is known that x, y, z> 0 և 2x + √3y + 𝜋z = 1 [4].
From the condition 2x + √3y + 𝜋z = 1, we get 𝑥 =
, where the equation will occur when using 2𝑥 = √3𝑦 = 𝜋z։.
