Preface.
  The complete system of professional orientation is perceived as a combination of interconnected, interdependent, complementary components, the cooperation of which is aimed at solving the problem of professional orientation of a person.
This approach allows professional orientation to be viewed as an ongoing system of interaction between the individual and society, aimed at meeting both the professional self-determination needs of the individual and the provision of an effective socio-professional infrastructure of society.
The role of family upbringing and socialization in the primary environment in which they grow up plays a great role in the formation of children's professional interests, professional choice, orientations, initial work skills.
Employers are also involved in the organization and implementation of vocational guidance activities in high school.
Main content.
 The problems of the child's professional orientation and work upbringing in the family have always been in the center of pedagogical science interests.
 A number of pedagogues have dealt with this issue.
 AS Makarenko mentions in his article "Education at Work". "Parents must first of all remember that their child will be a member of the working society, so its importance in that society will depend on how much he is able to participate in public work, how much he is ready for it.
 But the welfare, the material level of life will depend on it ”[2, pp. 57-58].
  In the family, of course, it is not possible to give a child a job that we normally qualify for.
  However, the parents think that family upbringing does not affect the child's professional qualifications.
 On the contrary, it is the family upbringing that is primary, for a person's post-professional choice, also for qualification.
  A. Makarenkongre. "The child who has received the right work upbringing in the family, he will continue his professional training in the future" [2, p. 54].
An active means of professional orientation and interest of children is the active cooperation between the school, the family and the child's parents.
 Practice shows that parents are usually actively involved in the development of their children's life ագիտական ​​professional programs.
 At the same time, the problems of choosing a profession and education are quite difficult for both learners and their parents.
 The advice of the latter often does not correspond to the real requirements in different spheres of the economy, in the labor market.
  In many cases, parents do not know չեն do not objectively assess the real potential, abilities, interests and abilities of their children.
  Parents' wishes ների Schoolchildren's inclinations and opportunities often do not match.
  Very often the motivation of parents to choose a profession for their children becomes the rating of the profession in the given society.
  The family must be able to prevent the child from choosing a profession by chance, և the parents must be able to manage the process.
  The participation of the family as an institution of socialization emphasizes the dual nature of professional orientation as a social-pedagogical issue.
  "Pedagogical experience և scientific research proves that only a systematic approach to issues related to schoolchildren's work self-determination will lead to the effectiveness of professional orientation activities" [3, pp. 3-4].
  Consider the peculiarities of the work done with parents in the direction of students' professional orientation.
  During the learning period, the child acts as an "object" of the educational process, an active, creative subject, who not only passively submits to the influence of the family, the school-pedagogical staff, but also actively influences the content of the content of the educational process.
  The unity of the family's school's influence on the child's personality, its general logic, is possible in order to form a socially acceptable position in the child towards the same phenomenon, which does not contradict the norms of morality.
  The provision of the mentioned principle is possible as a result of active school cooperation with parents, directing mutual influences, joining efforts and applying pedagogical methods and means in resolving the existing obstacles and contradictions.
The process of raising children is carried out as a result of the joint activities of teachers, parents, constructive and purposeful contacts.
  "One of the most important aspects of the joint activity of the family and the school is the joint approach to the realization of the goal-oriented positions, the increase of the content of the educational work with the students" [4, p. 268].
  In the system of professional orientation work, it is customary to consider the family from two sides: as a factor aimed at setting the preconditions for students' professional orientation (element of the system of influence on the child's personality), as an object of pedagogical influence of specialists (subject teachers, psychologists, social educators and employees).
 According to the modular system of professional orientation, the pedagogical education and work of parents is one of the primary methods of professional orientation of children և is carried out during the whole period of the child's education in the secondary school.
 The data of the studies on the motivations of choosing the profession of high school students in different regions of the country show that their parents and the relations established in the family have the greatest decisive influence on the issues of students' professional orientation and pursuit of professional interests.
 "Practice shows that the most developed students are those whose parents are able to provide a favorable psychological atmosphere in the family, serve as an example of diligence, kindness and social activism for their children" [4, p. 269].
 In the activities aimed at the professional orientation of the students, the parents solve the following problems: , Organize professional orientation group work with parents ինչպես Individual work both within the framework of inter-school և classroom activities and at the classroom level with individual families and groups.
Work with parents at the level of inter-school activities is carried out in the following main directions: 1. Provision of information on professional orientation activities, transfer of psychological and pedagogical knowledge, development of skills for applying the methods of professional orientation work with students.
2. Involvement of parents in the educational and professional orientation work of students at school.
3. Presentation and dissemination of successful examples, best traditions of solving family upbringing problems.
  The following activities are carried out with the parents in the direction of the professional orientation of the students at the inter-school level.1. Lectures for parents, which are aimed at professional development of students with school parents, are mainly psycho-pedagogical.
2. Organizing scientific-practical conferences and meetings for parents.
  Scientific-practical conferences contribute to the knowledge of parents' psychology, pedagogical knowledge, increase their awareness.
 Here, active, proactive participation by the parents is assumed.
3. An effective way to work with parents is to hold inter-school parent meetings throughout the school year.
  It is more effective to implement this egg of cooperation for the parents of elementary, basic and high school students separately, conditioned by the purpose, content, requirements of each age, methods and means of their implementation at each level of education.
4. "Open Doors Days" in educational institutions.
 Students' visits to various educational institutions, organizations, enterprises, as well as their mutual visits to school are effective for the purpose of professional orientation.
5. The work of the teacher with the parents, which starts from the first day of attending school և continues throughout the children's schooling in the secondary school.
  The teacher carries out his work both in groups and individually.
 The choice of work is conditioned by the individual psychological characteristics of the children, the nature of the relationships formed in the families, the level of knowledge of the parents, the experience in raising the children, professional interests, the degree of employment, the value system.
   Today, employers are also involved in the fields of general education, vocational education, and educational programs.
 In particular, activities implemented jointly with employers are an integral part of the vocational guidance system in high schools.
 This capability is conditioned by the participation of the representatives of the business environment in the system of vocational training in the high school, in the system of professional education, in accordance with the peculiarities of the existing requirements of the market relations, future requirements.
 In the field of education in general, in particular, the involvement of employers in high school presupposes their direct participation in planning and development programs, as well as their direct implementation in practice.
  Employers can be involved in the board of coordinators of professional orientation work in high school, in the school governing body, participate in the development of curricula, support the implementation of the educational process, establish partnerships.
  Employers work closely with vocational education institutions, mainly in the following ways:  are involved in the implementation of the curriculum, which includes assessment and quality control of education, համատեղ conduct training with teachers,  provide student work experience,  invite correspondents by profession , Են create job opportunities for graduates,  support with the necessary resources, դեպքում, if necessary, carry out "Skills ող Missing Skills" analyzes to identify the job market profile [1, p. 31].
 We are convinced that the involvement of employers in the process of professional orientation ensures mutual benefit, contributes to meeting the needs of partner parties.
  Thus, we come to the following conclusion that: 1. The family is the social institution that has a significant impact on the professional orientation of the learner, that parents first assess their child's abilities and capabilities.
  Therefore, their cooperation with the school in this matter will contribute to the correct choice of the student's profession.
2. In the case of professional orientation and professional selection of students in high school, the work, visits and collaborations carried out by employers in different directions are used.
3. Our research shows that family-school-employer cooperation should be intensified as an effective way of professional orientation work.
