Corporate legitimacy և Corporate legitimacy are valuable resources, the achievement of which is one of the necessary conditions for the operation of the organization.
  However, there are some difficulties in defining the definitions of "corporate legitimacy" and "corporate authority" in the scientific literature.
  In addition, theoretical materials are limited to clarifying the nature of the existing social connection between these two phenomena, as well as the peculiarities of corporate authority management.
First of all, let us refer to legitimacy, which has long been recognized as the starting point of political and governmental regimes, regarding the public acceptance of regimes and institutions and their recognition of the effectiveness of the exercise of power.
 The notion that the complete scientific conceptualization of the concept of "legitimacy" was first implemented by M. Weber was strengthened in the sociological literature.
 According to Weber, the notion of "legitimacy" is enshrined as the existence of notions of the "power" of the social order, it is manifested in the voluntary agreement of the subjects to recognize power and obey its orders.
  Such an order is more than the regularity of actions և backwardness [2, p. 21].
Here it is appropriate to mention the views of sociologist P. Bourdieu.
According to him, the legitimate "is the power to which the subject gives to the implementer, so to speak, a credit (credit), by which one gives to the other, fides, auctoritas, which one gives to the other, investing trust in it.
 It is a power that exists only because the one who is adopted believes that it exists ”[1, p. 209].
the consent of certain stakeholders.
The notion of "legitimate organization" has emerged as a result of the academic focus on legitimacy.
Attention to the legitimacy of the organization is accidental.
  Legitimate organizations և their leaders are perceived as "more valuable, more powerful, more predictable" more reliable "than illegitimate organizations and their leaders [8, p. 575].
 In addition, legitimate organizations are likely to receive support from voters և resources [7, p. 391] are no less active.
Consider two of the various definitions available in the scientific literature on the concepts of "corporate authority" and "corporate legitimacy".
It turns out that in order to gain legitimacy it is necessary. As for corporate authority, then it is a structure. ].
Reputation is a collection of knowledge ների feelings, which the interested parties have about the firm և its actions [9, p. 418].
It is already clear from the above-mentioned definitions that organizations, in the process of building prestige, following the public expectations and satisfying those expectations with their steps, become reliable and legitimate over time.
  In short, the organization, gaining a positive reputation, at the same time gains a valuable resource called legitimacy.
  The opposite statement is true.
 However, it should be noted here that such assertions operate in the context of a democratic regime, one of the advantages of which is the adoption of universal values.
Moreover, in a democratic regime there are competitive social relations, within the framework of which organizations develop and improve.
  Whereas in a non-democratic society it is possible to speak not about gaining legitimacy, but about attribution.
  Such legitimacy is "quasi-legitimacy" because organizations often deviate from the voiced or unvoiced rules in the performance of their functions, but at the same time enjoy the tolerant attitude of the initial stakeholders.
  The reasons for the admission of these organizations are hidden in the shortcomings of macro systems, which ultimately find their expression in the submissive behavior of an ordinary citizen.
 It should be noted that along with "quasi-legitimacy", the organization can actually have a negative reputation.
  A positive reputation option is also not excluded if the organization uses emancipatory communication, such as voiced negative sanctions.
In the further wording of the article, corporate authority և legitimacy will be seen in the context of a democratic society.
And so, the organization, maintaining a stable line of behavior, principles, norms acceptable in the dominant cultural circles, acquires a positive reputation over time.
  In other words, in the case of a positive reputation, one can talk about the expected behavior of the organization.
It should also be noted that the behavior of the organization may largely comply with the rules of society, but sometimes may deviate from them.
  One can assume that the organization, by deviating from the rules, can maintain or even increase its corporate reputation, if its social organizational behavior corresponds to the fundamental values ​​of the majority of society.
 In particular, reputable organizations are able to deviate from standard practices and continue to support their high status, legitimacy, as authority expands the scope of strategic management.
 In this case, we can talk not about the next, but about innovative organizations.
As for the differences between legitimacy and "authority", let us mention at least one. While legitimacy is a social perception that is the result of regulatory, normative, or cognitive norms and expectations, authority is a comparison between organizations based on a number of attributes that may include these same regulatory, normative, or cognitive dimensions [4, p. 332].
It turns out that the scope of corporate authority management, respectively corporate authority management, is wider than corporate legitimacy and its management.
As for corporate governance, the disregard for the new domain itself can have irreversible consequences for the disorganization, as in the information society, in a short period of time, different social perceptions about any organization can be formed, which will determine the further development of the object.
  Accordingly, the management of the organization's reputation should be viewed as a matter of strategic importance for the organization and an action plan for the construction of the latter should be developed in advance, the implementation of which will allow bringing the current state of the organization's reputation closer to the desired.
    Here it is appropriate to quote Driscoll and Cromby's view that no organization can be respected and loved by all audiences, so organizations choose and respond to the problems of the most influential stakeholders [5, p. 445].
Kim Harrison, a well-known public relations expert, singled out the following six steps aimed at improving corporate reputation among stakeholders.
1. Conduct research aimed at better identifying baseline stakeholders.
2. Assess the strengths and weaknesses of the stakeholders, as well as focus on the discrepancies between the internal nature and the perceptions of the stakeholders.
3. Examine the key factors that make up your organization and align them with the policies, systems, and programs that address the overall performance.
4. Develop plans to exceed stakeholder expectations.
5. Involve the CEO as a reputation program champion.
6. Regularly measure barriers to achieving goals and improving performance. [6]
When building a corporate reputation, the entity responsible for managing corporate reputation should also be well aware of the above five principles of corporate reputation management, which are: 1. different strength. Firms occupy a different, special space in the views of stakeholders. focus. Firms emphasize the starting point, 3. Consistency. Firms are consistent in communicating with all stakeholders, 4. Identity. Firms are considered real by stakeholders, 5. transparency. Firms are seen as open and honest when it comes to running their business [3, p. 8].
Adherence to the principles of core business building principles already considered in the article will enable the organization to improve its reputation among key influential stakeholders.
