The pastures of the alpine-subalpine zone are of special importance for the agriculture of the Republic of Armenia.
 Current climate change phenomena should be taken into account when discussing the rational use of pasture conservation.
  The widespread occurrence of pasture privatization and leasing, irregular, uncontrolled exploitation contribute to their rapid degradation.
 This phenomenon is particularly catastrophic for low-income communities, particularly in their vicinity.
For this reason, we preferred for our study the area of ​​Pemzashen, located on the northwestern slope of Mount Aragats, directly adjacent to the Pemzashen community, with a slope of 20-350 near the alpine zone, with an area of ​​about 2.5 hectares, which in early spring area.
Pemzashen community is considered to be one of the poorest communities in Armenia, it has only 400 hectares of arable land, 1200 hectares of pastures, about 100 square meters of agricultural land per capita.
There are about 350 hectares of abandoned quarries in the community.
 Raise the poverty rate in the community.
The pasture areas directly adjacent to the village are above the slope of Aragats, have different slope positions and slopes.
 In this period there are many basic exposures of slopes.
 The mentioned area, which is the lower border of the Alpine zone, serves as a pasture.
The soil cover is mainly slippery, basically with clay cover, where the slip layer varies between 10-15 cm.
 The climate of the area is temperate continental, with a series of well-expressed seasons.
  Precipitation falls mainly in spring, April and mid-June.
 The summer is very dry, with occasional showers.
 The second precipitation regime intensifies in autumn, in October-November.
 Stable snow cover is established from November to early April.
  The area is dominated by herbaceous cereals, currently due to irregular overgrazing the share of useful plants has decreased.
 During the last five years, the monitoring of the mentioned area outlined not only the development of vegetation and slope erosion, but also the activation of the following conditions conducive to slip landslides: - violation of pasture regime in early spring, late autumn, especially for small cattle, active livestock in spring. Serving as a route for the constant movement of animals, road erosion has intensified in the area, turning into a furrow over time.
 At the bottom of the slopes it has already been extended to one meter deep gorges.
  Heavy rains and hail, which have activated mudslides, have contributed to the deepening of gorges and the post-glacial process.
The preliminary observation of the area was made on 30.06.2010. During the internship of the ASPU Department of Geography, with the direct participation of students.
 Further study was carried out by means of periodic observations և calculations.
    Research methodology.
 The selected area, about 2.5 hectares, is divided into conventional equal squares with an area of ​​100x100 m.
 With the help of GPS Etexs 20 device, the existing ակա missing կի areas of the vegetation were measured in each square of the area and calculated as a percentage.
  The geographical coordinates of the area are given by WGS 84 UTM zone 38 system (Table 1).

The maximum result of the available և absent areas of vegetation in the separated squares of the area was 78.4% (5 squares) and the minimum was 22.5% (10 squares), the total average value of the vegetation of the study area is 68.2%.
The results of the following observations are presented accordingly.
* The second observation was made on August 14, 2010. The maximum result was 61% (2 squares), and the minimum was 12.5% ​​(8 squares), according to the preliminary calculation, the total average value is 48.8%.
* Third observation: September 12, 2010 The maximum result was 52% (2 squares) and the minimum was 2.5% (10 squares), the total average value is 32.2%.
* Fourth observation: November 21, 2010 In order to make the spring observations more substantial, in order to increase the accuracy of the assessment, 10 additional points were selected, which were marked with wooden numbered poles, and their coordinates were recorded (Table 2).
* Fifth observation on 29.05.2011.
Some of the indicators attached to the observations - 5 indicators with flooding of the ground և landslides - were not found on the day of the observation.
 The other 5 were preserved, և according to the comparison of GPS indications, a movement was registered: 3 poles (number 1,5,6) up to 1 m, and 2 (number 3,10) more than 1 m.
  The results of the fifth observation are presented in brackets in the table.

 All measurements were made with the help of GARMIN Etrex 20, GPS + GLONASS receiver, and the observation days and hours were selected in the conditions of the best resistance of the satellite stations.
In this respect, the accuracy of the measurements is sufficient for the results of the research.
The average portion of the area without vegetation in 2011 made 60-75% of the previous 2010 Instead of 50-55%, moreover, there are completely deprived plants.
As a result of the first և fifth observations, the erosion ditches and gorges formed during a year have deepened by an average of 15-20%.
Monitoring field data were processed and mapped.
As a result of the monitoring, a violation of a new soil layer extended by 20-50 cm above the slope with a width of 52 m was registered /29.05.2011/.
 This circumstance contributes to the activation of upward slope erosion for a year.
In the region, in the republic, all this started in parallel with the privatization process, or more precisely, with the weakening of state control.
 With the combined influence of natural and man-made signals, natural landscapes become more vulnerable year by year, a typical example being the observed area.
The field of landscaping of the republic is gradually expanding, the nature and degree of their vulnerability are getting stronger.
  At the same time, new mudslides appear and the old ones expand.
Conclusion • The main reason for the rapid vegetation of the studied area is the unregulated grazing regime.
 The average intensity of deforestation during one grazing season was 20-25%.
• The erosion activity of the slope is conditioned by the lack of vegetation, which is facilitated by the movement of the animals to the pasture, the intensive spring-autumn precipitation.
• At present, the area described above is a completely degraded, eroded area with almost no vegetation on the slope, with more extensive ravines compared to previous years.
One of the best ways to reduce the risk of such natural disasters is to keep the public informed about the situation.
 The process of raising awareness of the phenomenon we are observing as a slow-moving natural disaster is effective through the following links.
First, informing the population of the community, involving the school.
  The next level of awareness is the local self-government bodies, as the event may receive more large-scale manifestations.
The study of these phenomena is currently included in the Global և Regional Climate Models և Climate Risks [1].
