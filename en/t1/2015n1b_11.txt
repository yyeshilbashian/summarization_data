The age of 6-7 is considered the best for the development of memory, attention և thinking processes, ավար the pedagogue has a unique opportunity to influence the development of all these processes with the help of chess [7].
Psychology is an integral part of chess.
  The strongest chess players in the world pay special attention to psychologyreadiness.
There are several reasons why chess became so popular among children.
  Its brightAn example is the event we witnessed in Gyumri schools.
Teachers of other subjects are zealouschess subject, proving that the latter's students are betterrather than their subjects.
  The game is fascinating.
  It:develops qualities in the child that are difficult to achieve withoutIn modern life, intelligence and analytical skills, will and attention, memory and non-standard thinking, striving for victory and healthy self-respect.
We conducted several psychological tests and questionnaires in Gyumri N7, 9 և 11 schools for 2nd, 3rd and 4th grades.with students.
  4th graders are not taught chess(control group).
 The selected methods are aimed at identifying childrenmental abilities, qualitative features of cognitive processes: efficiency of attention, volume of mechanical memory, observation.
 We used the methods of observation and interview.
 The methods used are Attention Effectiveness Tests, which are designed to pay attentionAssessment of stability, distribution և transferability, observation test, mechanical memory test, Raven color matrix test, which examines the structure of analysis թե synthesis processes, level of mental development in children of mental age (grades 1-4), assessment of school anxiety level with a questionnaire [8].
  The latter is weakallows to study the level of school-related anxiety andnature in primary։ middle school age.
The results of the research allow us to conclude that:Positive changes in the development of cognitive processes, such as attention and memory, are observed in children who play chess.
  Ibra!After all, they usually do well in school, they are sensible and persistent.
  They have high self-esteem, their level of anxiety is low, they do not lose themselves in the face of any difficulty, they canto find the optimal solution to the problem.
Not everyone knows about the interconnectedness of chess և information technology [10].
 Young players are usually greatthey become programmers.
  This proves that chess is universalhas a developmental effect on children's mental abilities [1].
 Whatever profession the child chooses, chess will leave a mark on the intelligence developed in his life.
 Using our Raven matrices, it was found that 3rd graders,For the second year in a row, they have been playing chess, showing high levels of mental processes compared to 4th grade students.
 18 students of III-b grade of school # 11 were examined 20 20 students of IV-a grade.
 The results of the study show:showed that despite the age difference, highly developed IQs (8-10 points) were found for the given age groupThere are 9 students from the 3rd grade and 7 students from the 4th grade.
The results are presented in the form of a table and a graph.
 The graph shows the test results in points on the horizontal axis,the number of students surveyed on the vertical axis.

According to some parents, it is too early to start playing chessfor.
  In this regard, we consider it necessary to state that one of the concepts of developmental psychology, sensitivity, refers to sensitivity to certain influences.
  For example, the greatest sensitivity to languages ​​is in children aged 2-3 yearsIt is close, 5 year olds learn to read easier and better than otherschildren of that age.
 Children absorb impressions and knowledge like a sponge, but do not always show the results immediately.
Therefore, the sensitive age to start playing chess is also chosen mentallyexceeding the corresponding capacity indicators [9].
However, not all children who are obsessed with chess are championsbecomes.
 That is why chess is possible for most peopleThe second reason for early acquaintance is to raise a versatile, harmoniously developed young person [2].
In summary, we can say that chess solves one at the same timehow many problems?• Cognitive: expands the child's horizons, teaches to think,remember, compare, generalize, predict one's own activitiesresults, orient on the plane, which, at least,is useful for natural sciences, develops ingenuityև logical thinking.
