The 20th century is considered by ecologists to be a period of "3 E's" - energy, economics - ecology [12], and the 21st century is already, due to them, the period of immediate solution of many ecological problems [11].
The growing interest in nature-society relations in connection with the need to address the complex problem of rational use of natural resources has posed a number of challenges.
  Science has an urgent task to find ways out of environmental tensions.
 "Earth protection" is a cross-cutting course in geography and ecology, which studies the ecosphere as an interconnected system in the processes of social interaction.
 In geology, man is viewed in a social, cultural, economic and man-made environment, due to which the term ecosystem system is more applicable.
  The results of the study of this system are needed first and foremost by the management bodies of nature use [15].
Mankind has become such a powerful, natural, world power, which by its activities constantly transforms the planet Earth, leading to the destruction of its individual components.
  The anthropogenic impact is largely irreversible, often catastrophic.
Modern society is characterized as a consumer society (consumerism).
  Guided by economic growth indicators, it reproduces a generation with growing needs, which needs more and more resources every year to meet its needs.
Using the non-renewable resources of the environment, man returns to nature increasing volumes of waste.
  Moving on to the organization of sustainable development of ecologically clean, low-waste economy, let us not forget that any technology with the "presumption of guilt" is a hindering factor for all living organisms.
 Humans are always striving to develop և use technologies and materials that will do the least harm to the environment.
In order to develop the above-mentioned problems and challenges, as well as to develop more optimal strategies, in addition to the theoretical material of the training process of the Geology course, the relevant practical work has become more important. Assessing the feasibility of rational use of nature management [19].
When selecting practical works for individual sections, the possibility of their implementation was taken into account, from didactic materials, methods to the existence of a scientifically reliable database on the observed material, their statistical analysis.
Below are practical assignments for individual topics.
Geological Concepts, Laws, Provisions, Principles The terms and concepts used in the geology course are diverse, as they include the principles of և´ geography, հիմնական basic concepts, laws used in ecology։.
• Create a glossary.
 Give basic terms
explanation [17],
• Localization of the 4 laws of the Commons.
 In order to get an idea of ​​the environment, it is necessary to understand the separate laws, from which derive the many laws, provisions և principles applied in ecology, in particular in geology.
 In order to understand these laws, it is necessary to give practical examples of them, to localize [Agh. 1], [6].
Table 1. Analysis of Common Laws ացումը LocalizationLegisementsPracticeLaw DescriptionEverything is interconnected.
Everything has to "go" somewhere.
The components of nature are in complex interaction, there is no concept of "standard".
 Its stability is dynamic.
  The connection of the components of the system is sometimes direct և obvious, and sometimes complex and indirect.
Nothing in nature just disappears, disappears, but everything is in a stable cycle, constantly recovering.
Nothing is given just like that.
In order to achieve any result, you need to change something - ecological boomerang.
Nature knows better.
If something does not exist in nature, then its absence is necessary for the existence of life.
 The introduction of a new substance or process of nature harms life.
When completing the table, you should be guided by the relevant material of the NDP.
  It is necessary to localize the RA և Shirak region.
• In order to be informed about the modern challenges, it is necessary to select the 10 most urgent issues, to give the goal, to compile a questionnaire և to conduct social surveys [Salt. 2].
Table 2. Sample of the questionnaire [1] Question №QuestionYesNoDo not knowNot alwaysWe evaluate the answer "yes" to each question to 2 points, "no" to 0 points, "I do not know" և "not always" to 1 point.
The question can be in the form of a test, 4 questions and answers [Salt. 3].
For the implementation of this type of work it is necessary: ​​a) compilation of the questionnaire, b) results of the survey, c) interpretation of the results of the survey.
Amount of points Commentary Table 3. Evaluation scale When performing the commentary, consider in detail the possible sum options of the points երի make appropriate analyzes.
  As a result of the analysis of the survey data, it is necessary to provide solutions և to evaluate the effectiveness of their implementation.
1. Evaluate the human-nature relationship by measuring the "Ecological footprint".
 With a detailed questionnaire compiled by experts, each student calculates his share of influence on the planet Earth.
 The questionnaire covers all areas of human activity.
2. Landscape differentiation and classifications are necessary for accurate analysis.
 Different systems are distinguished in the environment, which are interconnected and interactive.
They are open systems with the exchange of matter և energy with the environment [1].
• As a first step it is necessary to create a terminological dictionary.
• As a practical task should be given in a separate environment
Schematic diagrams of the rotation of elements: water, carbon dioxide,
cycles of oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur և other elements and components [1, 2].
• Give schemes of anthropogenic systems of ecosystems by schematic mapping.
 Anthropogenic systems are man-made and created, which, unlike natural, are not self-regulating, self-renewing, or both are environmental
They exist through the exchange of material, energy and information.
3 ․ Is the population from a geological point of view? Is humanity threatened by the biosphere, the planet Earth by its number, the growing growth of nature, the lack of fresh water?
• Creation of a terminological dictionary [3].
• Calculate the share of energy in food by the next 10% law
in the 3rd level of the chain, if in the first level it is 1000
conditional unit [4].
• Using the TSC tables և Armecommonitoring Center
From the results of the observations, evaluate և analyze the surface of the RA
Ecological condition of water և basin of separate objects
for example (one student for each river և city).
• Compile the map of the ecological situation of the Republic of Armenia [4].
To make these works more complete
The group method is applicable.
  On the outline map of the Republic of Armenia, each group places the necessary indicators of the city or river allocated to it, performing background coloring, using common conditional signs.
• The real feature of the modern demographic situation
Clearly cover the latest statistics, according to which the population of the Earth in 2011. exceeded 7 billion, birth rate - about 25 ‰, mortality - 10 ‰, natural increase - 15 ‰.
 Every minute
270 children were born, 110 people died.
 The population of the Earth in one day
increases by 230,000.
 55% of the population lives at 200 m altitude, 24% at 200-500 m, 12% at 500-1000 m, 8% at 1000-2000 m, from 2000 m
high - 1%.
  75% of the population lives on 8% of the country.
 It:
causes "population pressure" on the environment, regardless of economic development or technical armament [1, 5].
• There are many models of civilization development,
in which an attempt is made to determine the optimal number of the given population
for the area, that is, “the capacity of the environment.
As in all the above cases, the initial step should be the terminological dictionary of the topic.
Table 4. Implementation of demographic policy in different countries [5, 7].
I. Countries that need to implement population reduction strategies.
II. Countries that must be preserved
population indicators.
 The list of countries can be left to the students' choice or a separate list.
Explain why the demographic revolution did not stabilize the population (demographic explosion, average population biological resistance, annual growth, potential) [4, 5].
• Using population change data in different years, make a graph և perform analysis using the comparative statistical method.
For the other topics of the course, practical tasks are provided, which are not included in the article only for technical reasons.
  Mathematical, statistical, analytical, comparative and other methods were used for their implementation.
Practical work ությունը analysis of the data obtained as a result of it will allow for a simpler և pictorial understanding of the processes։ to promote the growth of professional knowledge and skills.
every theme, diverse methods for creation of respective practical work were applied.
