Information technologies data collection, processing ևis a complete process of transfer methods and means, which:provided from the initial information of the object, process orto get new quality information about the state of the event.
The purpose of information technology is to produce information for human analysis, to take action and to make decisions based on it.
The learning process requires a variety of technologies.
  It belongs to the number of such technologiesinteractive technology, where the teacher and the student are the subjects of the learning process.
 Interactive learning is a special way of organizingin which it is excluded that the student does not participate in the collective, complementary,to the knowledge of all the participants of the educational process.
  The main purpose of interactive learning is to organize the educational processso that all learners become involved in the process experimentally.
The educational process must be carried out in a coordinated mannertogether.
  To organize interactive learning more effectivelyIt is necessary to use the following technologies:1. Work in pairs. The teacher should develop new methods for organizing work in pairs, where students should learn
Ask each other questions independently և Answer the "opponent"'s questions.
2. Carousel. Learners love this interactive technology
the type when two are formed in the classroom: internal and externalrings.
 With that, they manage to talk in a matter of minuteson several topics, trying to prove the answer to the interlocutorthe right version.
3. In the aquarium. The meaning of this technology is that several students
They play the situation in a circle, and the others, following the situation, analyze the results.
4. Task tree. The essence of this technology is the following. grade:
It is divided into three or four groups.
 Groups have equal numbersstudents.
  Each group discusses the issue և notesperforms "on his tree", then the groups, moving to the "neighbor tree",present their opinions.
The use of interactive learning technologies in the educational process is conditioned by the following stages:1. Orientation. Training of game specialists and experts.
The teacher introduces the work procedure to the schoolchildrendiscusses the main goals and tasks of the exercises, giving the characteristics of the rules of the game.
2. Readiness check. the teacher suggests the nature of the game,
Refers to the tasks, rules, roles of the game, the course of the game, the rules of counting points (about the game is madetable).
  Students gather additional information, consult with the teacher, discuss the content of the game andprocess.
3. Holding a game. պահ No one has the right to interfere from the start of the game և
steps to change.
 Only the moderator of the game can adjust the actions of the participants if they deviate from the main goal of the game.
The teacher cannot participate during the game.
  The task is such that he has to go back to the calculation of the game actions, results, points, clarify the inaccuracies ևhelp them at the request of the participants.
4. Game discussion. Game analysis, discussion և ratings
results stage.
  Teacher ները participants in discussionswith experts, exchange opinions, defend themselvespositions և solutions, express impressions և draw conclusions.
 At this stage, two models are implemented. 1. Passive: the student acts as an "object" of learning (listening only)sees,)2. Active: the student becomes a "subject" of learning (independent work, creative tasks).
So the process of interactive learning goes on and onIn the conditions of constant mutual activity of students, due to which the efficiency of all types of teaching processes increases և the quality of the trained staff.
