Teaching English oral communication is a complex system that involves a number of mental processes: perceiving, remembering, recognizing new information, as well as developing and transmitting it.
 Each of them, in turn, represents a combination of physical և mental և և activities, conditioned by a number of characteristics: learner age, mental potential, worldview, general knowledge, language thinking, language perception, etc.
In order to ensure the effectiveness of the process of teaching English orally, it is very important to single out the components of language competence that are delimited in the spoken-written English language.
  These are: vocabulary, grammar, phonology.
Grammar.
 Oral speech is often short conversations, dialogues, in which each thought can be expressed in more than one word or in a short connection, for example. Such conversations are possible, but they are short, it is practically impossible to continue long on different topics.
  Therefore, in order to have a more meaningful conversation, it is necessary to take into account և to collect the grammatical "resources" of the language as well.
It should be noted that English has some peculiarities, which are delimited in written-oral speech.
 Thus. If in written speech the subject + verb + verb + object (object) structure prevails, then in oral speech the stretched, alternative structures are more practical.
In written speech, preference is given to indirect speech, while in oral speech, direct speech prevails.
 In written speech, the simple word is preferable, and in oral speech, the indefinite, not simple word is applied.
 There are few pauses in written speech, while there are many pauses in speaking.
  Finally, it should be noted that there are no performance effects in the written word, but on the contrary, in the oral, they take their rightful place, including: o fluctuations, o repetitions, o wrong start, o incompleteness, o syntactical blends.
The peculiarities of written-oral speech are not limited to the above.
  There are other distinguishing features.
  For example, in speech, personal pronouns (I, you, my, our…) are used more often than in writing.
  In addition, there are peculiarities of the frequency of distribution of the sexes.
 Let us present them briefly.
 Thus, in oral speech. the present tense is twice as long as the past tense, o the present and past prepositional continuous forms are rare, o the conventional verbs make up only 2%, o the will, would would can modal verbs are very practical.
Grammar is one of the most important components of learning a foreign language.
 Due to the grammatical rules, words unite, form word combinations և sentences, as a result, the word has a meaningful nature.
  The term "grammar" has many meanings. o A system of rules and structures of a given language and a set of patterns of word change in sentences (normative grammar), o Knowledge of the rules, structures and patterns of a given language (theoretical grammar), o Aspect of speech activity, where grammar acts as a powerful means of serving speech activities system (functional grammar) [2].
One of the most important tasks for a foreign language learner is to know the grammar of that language in order to communicate, write, speak and read competently.
From this point of view, situational exercises are very effective in introducing learning processes, as learners perform them based on their life experience, facts of daily life, realities.
 In addition, situations can be created through various sources: pictures, movies, tables, realities, etc.
Next we offer the following situational processes aimed at mastering grammatical language material: Role play.

 Name, Situational exercises enable learners to develop the ability to use grammatical structure in verbal activities [4; page 5].
In modern methodology, situational approach is very effective because it is fascinating, և learners can simultaneously demonstrate their language communication skills, popular cultural experience.
 The teacher's task is to professionally prompt topics that contain appropriate language material, pushing learners to interact positively.
 In the presented situations, the teaching of grammar is carried out by a combination of interactions, including the corresponding language material.
 Learners are offered words, phrases, and vocabulary patterns that they must use in context, situations, or role-plays.
Thus, it becomes clear that the methods and approaches used in both vocabulary and grammar teaching are in fact aimed at developing learners' language and communication skills, whether they are perceptual or reproductive.
The teacher must know for what purpose this or that grammatical material is introduced to express thoughts (reproductive grammar) or to recognize or understand (perceptual grammar).
 The relationship between grammar and different types of verbal activities can be illustrated in the following diagram.

Written wordReadRegist Learners of reproductive grammar skills must acquire to understand the content of the text.
 Therefore, when developing or choosing grammar exercises, one should take into account the peculiarities of certain types of verbal activities, the complication of the content of the material և exercises, the use of the structure taught in context [5; page 69].
 First of all, the teaching of grammar is aimed at the formation / development of learners' grammatical competence, the activation of their intellectual activity.
  As stated in the basic document of modern European education, in the "Pan-European System of Language Awareness" vocabulary, grammatical knowledge and skills together with phonological skills form the language competence of learners, which is the core of their overall language communication skills [1; page 69].
Vocabulary.
 Before organizing vocabulary training, it is necessary to develop և clarify a strategy, which includes the following stages: - word presentation / explanation, - word memorization / reinforcement, - word usage in communication.
Strategies that develop vocabulary knowledge are constantly changing, supplemented by new exercises, as teaching methods, approaches, goals, and public order change over time.
 Vocabulary training is the core of language education, without which it is impossible to communicate in a given language.
 Communication is improved, first of all, by enriching the vocabulary with the correct use.
 Learners' grammatical and phonological knowledge, as well as their cultural, practical, verbal, compensatory abilities are possible.
Today, when the interests of the learners are diverse and varied, it is essential to organize the teaching of a foreign language as pleasant and interesting as possible.
  When introducing new words in this regard, we should not be satisfied with traditional teaching methods and means, but try to present as new and interesting solutions as possible, teaching the vocabulary in a communicative context, in an interactive environment.
 So, let's look at the "GUESS THE MEANING - Thoughts that help us live" exercise - "GUESS THE MEANING, Gaps and guessing.
  Thoughtsthat help us to live ”. Note that students usually enjoy doing this exercise, especially if the teacher introduces the topic of discussion in advance.
1. The set timer is ten minutes.
2. The process.
Stage 1. The teacher writes a saying on the board, in which some words are not mentioned, for example, "A room without ……… is like a body without soul." (Cicero).
 Their attention should be focused on the author of the speech.
The teacher mentions that if the author, for example, is Franklin, M. Twain, b. Show others, then the thoughts will be wise or humorous.
Stage 3. When the missing words are filled in (for example, "A room without books is like a body without soul." Each of them tries to express his opinion.
Thus, when choosing or importing a vocabulary, the topic of communication is essential, it must be authentic, interesting to the learners.
 It is very important for them to stimulate the inner need to learn, to develop active interaction.
 On the other hand, as a result of regular introduction of such exercises, students' perceptual, discursive, analytical-comparative verbal skills will develop.
Phonetics.
 Recognizing the importance of accent in the process of teaching oral speech.
  It serves to separate the flow, to emphasize the key meaning of the word.
Usually the accent of modern English is mastered through exercises and re-exercises.
 The whole meaning of a sentence or a word can be changed with an accent.
 Therefore, in addition to textbooks, it is very important for learners to listen to lives duplicate the language of speakers (livespeech).
 In this connection, it is appropriate to mention that in English, the one who speaks with accent distinguishes the parts of nouns, but the word.
Next we present words - nouns with their corresponding verbs.
 When the first syllable is stressed, the word is a noun, and when the last one is a verb.
Exception: There are some points that are similar to the above words, but they do not have a change of accent, for example. CONtact, DIScount, FInance, INterest; նաև conSENT, conTROL, disGUISE, diVORCE. However, every word has an accent.
  It should be noted that often the meaning of a sentence can be changed by changing the stress, for example, in the following sentence. A) The stress on the word "I". The meaning is that everyone likes to be late, the speaker does not.
b) The emphasis on the word "do not". Everyone thinks that the speaker likes to be late, but he does not like it.
c) The emphasis on the word "like". The speaker shows that he does not accept the delay or even hates it.
d) The emphasis on the word "late". The speaker shows that he hates being late the most.
It follows from the example that emphasizing different words changes the meaning of the sentence.
Many times learners do not communicate with English when communicating.
  As a consequence, their words do not sound nice, instead they seem boring and unattractive.
  Therefore, the teacher should give corrections to the students so that they not only speak competently, but also follow the correct pronunciation and melody.
There may be one feature that is specific to English spoken language.
 This refers to the connection of new information in high pitch.
  In oral speech, at the end of the tonal units, the high tone implies the continuation of the speech, and the low tone - the end.
 Therefore, this feature should be noticed in the learning process.
First of all, it would be right to combine phonetic-pronunciation works with teaching vocabulary and grammar.
  Learners should always be given the opportunity to refine their pronunciation, to encourage them to write the spelling of the word and the transliteration of sounds.
It is very important to take into account the factors of speech in order to ensure the effectiveness of the process of teaching English.
From this point of view, three important factors stand out, which contribute to the smoothness of speech during communication.
 They are: cognitive, sensory, performance.
Cognitive factors include: o Introduction to the material. The more familiar the material of the conversation, the more meaningful the conversation.
 Naturally, the teacher's task is to take into account the audience's opinion, preferences, age psychological factors when choosing topics.
o Introduction to the genre. Being familiar with the genre contributes to the easy comprehension of speech.
o Introduction to the interlocutor. The better you know your partner, the easier it is to talk to him.
 Therefore, the teacher must be able to carefully organize collaborations, group work, in which students communicate as actively as possible.
o Sensory factors. In general, the initial disposition towards the material of the conversation or towards the speaker or either fails the verbal interaction.
 Naturally, the teacher should stimulate the students' inner desire to form their own message, to convey it, as well as the ability of the communicator, to respect and tolerate his / her opinion, that is, in the educational environment as safe, easy and respectful as possible.
o Performance factors include: o Speech. Speaking face to face, sometimes using body language (gestures, eye contact, facial expressions, hand, foot movements) can provide more effective communication.
o Degree of cooperation. The more the students are united and cooperative, the more they will have to say, the richer the content presented by the material presented by them.
  On the other hand, they realize the importance of helping each other because they have equal responsibility for the work.
o Effective time planning. This is a very important factor, because only with proper and effective time planning can you prepare well for a conversation or presentation.
  The more time there is to prepare, the more accurate, infallible and literate the word will be.
o Environmental situations. They can be different, for example, speaking under loud music or in poor acoustic conditions, of course, not everyone is comfortable or easy (even in Armenian).
 From here, things get trickier, and this is where the true comfort of a classroom or a classroom comes in!
o Motivation to speak. At the heart of any foreign language teaching is the principle of creating situations that facilitate learners' communication.
  The learner must always have the motivation to speak, the motivation to speak.
  And the more convincing that motivation is, the more effective the communication will be [3; page 132].
Oral speech is one of the possible manifestations of human mental abilities.
 The development of oral speech takes place during a person's whole life, bearing the complete stamp of the general development of the society.
  Continuous processing of oral speech is a mandatory, continuous and post-coherent process.
 Its development is based exclusively on the real function of language.
Here is a summary of the factors that can be taken into account orally.
 However, it should be noted that they are not limited to predicting or guaranteeing the effectiveness of the conversation, as there are personal-psychological factors.
  Thus, haste can not always have a negative effect.
  Even some interlocutors are more fluent և in a systematic way, when they have a problem և to deliver time.
  In addition, physiological factors such as mood, fatigue, health, etc. may be present during oral speech.
Both linguistic and non-linguistic knowledge are used for the success of oral speech.
  In other words, in order to have an effective conversation, it is necessary to have basic knowledge on the topic of conversation, such as judgmental or discourse knowledge, knowledge of the speech process, and finally, grammatical, lexical, phonological knowledge.
Accounting for the above components is a prerequisite for developing learners' oral communication skills. It requires a systematic approach.
Therefore, it is necessary to periodically review and refine existing teaching methods, approaches and technologies, which, due to objective and subjective circumstances, may lose their effectiveness and relevance.
It is obvious that their correct choice and application in the conditions of the dominance of communication learning is aimed at increasing the efficiency of teaching / learning, the formation and development of students' language and communication competence.
