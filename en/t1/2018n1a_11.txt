Fuel resources in the territory of the Republic of Armeniain practice the absence of the country is constantly dependentputs imported resources whose price volatility in the marketlead to economic problems [1].
 Satisfy the internal demandThere is a growing number of small bodies of water being built on mountain riversPower Plants (HPPs) Based on RA Landscape ռ Water Resourcesfrom the opportunity provided.
Small hydropower plants have a number of advantages: small occupationsarea, no need for dam, general system load distribution, infrastructure maintenancelow value [2].
 A number of countries, such as China [3] [4], Nepal[5], India [6], Turkey [7], Latin America և CaribbeanThe countries [8] have chosen the development of small hydropower plants as their energy policy.
Mainly the technologies for the construction of this type of hydropower plantsThere are two. a) diversion, when part of the river flow is diverted through canalsև directed to generators, b) river flow: the system uses the natural flow of the river;without diverting the flow.
  Both of these technologies do not require the construction of large-scale dams.
Only subversive technology is used in small hydropower plants in Armenia.
In addition to the advantages of small hydropower plants, there are someproblems.
 At risk of negative impacts are agriculture, urban development, historical and cultural structures, waterThe ecology of the objects can lead to disturbance of the groundwater balance, with consequent complications.
The impact of small hydropower plants in the agricultural sector is greaton the qualitative-quantitative indicators of the lands.
Due to the activity of small hydropower plants, the water level changed as well as the concentration of dissolved substances directly affect the soils, reducing their yield, even that.lands can become unsuitable for agricultural activitiesfor [10].
Groundwater plays an important role in maintaining and restoring moisture balance.
  Small hydropower plants in some areasThey raise groundwater levels and in some places lead to depletion or drying out.
 Rising groundwater affects archaeological and historical monuments, damaging the still undiscovered archaeological sites that Armenia is rich in.
 Figure 1 shows the soaked Marmashen monasteryand salt walls, which is a consequence of rising groundwater.
Such a long-term effect can lead to serious damage to the monumentdamage.
The impact of small hydropower plants with the technology (diversion) used in Armenia is significant, hydrophysical, hydrochemical ի of the aquatic ecosystem.on hydrobiological indicators.
 Long-term study of the Hoz Seca River in Spain before the construction of a small hydroelectric power plantThen they showed that although the construction of a small hydroelectric power plant is by no meansreflect on the diversity and biomass of protozoa,This led to a 43% reduction in fish numbers.
 Besides that,The gas-water balance is disturbed during the operation of a small hydroelectric power plant(decreases the oxygen content), the temperature rises, it occursChemical contamination with creams used in JEC mechanismswith other oil products [15].

It should be noted that the risks associated with small hydropower plants are possibleHarmful effects are much less than in the case of medium to large hydropower plants.
The criteria for building a small hydroelectric power plant in Armenia are site engineeringexpediency և water flow rate.
  Although, how?It has already been mentioned that the maintenance of small HPP infrastructure is not requiredhigh costs, but its construction and technical equipment are largerequire investments [2].
  According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (www.irena.org) for the construction of a small hydropower plantA minimum of $ 1,300 / kW is required and $ 500 / kW for further upgrades.
 Table 1 shows the existing ones on the Akhuryan Riversmall hydroelectric power plants, judging by their power, it becomes clear that the word,It is really about big investments.

 Such damages may include compensation to the community or individual for damage to the landor maintenance costs of area structures.
 In addition, the damage done to nature must be compensated.
 As a consequence, it may turn out that a small hydropower plant, instead of generating revenue, causes damage; it is necessary to stop operation (such cases increase whenThe volume of water use in other sectors of the economy is increasing).
 To avoid such problems can be madeA small standard for a hydroelectric power plant to be pre-assessedcost-benefit ratio, calculate the required output capacity, the revenue of which will exceed the output և if the river potential can generate the required capacity in the given site, allowthe construction of the station.
 The passport must contain the following sections:1. Engineering norms: compliance of the structure և equipment according to:HHSN"Seismicconstruction. Design:
norms "SNIP 2.02.02-85 "Substrate of hydraulic structures",HHSHN IV-10.01.01-06 * "Subsoil of buildings and structures",SNIP 2.01.07-85 "Loads և Impacts"HHSN I-4.02-99 "Reconstruction, restoration-strengthening of buildings and structures. basic provisions. "
2. Economic significance of the community, region and republicThe degree of satisfaction of the energy demand of the nearby community, the need for surplus energy for the region and the republic.
3. Environmental norms: degree of change in river flow և water composition (physical, chemical և biological parameters of river watermonitoring և their comparison before the construction of the stationwith the relevant indicators).
In general, it should be noted that the development of small hydropower plants in Armeniais of strategic importance.
  They can meet domestic energy demand by gradually reducing dependencefrom imported resources.
  In a country with a small area like ArmeniaThe initiative should be comprehensively considered in order to increase efficiency and reduce environmental damage.
