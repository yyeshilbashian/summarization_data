The practically lack of fuel resources in the territory of the Republic of Armenia constantly makes the country dependent on imported resources, the price instability of which leads to economic problems in the market [1].
 In order to meet the domestic demand, the number of small hydropower plants (HPPs) being built on mountain rivers is increasing, based on the opportunity provided by the RA landscape և water resources.
Small hydropower plants have a number of advantages: small space occupied, no need for dams, overall system load distribution, low maintenance cost of infrastructure [2].
 A number of countries, such as China [3] [4], Nepal [5], India [6], Turkey [7], and the Latin American Caribbean [8], have chosen the development of small hydropower plants as their energy policy.
There are two main technologies for the construction of this type of hydropower plants. a) diversion - when part of the river flow is diverted through canals to the generators; b) river flow, the system uses the natural flow of the river without diverting the flow.
  Both of these technologies do not require the construction of large-scale dams.
Only subversive technology is used in small hydropower plants in Armenia.
Along with the advantages of small hydropower plants, there are also some problems.
 Agriculture, urban development, historical and cultural structures, ecology of water bodies are in the risk zone of negative impacts, they can lead to the disturbance of the groundwater balance, with subsequent complications.
The impact of small hydropower plants in the agricultural sector on the qualitative-quantitative indicators of large arable lands.
Due to the activity of small hydropower plants, the changed water level, as well as the concentration of dissolved substances, directly affect the soils, reducing their yield, and even make these lands unsuitable for agricultural activities.
Groundwater plays an important role in maintaining and restoring moisture balance.
  Small hydropower plants in some areas raise groundwater levels and in some places reduce or dry out.
 Rising groundwater affects archaeological and historical monuments, damaging the still undiscovered archaeological sites that Armenia is rich in.
 Figure 1 shows the wet salted walls of Marmashen Monastery, which is due to the rising groundwater.
Such a long-term effect can lead to serious damage to the monument.
The impact of small hydropower plants with the technology used in Armenia (diversion) is significant on the hydrophysical, hydrochemical and hydrobiological parameters of the aquatic ecosystem.
 Long-term studies of the Spanish Hoz Seca River before the construction of the small hydropower plant showed that although the construction of the small hydropower plant did not in any way affect the diversity and biomass of the protozoa, it reduced the number of fish by 43%.
 In addition, during the operation of a small hydropower plant, the water-gas balance is disturbed (oxygen content decreases), the temperature rises, and chemical contamination occurs with creams used in hydropower plants with other oil products [15].
Fig. 1 Impact of Groundwater on Marmashen Monastery [13] It should be noted that the risks associated with small hydropower plants և potentially harmful consequences are much less than in the case of medium և large hydropower plants.
The criteria for building a small hydroelectric power plant in the Republic of Armenia are the engineering expediency of the site արագ the speed of water flow.
  Although, as noted, the maintenance of small HPP infrastructure does not require large expenditures, its construction and technical equipment require large investments [2].
  According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (www.irena.org), the construction of a small hydropower plant requires a minimum of $ 1,300 / kW and $ 500 / kW for further upgrades.

 Such damages may include compensation to the community or individual for the cost of maintaining the structures in the area that did not cause damage to the land.
 In addition, the damage done to nature must be compensated.
 As a consequence, it may turn out that a small hydroelectric power plant, instead of generating revenue, causes losses և it is necessary to stop operation (such cases increase as water use in other sectors of the economy increases).
 In order to avoid such problems, it is possible to draw up a normative passport of the hydroelectric power plant, in order to evaluate the cost-benefit ratio in advance, to calculate the required output, the revenue of which will exceed the cost, if the river potential can generate the necessary capacity,
 The passport must contain the following sections.1. Engineering technical norms: compliance of the structure and equipment according to the Armenian Academy of Sciences "Seismic construction. Design norms ", SNIP 2.02.02-85" Substrate of hydraulic structures ", HHSN IV-10.01.01-06 *" Substrate of buildings and structures ", SNIP 2.01.07-85" Loads և impacts ", HSHN I-4.02-99 Reconstruction, restoration and strengthening of buildings և structures. basic provisions. "
2. Economic significance for the community, the region and the republic, the degree of satisfaction of the energy demand of the nearby community, the need for surplus energy for the region and the republic.
3. Environmental norms: the degree of change of river flow և water composition (monitoring of physical, chemical, biological parameters of river water և their comparison with the relevant indicators before the construction of the station).
In general, it should be noted that the development of small hydropower plants is of strategic importance to the Republic of Armenia.
  They can meet domestic energy demand by gradually reducing dependence on imported resources.
  In a country with such a small area as Armenia, such an initiative should be comprehensively considered to increase efficiency and reduce environmental damage.
