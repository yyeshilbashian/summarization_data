The subject of progression is studied in great depth in the school course of mathematics, in the framework of which the formulas for calculating the sums of the sums of successive members with the end of arithmetic-geometric progressions are discussed.
However, in the algebra school course, as in various curricula, such sums are discussed, the members of which are not successive members of arithmetic or geometric progressions.
1; 234; 5nnS211i In general, one of the well-known methods used in elementary mathematics to calculate sums is the so-called "difference" method, according to which: An attempt is made to find a function in which the representation takes place for each sum of money.
 If we manage to find such a function, we will get:
This work is dedicated to calculating all the sums whose members are multiples with real coefficients.
Below we will first formulate and prove some theorems, using the latter to propose new approaches to the calculation of all sums whose total terms are determined by polynomials with real coefficients depending on the order.
