In depth in school mathThe topic of progression is studied, in the framework of which the finite arithmetic and geometric progressions are discussed.Formulas for calculating the number of consecutive members.
But in the school of algebra, how different!in petitions are discussed as follows:finite sums whose members are not successive members of arithmetic or geometric progressions.
