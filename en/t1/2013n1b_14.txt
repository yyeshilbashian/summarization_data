The issue of scientific language, that is, the means of scientific expressionis a priority in the natural sciences, especially physicsplaying.
Based on the issues raised in the natural sciencesby nature, the question of linguistic rational expression arisescertain similarities in the diversity of natural phenomena andthe search for patterns, which can be accomplished only within a logical system with the help of mathematical abstractions.
  Such problems necessarily ariseare also in the teaching process where the ideas are taughtThe efficiency of delivery և assimilation is conditioned և is dictated by a reasonable choice of scientific language and means of expression.
  And in general the theory of various physical phenomenaThe fact of the generality of the description shows the application of mathematical abstractions and logical schemes in physics.Necessity և naturally reflects the unified and general nature of nature, the process of its knowledge.
  Such a generalOne of the most meaningful ideas is physical conditionthe idea.
 As we know, in classical physics the physical systemThe dynamic state is determined at each point in time if:The values ​​of the dynamic variables that characterize the system are known.
  In particular, to give the state of a mechanical system, it is sufficient to indicate at some point all its generalized coordinates and generalized velocities.
 And classical physics deals essentially only with the study of the change in the state of the system over time, and with the application of the idea of ​​the classical state.although methodological analysis is not usually performed.
  However, unlike classical physics, in quantum theoryDynamic state of the system և between dynamic variables ևCompliance does not have such a direct nature.
  Quantum stateThe idea is reminiscent of a vector in real spacethe concept of invariant, and its various representations are equivalentto a system of vector projections in a certain system of coordinates.
  And the idea of ​​a vector not only simplifies the calculationdifficulties, he և allows to openly take into account its invariant nature և independence from the choice of coordinate base.
The advantages of this mathematical algorithm for describing the situation make you think of developing the same system as possible.also in some classical conditions (particularly thermal, electric)optical) for presentation.
 Similar experiments for thermal and electrical states and corresponding simulations[1], [2], [3] have already been suggested by us.
  Condition modelingAll the examples discussed are closely related to another abstractionwith the resulting idea of ​​linearity.
  The wide application of mathematical abstractions based on the linearity of the course of events under certain conditions clearly provesThe essential role of this idea in the mathematicalization of scientific research, as well as in the introduction of appropriate algorithms in the teaching process.
  At the heart of quantum theoryThe linearity of the set Hilbert space is, for example, an opportunityallows to form from two arbitrary vectors of quantum statesNew state vectors with infinite set.
  That is, as the mainprinciple: the assertion that the dynamic state of a quantum system allows a linear superposition that is similar to an arbitrary vector in real space, non-orthogonalthe "rule of parallelism" of component analysis.
  Such an algorithmIt is also characteristic of our classical states (thermal, electric)for the above mentioned modeling systems.
Now, summarizing the general judgments made,Let us emphasize the following conclusions, which are considered key for the previous ([2], [3]) works. in the processes of teaching physics, which are largely in line with the development of physical science

introduction of provisions.
A common, more realistic perception of physical science among students about the reality around them, andIn order to form an opinion, in our opinion, it is desirable to carry out the processes related to the classical (non-quantum), a) stage of phenomena by introducing such a mathematical premise (mathematical modeling of the idea of ​​physical condition;state reversal (emphasis on the superposition function), whichis characteristic of quantum mechanical observations of the microcosmfor.
 The work presented below is dedicated to the optical statemathematical modeling of the idea.
  Recommended:The provisions emphasize the general nature and methodological advantages of the mathematical representation of classical states, althoughIn our opinion, they need further improvement and development.
As we know, in applied optics there are usually noharmonious, complex spectral light waves when floorThe dependence of the refractive index of the medium on the wavelength (dispersion) is taken into account, and the use of sufficiently large light fluxes forces not to be limited to only paraxial rays.application.
  From the point of view of geometric optics, such negative factors lead to various defects in the images formed by optical systems, which are thoroughly and comprehensivelyStudies have led to the extreme improvement of modern optical devices.
Along with the development of optical equipment, it has succeededsignificantly reduce mapping errors.
  Such achievements are realized mainly in multi-lens systemsusing.
  Most refractory systems used in practice contain at least two or more refractive surfaces.
That is why centralized complex optics are useddetailed monitoring of systems.
Developed a general theory of optical systemsGauss dates back to 1841, which was later developed by other scientistsin the works.
  Gaussian theory establishes correlationscomplex points in the spaces of objects and images,between lines and planes, having a purely geometric nature.
Let us now try to give another interpretation to this problem of theoretical-practical interest in the formation of a complex optical system from simple systems: physical (in this casein the context of a vector representation of optical states.
 Let us introduce the idea of ​​the physical state of the optical system with the idea of ​​evaluating the reflection of that state on the behavior of the rays passing through the system.
  As we know, six guideline planes of the optical system are enough for such a question (two focal points, two main points, two node points)are defined as focal և:and the positions depend on the curvature of the refractive surfaces of the systemfrom radii, distances from each other, refractive indices of media bounded by ff that surface.
  System:Such comprehensive information on physical characteristicsshould, in our opinion, summarize the very idea of ​​the optical state,to which this observation is devoted mathematically.
2. Consider the operation of simple optical systemsApproximately geometric optics.
  Such an approximation when:It is possible to get rid of the wave properties of light completely, it is in line with the corpuscular light photon interpretation, from which one canuse to introduce the idea of ​​optical state, ieAnalyze the operation of the optical system from a quantum mechanical point of view.
In particular, consider the breakthrough different (

 Now for geometric opticsLet's analyze the mentioned problem from the quantum mechanical point of view - lightobserving the rays as the simultaneous motion of photons21, nn1SPS1EF2S2S1S1SPS1PS1PS1EFMN2S1S2S1n2nPPP ways of modeling states.

  And like that?The probability estimate can be made according to [4], as follows:manner.

So-from the source point of photon delivery (

In other words, productive-vector defines a sphere ևOptical (focusing) activity of the surface.
Formatting an optical image of an object in the same optical system (aggregation of refracting surfaces)is carried out by photons delivered from the source through the whole systemas a result of the reversal of the states of simultaneous motion with respect to whichA similar chain of reasoning can be applied.
In general, we can say that any optical system Optical activity can be depicted (modeled) in a certain waywith a vector that is interpreted as a refracting optical systemstate vector.
 And the directional output vector of the system state can be represented by the analysis of the composite vectors, which:2S1S2S1S21PSS21SPS21SPS2S21PSS21SPS21SPS21PSS21SPS21SPSie1S2Sconstt ~ S1S2S2S1S2 ~ OWO components in optical condition of individual refractory elements of the systemare the vectors.
 It should be noted that the idea of ​​optical conditiononly imported in different states (different optics)systems (superposition) for the development of a mathematical algorithm, where a separateThe spatial factor of the mutual arrangement of systems (distances between systems of the main optical axisalong).
In particular, the optical state of the production system(the course of the rays passing through it) depends separatelyoptical states of subsystems, such as the latterfrom mutual arrangements.
  The possible applications of optical diagrams can be justified not only individuallyto simplify the computational difficulties of forming complex optical systems from subsystems, but to reverse the problem with a system with the required parameters (focal length)in terms of discussing the most possible formulation options.
