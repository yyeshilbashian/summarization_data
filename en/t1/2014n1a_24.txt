The problem of efficient use of land resources is inseparable from environmental and ecological problems.
 In Shirak regionLand conservation և There are a number of issues related to efficient land usedirections.
  The main causes of soil deterioration are soilErosion, stonyness, pollution, physical and geographical external factors.
 Their intensity in many cases dependsfrom human activity, which is expressed in land management ևin the development process [1].
 Our goal is to propose rational nature use և land conservation solutions, to make human economic activity unsuitable for agricultural usemeasures to restore the lands that have become.
Soil erosion is one of the most common and influential factors in its deterioration.
 Relative to the area in Shirak regionyouth, small incisions, low exposure of root rocks, low slopes, insufficient vegetationled to a weak expression of natural erosion.
  The exceptions are the slopes of the Shirak և Pambak mountain range, where the presence of floodplains creates favorable conditions.for spatial and linear erosion.
 But let's note that Ani, Artikան Irregular և Heavy land use in Akhuryan regionsUnder these conditions, the erosion phenomenon becomes more pronounced.
Irrigation erosion reaches a certain level in Shirak region ևcauses the impoverishment of the nutrient layer of the soil.
 Not moderate և noIn case of reasonable irrigation, along with irrigation erosion, the volume fractions increase in the mechanical composition of the soil, it deteriorates.water permeability, there is an increase in water-soluble salts ևAcceleration of downward placement in the soil absorption complexCalcium deficiency, suppression և cementation.
 All this leads to:Humus content reduction and fertility indicatorsdecline.
The most important thing to fight against irrigation erosion is to follow the agro-technical rules of plant cultivation.
  First of all, during irrigation, the given water costs should be maintained in accordance with the slope of the surface.
 On sloping slopes you need potatoes, sugarBeetroot հող perennial in soils under other broad cropsCreate buffer (neutral) erosion-safe layers with the help of herbs[6]
  It is especially advisable to separate them at the bottom of the slopein the marginal parts of the field.
 After sowing potatoes, it is necessary to make arable plow for wheat cultivation, so that the soil reachesstrengthen, but sowing grain in the ground for 5-6 years in a row candamage again, causing unwanted hardening.
  Soil hardeningis also a deteriorating factor that causes soildeterioration of agrophysical, hydrophysical properties, which are:Finally, their fertility rates are affected.
 Soil hardening is due to the fact that it is left under perennial crops for a long time during cultivation, often by livestock on the surface.with movements, use of equipment.
  In this case, the main means of struggle is the correct implementation of crop rotation, the selection of appropriate crops.
They are one of the reasons for the deterioration of lands in general. "Over-wetting and salinization of soils.
  There is such a problem in ShirakOn both sides of the Vardaghbyur-Ashotsk road of Ashotsk plateau.
South of the city of Gyumri, in the lands occupied by an area of ​​about 5000-6000 hectares, the groundwater level reaches a depth of 2 m.
 In terms of over-wetting and salinization, this depth is not dangerous in the climatic conditions of the Shirak plain.
  But here comes anotherproblem. The groundwater south of Gyumri is polluted by water flowing from the city
due to absorption [4], so their use as a source of soil moisture is not allowed.
 He has emerged in Shirak in recent years. "Another problem is observed in the areas of Arapi և Kate communitiesLand drying, which can lead to desertification.
In Shirak region, the issue of combating land pollution is urgent.
 Dangerous dust from garbage dumps in Gyumri, Artik, Maralik and other settlements is a source of pollution here.wastewater, polluted surface flows inside cities ևthe use of numerous quarries in the area.
As a result of post-earthquake reconstruction worksThe area of ​​Gyumri has been expanded by about 20 square kilometers, due to which the amount of various harmful substances washed from the city has increased.In addition, 16% of construction waste accumulation is still presenton the most favorable lands for economic development, as a result of which the area of ​​arable lands in 1987. decreased by 8% compared to
is [5].
 Studies show that pollution rates are rising, which is due to the city graduallydeteriorating sanitary condition.
 Anthropogenic pollution is high in the rivers of Gyumriget, Ghorghoba, Cherkezi gorge coming out of the city, especially in summer, when the water is fully used.for irrigation purposes, and the impact of irrigation water quality on soil pollution is immediate.
The problems of land protection and the environment in general around the city of Artik are closely related to the tuff industry.
  75% of the waste generated from the extracted rock massonly 30% has been recycled.
 15% of the remaining waste was dumped in Gomshadzor ևMoghrov valleys.
 Not just in these valleys, but all around the cityThe vegetation is very poor.
 Such surfaces have becomevulnerable to erosion processes.
Pemzashen is also the cause of soil and environmental pollution.The remaining quarries of Anipemza և region, which, being pollutedoutbreaks, which are simply abandoned after exploitation և remain unusable, contributing to the intensification of land degradation.
 Currently, 1512 hectares of land have been violated in Shirak region (according to the data of Shirak regional administration), which may become potentialcause of desertification.
  There are such lands in 40 communities of the region, which occupy a particularly large area of ​​Artik, Harich,Within the communities of Bagravan, Pemzashen և Tufashen.
  Environmental "The above-mentioned are of great environmental importance"Rehabilitation of lands abandoned for other man-made reasons to include recultivation in the field of agricultural productionevents [3].
Certain environmental-soil-environmental problems are also posed by external physical and geographical factors - landslides,Debris, rockslides, mudslides, ravines, and associated soil erosion.
 Although they are weak in Shirak, 0.1% of arable land, 0.2% of grasslands and 4.2% of other lands are affected by these factors.
 Explosions during quarry operation in the region, presence of dangerous precipitation on the southern slopes of the Shirak mountain rangeThey create conditions for railways and highways.
  AkhuryanLandslides are strongly expressed in the epoch-making areas of the river, especially in Spitak 1988. after the earthquake.
 Landslides are observed in the region, also in Ashotsk, with an area of ​​60 hectares.
 There are possible outbreaks under the influence of external physical and geographical factorsIn Ashotsk - 1864 ha և In Akhuryan - 620 ha, which are locatedare mainly on the high points of the region.
  Landslides occurNear Vahramaberd, on the Akhuryan plateau, in the Circassian gorge,In Vardbagh և "Crying willows" polling stations.
  Especially dangerousLandslides near the Jajur tunnel, which extend parallel to the railway and highway.
  There were ruins here, which: with floods they cause great damage to the soil structure, they cause soil deterioration.
Preventive measures against landslides, landslides and certain outbreaks of mudslides are associated with a number of land protection, construction works that require financial investment.
The current unsystematic practice of farming greatly contributes to the deterioration of lands in Shirak region.
  The rules of crop rotation, which are considered obligatory in agriculture, are not observed.
  In the region, the soil is often sown under grain crops for 5-6 years in a row.
  Moreover, they are not during that timeThe agro-technical rules of plant care, soil cultivation are observed: annual soil subsidence, weed removal, fertilization.
 As a result, either erosion increases or the soil hardens and becomes weedsfertile field, then its fertility decreases.
The opposite happens when several years in a rowThe field is occupied by intercropping crops, in which case it is disturbedsoil structure, increases the activity of irrigation erosion.
  Regular rotation of crops requiring widespread sowingwith row crops, allows to keep the soil free from hardening, as well as to ensure metabolism in the soilthe normal course.
 From the widely sown crops, alfalfa և corn, which enrich the soil with nitrogen, has a great ability to restore the structure of the soil.
 However, in case of land occupation with these crops, there is an assertion.
The crops mentioned in the crop rotation are the best predecessors of grain crops, and the latter are intercropping.crops.
Shirak region land protection effective useOf particular importance in the general system is the maintenance of natural grasslands, pastures and pastures, and to bring them out of their current deteriorating condition.
 Occupies pastures in the regionThere is a considerable area, which is used by cattle breeders from other regions of the republic.
  Most of the pastures of Shirak are among the good pastures of the republic [5].
 In this sense, the mountainous region of Shirak regionConservation of pastures և plant resources should be considerednational issue, emphasizing the vegetation of the pastures hereoriginality and biodiversity.
There are several reasons for pasture deteriorationare mainly related to their improper use.
 Studies have shown that pastures are mostly overcrowded.
 The normative number of cattle grazed on a unit area exceeds 1.5-2.0 times in Aragats massif.
 In case of overgrazing, the animals in the pastures must first be fully fedif they are not fed, then exposes them under their nostrils,which intensify soil erosion.
 The edible herb, of course,the first becomes vulnerable արի year after year, normal reproductionwithout it, it becomes impoverished and gives way to inedible, sometimes poisonousto grasses.
  In this sense, the pastures near the village suffer the most, where the animals start grazing earlier.
 Often evenThe grass sprouts are destroyed, the plants do not have time to fertilize, so it does nottheir reproduction is ensured.
 And the inedible herb, being somewhat untouchable, appears in favorable conditions ևbecomes the ruling species.
 The process of deterioration of plant species is visibly reflected especially in Aragats.in pastures located on the slopes near the settlements.
The cause of pasture deterioration with overcrowdingIt is an uncoordinated, elemental use together.
 It is known that in pastures spring starts late and lasts short.
  The ground is covered with snowIt is released warmly, and the growth and development of vegetation begin immediately.
 It happens in low-lying pastures in early summer,, thatThis is when the summer grazing season begins.
Young vegetation, especially in small cattleIt is trampled under the bushes, the owners are damaged, the development of vegetation is disturbed.
There is no grazing in the pasturesthe pastures would be quiet, at the same time the vegetation would be strengthened,It would ensure its development, thus increasing pasture productivity.
It is also necessary for the efficient use of pastures. "care: watering, fertilizing, as well as edible grass massdestruction, which is solved to make the grass fully suitablethe problem.
Deterioration of pasture vegetation,In our opinion, it should not be ignored, which seems inconspicuous at first glance, butIn fact, two essential circumstances.
  First, the annual growth of the main, especially the secondary roads that cross the pastures in different directions for the purpose of traffic, which laterbecome furrows, floods and mudslides, eventually becoming a prerequisite for erosionland washes.
 The second important factor is that during summer grazing, especially in rented areas Tents are set up, and their places are often changed.
 After changing the accommodation of the tents and animals, the plant coexistence rapidly deteriorates.
  Edible, juicy, delicious herbsThey are rapidly replaced by stemmed, hardy grasses that have good resistance to adverse conditions.
In order to use pastures effectively, they need to be upgradedtheir productivity, which is conditioned first by the increase of the herb mass, then by the theoretical improvement of that coexistence, that is, by the increase of the specific weight of the edible mass.
 It is necessary to strictly define the pastures in terms of ownership, to demand their maintenance and improvement by law.
Conclusion. Thus, the lands of Shirak region are considered to be endowed with high qualities, a natural resource that plays an important role in the economy.
 But the wrong economic activity of manAs a result, much of that land today is either in dire straitsin a state of disarray, or very quickly decommissioned.
This article proposes land conservation և land usecertain measures that can և it is desirable to apply the currentin economic conditions.
Here, land as a natural resource should be used to its full potential, and its protection and conservation as an integrated part of the environment for any development.should have its place in the program.
 In order to implement land protection and land improvement tasks in Shirak, it is necessary to implement a scientifically substantiated complex program, to organize landsmonitoring by upward zones, as well as to increase the populationAwareness of land conservation and land use.
