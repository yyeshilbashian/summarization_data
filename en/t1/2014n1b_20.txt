One of the priority tasks of pedagogical science is to significantly improve the quality of education by continuously introducing the structural-content components of scientific-research-innovation activity, to meet the modern requirements for the quality of education, to organize the educational-cultural process according to age-individual peculiarities.
The effectiveness of pedagogical activity is characterized by continuous improvement of professional qualities, is largely conditioned by the deepening of the conceptual bases of the educational process.
In the current conditions, the compliance of the pedagogue with the world educational processes, the implementation of the educational policy in line with the geopolitical developments and the elaboration of the strategy for the solution of professional problems are becoming a characteristic characteristic of the pedagogue's professional activity.
The aspects of developing a new concept of education refer to the forms of interaction between the teacher and the student, the formation of the learner's value system, the means of its implementation and the ways.
In the traditional system of education there are not only subject, pedagogical-methodological, but also educational problems, which have been addressed by famous pedagogues, philosophers, psychologists, which have not been solved yet.
The purpose of this article is to present the educational issues that arise especially in the process of educating adolescents, to identify ways to overcome them with the help of pedagogical counseling.
Speaking about the educational issues, let us mention that at present they are of a more acute nature.
 This is due to the fact that in modern conditions, a child's childhood takes place in a society characterized by value deficiency, lack of clear goal orientations, deepening of social stratification, conflicts in children and adolescents, and shortcomings in family upbringing.
It should be added that the difficulties in pedagogical practice arise mainly because one of the communicating parties, the child, in this case the adolescent, is in the stage of self-recognition. requirements.
  Hence the various levels of communication that complicate the transmission of information and personal communication.
 In many cases, the aggressive behavior of adolescents is due to the low level of disciplinary work of the school - the indifference to this phenomenon, sometimes even tolerance, tolerance.
 Still in his time I. Գ. Pestalozzi noted. "The misfortune of the school is that the superficial, insufficient methods of teaching used in it, as well as the whole volume of teaching aids, are not in any way connected with the living principles and views of the practice" [1, pp. 184-185].
Introducing the problems that arise in the educational work of adolescents in modern conditions, which have a negative impact on the effectiveness of the educational process, causing stressful situations, let's touch upon the role of pedagogical counseling in overcoming them և the ways of organization.
Numerous theoretical-practical approaches to pedagogical counseling have been developed abroad, and different models are used for all subjects of pedagogical activity.
According to M. Ն. Pzner, O. Մ. The advice of Zaychenko և others is formulated as: A complex relationship organized by "consultants" "consultants" in a special way, aimed at solving the problems arising from the activities of both the individual and the whole organization, "generating positive changes" [2, p. 9].
 Pedagogical counseling has many components and functions.
 The purpose of our article is to consider the component of pedagogical counseling that involves counseling in child և family work, which includes: • working with “difficult” adolescents to address issues related to their behavior in the educational process; • working with parents who Conflicts with children or teachers, as well as with children in need of socio-pedagogical support.
Introducing the functions of this consulting component, consider the situations that require such consulting work.1. situations that arise due to the difficulty of some children adapting to the classroom staff.
  In such cases, it is necessary to carry out social-pedagogical counseling, which will allow overcoming the complexes of such children, raising their self-esteem.
 In the case of social-pedagogical counseling, the pedagogical counselor may use the strategy of encouragement-directive influence.
 In the case of incentive tactics, the main function of the counselor will be to stimulate the positive behavior of the child, to instill in him / her self-confidence, to assign tasks that will contribute to the manifestation of his / her responsibility.
  These activities will help to establish a classroom connection between the children.
 The directive influence strategy will be used in case the child lacks positive social experience, բաց negative behavioral attitudes prevail, which are usually related to the external environment, social-pedagogical neglect or unfavorable inheritance.
2. In case of parent-child conflict situations, the pedagogue-counselor will work with the parents.
 Coordinating the actions of parents և educators may be involved in supporting the family.
 It is desirable for a difficult child to be in the area of ​​responsibility of either party at all times.
  These efforts are necessary, because even one "problem" child can have a significant impact on other school children.
 The main orientation of family counseling is not to get rid of, but to understand և to support the child, to protect his interests.
 Different models of family counseling have been proposed by various researchers, including S. The "lighting model" was developed by Gordon, N. D. Gidson.
 According to this model, the pedagogue, who gives advice to the family, teaches the parents to diagnose the problematic behavior of the children, to determine their characteristics, to analyze the possible consequences [3, p. 85].
In this case, the educator-counselor can choose the defense strategy, which will be useful in case of conflicts between the parents և between the children։.
  A key condition for the success of this tactic is that the advisor to act in the buffer has a reputation for both parties.
Regardless of the tactics chosen, each counselor will consider ensuring family cohesion as an important indicator of work efficiency.
 The main indicator of cohesion is the value-oriented և material-value unity, which means the degree of development of family relations in which the family members share the goals of the joint activity և values.
3. In case of controversial situations in the process of teacher-student communication, the pedagogue-counselor will work with both the teacher and the student.
 The help of the pedagogue-counselor is that through him the teacher understands the reason for the student's behavior, reveals the motives hidden in the context of his words, actions, և prevents the conflict at its initial stage, and if it has deepened, finds ways to overcome it.
 In such situations, the "Collaborative Conversation" model should be singled out in the activities used by the pedagogue-consultant.
  Introducing the model, let us mention that it includes 2 blocks: psychological and pedagogical.
 The psychological block includes the counselor empathic listening to the counselor, asking open-ended questions, and forming thoughts and feelings.
  The pedagogical block includes the structuring of issues, revealing the position of the consultant, clarifying his role.
The collaborative conversation model is implemented using the following sequential steps.
In the first stage, the teacher introduces the problem to the counselor, who, after listening to the counselor, asks guiding questions that help the teacher to express himself clearly, and the counselor to better understand the teacher's personal characteristics, such as the essence of the problem.
In the second stage, the analysis of the reasons that led to this problematic situation is carried out.
In the third stage, the sequence of tasks that the teacher must perform in order to make changes in his / her working style that contribute to the solution of the problem are discussed.
The fourth stage is the stage of change analysis.
 Changes made as a result of the consultation are analyzed.
The pedagogue-counselor is the mirror in which the pedagogue sees the situation created during his / her student's activity from the point of view of a third person, discovers the mistakes made by both of them, tries to interpret that situation impartially.
The need for pedagogical counseling for the student arises when the child has a desire to communicate something.
  According to O. Ս. According to Gazman, "helping a schoolboy in a difficult situation, so that he learns to solve his own problems on his own, to express himself in everyday difficulties" [4, p. 74].
The assistance of the pedagogue-counselor will be the rehabilitation of children with aggressive behavior, aimed at resolving child conflicts, correcting deviant behavior, getting rid of dangerous habits, addictions, self-realization and self-affirmation.
  American pedagogue և psychologist L. Thorndike states: "We must see change in upbringing… We will bring up someone in upbringing if we do not bring about change in him" [5, p. 25].
Ն. Ն. Mikhailova և S. Մ. Yusfin views pedagogical support as a special pedagogical activity, which differs significantly from teaching and upbringing activities.
According to these authors, the pedagogical support of the child in educational practice "is different strategies of adult activity related to the problem of the child.
  These strategies will provide the conditions for the child's safety when he / she gains his / her own experience, help the child to overcome the emotional feelings of the problem. They contribute to the transfer of the problem in the activity according to his / her solution.
  Through appropriate tactics, pedagogical support carries out the protective, developmental and developmental functions of a particular child ”[6, p. 108].
Among the main forms of counseling used by the counselor-pedagogue to eliminate child aggression, it is necessary to single out both individual and group work.
Individual intervention can be carried out through "instructive", "empirical" models of counseling, which are based on the analysis and interpretation of the behavior of participants in the conflict situation, and group intervention is effective with role-playing games in which behavior is modeled on socially acceptable behaviors.
Considering the models of individual counseling, it should be noted that in the model of "instruction" the pedagogue-consultant assumes the role of the author of the ready instruction, but the ready assignments are less desirable in the sense that they contradict the principles of pedagogical support of the child.
 With all this in mind, it is recommended to use this model only when consulting with children who lack the ability to analyze their own activities and overcome difficulties on their own.
 The consultant developing the "empirical" model should analyze the context of the conditions under which the situation arose.
  D. In the lane. "In order to understand the causes of child aggression, the development of this process is not limited to the study of relationships between stakeholders, but it is necessary to develop complex behavioral models of participants that have some influence on the formation of aggression" [7, p. 255].
For this purpose, the counselor should take into account the individual characteristics of the participants - family experience, school factor - implement the counseling.
Group counseling is carried out through game technology, role-playing games, which is conducted in certain stages. During the initial stage, the participants discuss the situation.
 At the beginning of the next stage, on the assignment of the consultant, the members of the group are given certain roles, which must be presented through game technology.
  In this case, the participants perform the roles that correspond to their status in the given situation.
  During the next stage, the roles will be changed.
  The penultimate stage involves the exchange of views by the participants, during which they, under the guidance of a consultant, conduct a process analysis, developing an idea of ​​self-preservation.
Գ. Niebergal is convinced that the problems presented in the role-playing games provide an opportunity to explain the causes of the problem, the origin of conflicts և the development, leading to emotional feelings [8, p. 15].
Summing up the above-mentioned, we should mention that the pedagogical counseling will ensure the implementation of the joint work of the pedagogical community in the school, the formation of school-family cooperation, the creation of optimal conditions for the child's individual development.
  At the current stage of educational reforms, pedagogical counseling, as an innovation, will bring about positive changes not only in the professional activities of individual educators, the development of student behavior, corrective pedagogy, but also in a more general way to increase the efficiency of the educational process.
Given the fact that nowadays education grows into a factor that contributes to the enhancement of the role of man in society, developing the qualities of coexistence, tolerance, cooperation, then among the issues in this area Accompanying the child, directing actions, eliminating disciplinary deviations, creating a new moral-psychological description of him.
