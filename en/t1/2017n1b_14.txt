Preface.
  Problems in mathematical physics, theory of elasticity, hydrodynamics սովորաբար other fields are usually referred to as differential equations with partial derivatives or ordinary differential equations that need to be integrated if the corresponding terminal or preconditions are present.
  From a practical point of view, digital methods of solving these problems are more interesting, even if they are approximate.
 The so-called direct methods serve this purpose better, which, according to Sobol's definition, when solving the problems of the theory of differential-integral equations, these problems lead to a finite system of algebraic equations.
When using straightforward methods, it is necessary to take into account the fact that in many cases the problem of integrating differential equations can be replaced by the problem of determining the function that has the smallest value equivalent to a given integral.
  The latter is called the variation problem, and the method by which the problem of integrating the differential equation is brought to its equivalent variation problem is the variation method (in the technical literature the variation method is also called the energy method).
 It turns out that most straightforward methods are convenient to use not to integrate the differential equation directly, but to solve the corresponding variation problem.
The variational method for solving term problems became widespread only after the German mathematician Ritz proposed a convenient solution for approximation problems in 1908.
  Ritz's method establishes a direct connection between "variation methods".
Consider the Ritz method for a function of the following form, which is defined on a certain linear set {= {𝑢 𝐿, է is a positive linear operator, and է is a given continuous function.
  It is assumed that 𝐾class functions satisfy the following linear boundary condition, where է is a known linear function, 𝜑 is a given constant value or function.
 Let's be linearly independent functions 𝑢0 (𝑃), 𝑢1 (𝑃,)…. The sequence (հաջորդ), where 𝑢0 (𝑃) satisfies the following heterogeneous condition, and 𝑢𝑖 (𝑃) satisfies the homogeneous edge condition.
We will form the line combination.
Because 𝑢 ∈ 𝐾 for any 𝑐1, 𝑐2,…, 𝑐𝑛 constants.
(1) - (2) Find the approximate solution of the variation problem in (3).
 Place the number (𝑃, 𝑐1, 𝑐2,…, 𝑐𝑛) in the (1) function.
  In this case we get where ն is a known function depending on the variables 𝑐1, 𝑐2,…, 𝑐𝑛 n.
  We will choose the coefficients 𝑐1, 𝑐2,…, այնպես so that 𝐹 [𝑢] is the smallest.
  From this condition we will get the following system for determining the coefficients 𝑐𝑖 (𝑖 = 1, 2,…, 𝑛): = 0.
Putting the obtained coefficients 𝑐𝑖 (𝑖 = 1, 2,…, 𝑛) in relation to (3), we will get the searchable solution.
Thus, the (1) - (2) variation problem is approximated by the search for the extreme of the function Φ (𝑐1, 𝑐2,…, 𝑐𝑛).
  The accuracy of the solution increases as the number of variables in the Φ function increases.
Consider the Ritz method for simple marginal problems.
Suppose a linear differential equation with simple boundary conditions is given, where 𝑝 (𝑥), 𝑞 (𝑥), 𝑓 (𝑥) ∈ 𝐶 [𝑎, 𝑏], and 𝑝 (𝑥)> 0, when 𝑎 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 𝑏.
  (5), (6) the terminal problem is equivalent to the functional variation problem [1], for which (𝐶 𝐶2 [𝑎, 𝑏] և the terminal condition (6) is satisfied.
To solve the variation problem (6), (7) use the Ritz method.
Choose a system of linearly independent functions such that 𝑢0 (𝑎) = 𝐴, 𝑢0 (𝑏) = 𝐵, and the other functions 𝑢𝑖 (𝑥) (𝑖> 0) satisfy the homogeneous boundary conditions: ui (a) = ui (b) = 0 (i = 1, 2,…, n).
Find the solution to the variation problem in the following form, where 𝑐𝑖 (𝑖 = 1, 2,…, 𝑛) are still unknown constants.
It is obvious that solution (8) satisfies the given boundary conditions, ie 𝑦 (𝑎) = 𝐴, 𝑦 (𝑏) = 𝐵.
Choose the coefficients 𝑐1, 𝑐2,…, այնպես so that the function 𝑦 (𝑥) is in the extreme (7) of the function.
 Putting relation (8) in formula (7), we get where ՝ (𝑐1, 𝑐2,…, 𝑐𝑛) is a quadratic function with respect to the variables 𝑐1, 𝑐2,…,։.
 It is known that in order for 𝛷 (𝑐1, 𝑐2,…, 𝑐𝑛) to have a differential function in the extreme at certain values ​​of 𝑐1, 𝑐2,…,,, the conditions (4) must be satisfied.
(4) the system is linear, with respect to the search coefficients 𝑐1, ,2,…,,, and the number of equations is equal to the number of unknowns.
  Solving the system (4), we find the coefficients 𝑐1, 𝑐2,…, 𝑐𝑛 (𝑖 = 1,2,…, n), from which, placing the latter in relation to (8), we will find the solution of the variation problem (6), (7) և respectively: (5), (6) the solution of the terminal problem.
 Note that the accuracy of the problem-solving depends on the linearly independent selection of functions և it increases with increasing number.
Let us now consider specific problems that we will solve with the Ritz method, then with the exact method, we will make an accurate numerical comparison of approximate solutions using the table.
Problem 1. The given functionality in case of marginal conditions.
 It is required to find the 𝑦 = 𝑦 (𝑥) function that will give the given functionality a minimum.
Solution) Ritz method: (9), (10) Find the solution of the variation problem in (8), where ից 𝑢𝑖 (𝑥) ից select the base functions that will satisfy: 𝑦 (0) = 𝑦 (1) = 0, homogeneous edge conditions, they are: 𝑢𝑖 (𝑥) = (𝑥 - 1) 𝑥𝑖, (𝑖 = 1, 2,…).
In case n = 1, we get: 1 (𝑥) = 𝐶1 (2𝑥 - 1).
By placing 1 (𝑥) in the given functionality, we will get:
= 𝜙 (𝐶1).
We find the coefficient 𝐶1 from the equation = 0.
Therefore: (𝑥2 - 𝑥).
In case n = 2 we will have: 2 (𝑥) = 𝐶1 (2𝑥 - 1) + 𝐶2 (3𝑥2 - 2𝑥).
Putting 2 (𝑥) in the functionality, we get:
Using 2 = 𝜙 (𝐶1, 𝐶2).
= 0 conditions, we will get the following system, from where we will determine the coefficients 𝐶1, 𝐶2: Therefore: ⇒ 𝐶1 = 0,189, 𝐶2 = 0,175.
𝑦2 (𝑥) = 0.189 (𝑥2 - 𝑥) + 0.175 (𝑥3 - 𝑥2).
b) Correct solution. To solve the given variation problem by the exact method, we use the Euler-Lagrange equation [2]: 𝜕𝑦 ′) = 0.
In this case, then, the Euler-Lagrange equation would be: (2𝑦 ′) = 0 ⇒ 𝑦 ′ ′ + 𝑦 - 𝑥 = 0.
It turns out that it is necessary to solve the linear heterogeneous equation with constant coefficients 𝑦 ′ ′ + 𝑦 - 𝑥 = 0 in the case of the boundary conditions 𝑦 (0) = 𝑦 (1) = 0.
 The solution of the latter will be: 𝑦 = 𝑥 -
.

𝑦 (2) = in case of 0 boundary conditions.
  Find the 𝑦 (𝑥) function that will give the selected functionality a minimum.
Solution a) Ritz method. We take as basic functions, since the boundary conditions are satisfied.
In case 𝒏 =։, according to the formula we will get: 1 (𝑥) = 𝐶1 (2𝑥 - 2).
By placing 1 (𝑥) in the given functionality, we will get:
𝑦1 (𝑥) և 𝑦 𝑦
= 𝜙 (𝐶1).
The coefficient 𝐶1 is found by: և1 (𝑥) =
In case 𝒏 = անք we will get (𝑥2 - 2𝑥).
= 0 from the equation.
2 (𝑥) = 𝐶1 (2𝑥 - 2) + 𝐶2 (3𝑥2 - 4𝑥).
𝑦2 (𝑥) և 𝑦 𝑦
Putting 2 (𝑥) in the functional և using = 0, we will determine the conditions 𝐶1, 𝐶2 coefficients: 𝐶1 = 0,204, 𝐶2 = 0,152.
Therefore: 𝑦2 (𝑥) = 0,204 (𝑥2 - 2𝑥) + 0,152 (𝑥3 - 2𝑥2).
In case 𝒏 = կստ we will get տեղադր (𝑥) by putting տեղադր in the function և using 𝑦3 (𝑥) 𝑦 𝑦3
= 0 conditions, we get the constants 𝐶1, 𝐶2, 𝐶3:
Then (𝑥4 - 2𝑥3).
b) Correct solution. In this case, the Euler-Lagrange equation will be: 𝑦 ′ ′ - 𝑦 = 𝑥.
The latter is a linear heterogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients, which by solving we will get: 𝑦 = 𝐶1𝑒𝑥 + 𝐶2𝑒 − 𝑥 - 𝑥.
Satisfying the term condition 𝑦 (0) = 𝑦 (1) = 0, we get:
Putting the values ​​of the coefficients 𝐶1, 𝐶2 in the solution 𝑥, we will get: 𝑥.
c) Comparison of numerical values ​​of "exact" approximate solutions. Table 2 shows իտ1 (𝑥), 𝑦2 (𝑥) obtained by Ritz method,
𝑦3 (𝑥) approximate solutions 𝑦 𝑦 (𝑥) the exact solution.
Comparison of accurate և approximate solutions Table 2 Conclusion.
  The simplest boundary problems observed can be solved by the exact method և the approximate method (Ritz method), then the numerical comparison made for those methods shows in practice that as the number of basic functions increases, the approximate solution of the problem approaches the exact solution.
