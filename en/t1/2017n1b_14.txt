Preface.
  Problems in mathematical physics, theory of elasticity, hydrodynamics և other fields are usually broughtdifferential equations with partial derivatives or ordinarydifferential equations that need to be integrated into the problemin the presence of appropriate marginal or preconditions.
  From a practical point of view, these problems are more interestingNumerical methods of solution, even if they are approximate.
 To that endbest served are the so-called direct methods, which, according toSobol definition, theory of differential-integral equationsThese problems lead to the approximate solution of problemsthe finite system of algebraic equations.
When using direct methods, it is necessary to take into account oneThe most important fact is, in many cases, differential equationsThe problem of integration can be replaced by the problem of determining the function that has the least value equivalent to a given integral.
  The latteris called a variation problem, and the method by which the problem of integrating the differential equation is brought to it is equivalent to a variationThe problem is the variation method (in the technical literature the variation method is also called the energy method).
 It turns out that direct methodsmost of them are convenient to use not for the integration of the direct differential equation directly, but for the solution of the corresponding variation problem.
The variational method of solving edge problems is widespreadreceived only after the German mathematician in 1908Ritz suggested a convenient solution to the variation problemfor a solution.
  Ritz's method establishes a direct connection directly ևbetween variation methods.
Consider the Ritz method for the following functionality:which is determined by a certain linear set 𝐾 = {𝑢,, դրական is a positive linear setis an operator, and է is a given continuous function.
  It is supposed that 𝐾The class functions satisfy the following linear boundary condition:where է is a known linear function, տր is a given constant valueor function.
 Let's be linearly independent functions 𝑢0 (𝑃), 𝑢1 (𝑃,)…. , 𝑢𝑛 (𝑃)
the sequence where 𝑢0 (𝑃) satisfies the following heterogeneousterm condition: and 𝑢𝑖 (𝑃):the homogeneous marginal condition.
Let's compilelinear combination.
Sincethen 𝑢 ∈ 𝐾 for any 𝑐1, 𝑐2,…, 𝑐𝑛 constants.
(1) - (2) Find the approximate solution of the variation problem in (3).
 Its:Put 𝑢 (𝑃, 𝑐1, 𝑐2,…, 𝑐𝑛) in function (1).
  In that casewe will get:where ն is a known function depending on the variables 𝑐1, 𝑐2,…, 𝑐𝑛 n.
  We will choose the coefficients 𝑐1, 𝑐2,…, այնպես so that 𝐹 [𝑢] is the smallest.
  From this condition we get the determination of the coefficients 𝑐𝑖 (𝑖 = 1, 2,…, 𝑛)for the following system:= 0.
The resulting coefficients 𝑐𝑖 (𝑖 = 1, 2,…, 𝑛) by placing the relation (3)In it, we will get the searchable solution.
Thus, the problem of (1) - (2) variation is approximatedSearch for the extreme of the function Φ (𝑐1, 𝑐2,…, 𝑐𝑛).
  The accuracy of the solutionincreases with the number of variables in the Φ function.
Consider the Ritz method for simple marginal problems.
Let's say it is given linear differential equationwith simple boundary conditions where 𝑝 (𝑥), 𝑞 (𝑥), 𝑓 (𝑥) ∈ 𝐶 [𝑎, 𝑏], where𝑝 (𝑥)> 0, when 𝑎 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 𝑏.
  (5), (6) the term problem is equivalentto the functional variation problem [1], for which եզր 𝐶 [2 [𝑎, 𝑏] (satisfies the term condition (6).
To solve the variation problem (6), (7) use the Ritz method.
Choose a system of linearly independent functions:so 𝑢0 (𝑎) = 𝐴, 𝑢0 (𝑏) = 𝐵, and the other functions 𝑢𝑖 (𝑥) (𝑖> 0),satisfy homogeneous marginal conditions:ui (a) = ui (b) = 0 (i = 1, 2,…, n).
Find the solution to the variation problem as follows:where 𝑐𝑖 (𝑖 =, 1, 2,…, 𝑛) are still unknown constants.
It is obvious that solution (8) satisfies the given boundary conditions;that is, 𝑦 (𝑎) = 𝐴, 𝑦 (𝑏) = 𝐵.
Choose the coefficients 𝑐1, 𝑐2,…, այնպես so that the function 𝑦 (𝑥) givesin the extreme (7) functional.
 By inserting relation (8) into formula (7):we will get:where 𝛷 (𝑐1, 𝑐2,…, 𝑐𝑛) is a quadratic function with respect to the variables 𝑐1, 𝑐2,…,։.
 It is known that the function 𝛷 (𝑐1, 𝑐2,…, դի) toIn case of certain values ​​of 𝑐1, 𝑐2,…, ունեն to have in the extreme, it is necessaryto meet (4) conditions.
(4) the system is linear with respect to the search coefficients 𝑐1, 𝑐2,…,,;and the number of equations is equal to the number of unknowns.
  Solving:(4) system: find the coefficients 𝑐1, 𝑐2,…, 𝑐𝑛 (𝑖 = 1,2,…, n), after whichPutting the latter in relation to (8), we will find (6), (7) variationssolution of the problem և followed by (5), (6) the solution of the term problem.
 Note that the problemThe accuracy of the solution depends on the choice of linearly independent functions,և it increases with their number.
Now let's look at some specific problems that we can solve with the Ritz method,then with the exact method միջոցով we will do it accurately through the table ևNumerical comparison of approximate solutions.
Problem 1. Given:
functional:in case of marginal conditions.
 You need to find the function 𝑦 = 𝑦 (𝑥),which will give the given functionality a minimum.
Solutiona) Ritz method.(9), (10) find the solution to the variation problem in (8), where {𝑢𝑖 (𝑥)}From the system of linearly independent functions, select the base functions that will satisfy: 𝑦 (0) = 𝑦 (1) = 0, the homogeneous boundary conditions are:𝑢𝑖 (𝑥) = (𝑥 - 1) 𝑥𝑖, (𝑖 = 1, 2,…).
In case n = 1, we get:1 (𝑥) = 𝐶1 (2𝑥 - 1).
By placing 1 (𝑥) in the given functionality, we will get:
= 𝜙 (𝐶1).
We find the coefficient 𝐶1= 0 from the equation.
Therefore:(𝑥2 - 𝑥).
In case n = 2 we will have:2 (𝑥) = 𝐶1 (2𝑥 - 1) + 𝐶2 (3𝑥2 - 2𝑥).
Putting 2 (𝑥) in the functionality, we get:
Using:2 = 𝜙 (𝐶1, 𝐶2).
= 0 conditions, we will get the following system, from which we will determine the coefficients 𝐶1, 𝐶2:Therefore:⇒ 𝐶1 = 0.189, 𝐶2 = 0.175.
𝑦2 (𝑥) = 0.189 (𝑥2 - 𝑥) + 0.175 (𝑥3 - 𝑥2).
b) Accurate solution.We use it to solve the given variation problem in an accurate wayFrom the Euler – Lagrange equation [2]𝜕𝑦 ′) = 0.
In this case ,Therefore, the Euler-Lagrange equation would be:(2𝑦 ′) = 0 ⇒ 𝑦 ′ ′ + 𝑦 - 𝑥 = 0.
It turns out that it is necessary to solve the linear heterogeneous equation with constant coefficients 𝑦 ′ ′ + 𝑦 - 𝑦 = 0 𝑦 (0) = 𝑦 (1) = 0in case of marginal conditions.
 The solution of the latter will be: 𝑦 = 𝑥 -

𝑦 (2) = in case of 0 boundary conditions.
  Find the 𝑦 (𝑥) function that:will give the given functionality a minimum.
Solution a) Ritz method.As basic functions we take:as the marginal conditions are satisfied.
In the case of 𝒏 =,, by:We will receive a resolution:1 (𝑥) = 𝐶1 (2𝑥 - 2).
By placing 1 (𝑥) in the given functionality, we will get:
𝑦1 (𝑥) և 𝑦 𝑦
= 𝜙 (𝐶1).
We find the coefficient 𝐶1Therefore: 𝑦1 (𝑥) =
In case 𝒏 = կստ we will get:(𝑥2 - 2𝑥).
= 0 from the equation.
2 (𝑥) = 𝐶1 (2𝑥 - 2) + 𝐶2 (3𝑥2 - 4𝑥).
𝑦2 (𝑥) և 𝑦 𝑦
By placing 2 (𝑥) մեջ in the functionality և using = 0, we will determine the conditions 𝐶1, 𝐶2 coefficients:𝐶1 = 0.204, 𝐶2 = 0.152.
Therefore:𝑦2 (𝑥) = 0.204 (𝑥2 - 2𝑥) + 0.152 (𝑥3 - 2𝑥2).
In case 𝒏 = կստ we will get:By placing ′ (𝑥) in the functionality using: 𝑦3 (𝑥) 𝑦 :3:
= 0 conditions, we get the constants 𝐶1, 𝐶2, 𝐶3:.
Therefore:(𝑥4 - 2𝑥3).
b) Accurate solution.In this case, the Euler-Lagrange equation would be:𝑦 ′ ′ - 𝑦 = 𝑥.
The latter is a linear heterogeneous differential with constant coefficientsequation, which by solving we will get:𝑦 = 𝐶1𝑒𝑥 + 𝐶2𝑒 − 𝑥 - 𝑥.
Satisfying the term 𝑦 (0) = 𝑦 (1) = 0, we get:.
Putting the values ​​of the coefficients 𝐶1, 𝐶2 in the solution 𝑦, we will get:- 𝑥.
