The pedagogical process is aimed at solving the educational problems of the next generation, revealing and developing the abilities and personal qualities of the students.
  It is dynamic in nature և variable.
 The whole pedagogical process consists of this or that pedagogical situation encountered during the pedagogical activity, which needs to be solved, corrected, regulated.
 Many situations encountered in the pedagogical process turn into pedagogical problems, prompting teachers, students and their parents to analyze the situation, evaluate the proposed solutions, choose the best option, and develop an implementation plan.
 It is very possible that the teaching teachers pay attention to any pedagogical situation, show the right approach, give a solution to the problematic situation according to the purpose of the pedagogical process, the nature of the pedagogical situation, the age peculiarities of the students, etc.
  Any pedagogical problem encountered in the pedagogical process puts a stamp on it, it has a great influence on the further development of the students, especially that influence is very strong, it is obvious in the elementary school.
Most pedagogical situations are problematic.
 We face a pedagogical problem when the problematic pedagogical situation can have several solutions; it is necessary to find the method that in this case will lead to an effective solution of the problem.
The importance of pedagogical problems, the issue of their educational significance, was addressed by such educators as MA Danilov, LL Dodon, VI Zagvyazinski, VA Slastyonin, IF Isa and others.
The pedagogical problem, according to famous pedagogues VA Slastyonin, I. F. Isa's meaningful pedagogical situation, the goal of which is the knowledge and transformation of reality [7, pp. 504-505].
Thus, when we say pedagogical problem, we often mean the pedagogical situation created by the teacher or students, which feels the need for analysis, correction, regulation.
Different problems are observed and studied in the system of different sciences.
 When we say problem, we often mean: • a task or assignment, • a problem that needs to be solved, • a set goal that needs to be accomplished, and so on.
In the case of natural sciences, regardless of the circumstances, the answer to the problem is always the same if the problem is solved correctly.
  In case of pedagogical problems, the solution may change.
 The process of solving the problem can change depending on different circumstances, it is possible, when, with whom, for what reasons, etc.
Back in the 60s of the last century, Russian pedagogue LD Dodon, emphasizing the role and significance of pedagogical problems, considered that in solving a pedagogical problem it was necessary to evaluate a specific fact, identify the motives of the pedagogue or students' behavior, point out the way out of the pedagogical complex. to find the right solution to a specific problem [5, p. 9].
The process and effectiveness of solving the pedagogical problem is greatly influenced by who solves that problem.
 The organization of the pedagogical process, its efficiency, as well as the correct solution of the pedagogical problem largely depends on the pedagogue, his professional and personal qualities, the pedagogical mastery of the teacher.
 The master teacher is always able to find a way out of all the difficult pedagogical situations, to answer the students' unexpected questions.
 A teacher with pedagogical skills deeply understands what to do, how to do it in order to achieve a high goal.
 Pedagogical communication is very important in a teacher's mastery, which can be considered as a teacher's professional influence on students in order to create easy-to-trust relationships.
The effectiveness of solving pedagogical problems can be ensured հասնել to achieve high results, relying on the following starting points: • Convenience: taking into account the patterns of natural development of children, strengthening their mental health; Life activities: Involvement of children in solving their own problems in real life; • Cooperation: uniting the goals of children և adults, coordination of actions, mutual support and mutual assistance [4, p.
In case of pedagogical problems, the problem cannot be solved immediately. It is a long process consisting of several stages.
  First of all, it is necessary to analyze all the data.
 The first possible step in solving a pedagogical problem is to analyze the situation and realize what the cause of the situation is, when and under what conditions it occurred, what characteristics and relationships the students and educators have with the situation, and what problem all this poses.
If this step is ignored, it is impossible to fully study the problematic situation and give the right solution to the problem.
The next stage of solving the pedagogical problem is the choice of the solution method, when the pedagogue chooses the solution method corresponding to the given problem from his / her knowledge base and his / her pedagogical experience, analyzing and evaluating the adopted decision.
  In order to solve the problem, the pedagogue can first talk to the student, if necessary, his parents, consult with other pedagogues who work with the child or have more experience.
 The final stage of solving the pedagogical problem is the implementation of the corresponding solution and the analysis of the results [7, pp. 509-511].
Thus, the solution of pedagogical problems is carried out in the following stages: • analysis of the pedagogical situation, • awareness of the problem, • choice of the method of problem solving, • implementation of the problem solution, • analysis of the results.
The beginning of a difficult process of correcting and regulating difficult pedagogical situations, solving pedagogical problems is set in the elementary school, as it is considered the beginning of children's educational activities.
Each age stage is characterized by certain pedagogical situations and pedagogical problems arising from those situations, based on the age characteristics of the students.
Junior school age is a period of transition, when the child has both "pre-school" and "school" characteristics.
At this age the child must be ready not only to acquire knowledge, but also to change the content of the whole life, which in turn causes certain difficulties.
 Junior high school students may face difficulties due to the child's unusual school routine, relationships with teachers, classmates, and family members, as well as lack of interest and frustration with school and the pedagogical process [2, pp. 84-93].
Most of the children of primary school age will be characterized by a number of features.
 Thus, the primary school students. • are irritable, quick to get excited, often remember parents in class (in this case it is necessary to distract children with interesting topics, work, give assignments, tasks, using the role of the student), • are inquisitive, want to know everything (need to be patient, answer All questions, detailed and accessible explanation), • get tired and bored quickly (it is necessary to keep children in an active role during lessons, constantly changing their work style, including interesting games, competitions, various physical exercises), • are quickly impressed and insecure (assignments should be given taking into account the level of mental and physical readiness of children, excluding bad content and ending materials)
The above-mentioned age peculiarities often lead to such difficult pedagogical situations, which require immediate solution.
 Their correct solution can have a direct impact on the child's future, his behavior, inner world, worldview, etc.
As a result of the study of pedagogical literature we can generalize և separate a number of pedagogical rules, which can significantly affect the efficiency of the pedagogical process.
  When solving various pedagogical problems, a positive result can be achieved if the following rules are followed: • Do not see a negative motive in every bad action, be optimistic, show a humanitarian approach, because relying on a negative level can only deepen the complex conflict situation. should be more effective, because direct remarks, threats can cause resentment and resentment, • correct, literate և reasonably assess the students' personality, excluding overestimation and underestimation, as each of them can leave a negative mark, • joint activities bring people closer to student-student as well as student-teacher cooperation, • pedagogical delicacy and mastery;A little humor prevents conflict.
Let us now present an example of some pedagogical problems encountered in elementary school, giving some possible solutions to them.
Problem 1.
• Analysis of the pedagogical situation.
  One of the first-graders did not attend classes without his mother.
 She started crying when she was away from her mother.
• Awareness of the problem.
  The teacher, realizing the seriousness of the given pedagogical situation, tries to solve the problem as soon as possible, creating positive learning motivations in the student, involving him in various activities.
• Implementation of problem solving.
  Initially, the teacher invited her mother to classes.
 Then, gradually, using various pretexts, the teacher would send the student's mother out of the classroom, and during that time she would give the student interesting assignments to divert attention so that the mother's absence would not be noticed.
  So, after a while, the mother started waiting for the child in the corridor, then in the school yard.
• Results analysis.
 Due to the above-mentioned approach, the problem was solved and the child was fully involved in the pedagogical process.
Problem 2.
• Analysis of the pedagogical situation.
  The second grade teacher noticed that some of the students in her class were learning the lesson, but they did not raise their hands, or when asked, they either did not answer or spoke with constraint and fear.
• Awareness of the problem.
  Faced with the following pedagogical problem, the teacher tries to work out ways to solve the situation, pushing the students to be active and independent.
• Implementation of problem solving.
  The teacher constantly engaged the students in the field of work, where a relaxed atmosphere was created, the children were able to express their thoughts and feelings, to feel the role of their own person in the classroom, and so on.
• Results analysis.
 After a while the situation improves.
The children's fear disappears, the students understand that it is possible to express their thoughts freely, that they can even make mistakes, not to be punished in confusion, that in that case they remain loved by the teacher and enjoy authority.
Problem 3.
• Analysis of the pedagogical situation.
The third grade teacher notices that the children in her class are not friendly, help each other, do not give their things to friends, do not trust each other.
• Awareness of the problem.
 To solve this problem, the teacher often uses the technology of collective learning, promoting the cooperation of students.
• Implementation of problem solving.
 The teacher deliberately creates a situation where it is necessary to either give her own things to a friend, or work together on the same thing, study with one book, the transmitter, and so on.
 To set an example, the teacher sometimes gives things to one of the students.
• Results analysis.
 Such activities helped to unite the student body, becoming a cooperating և supporter.
The presented pedagogical problems may have other solutions, because the pedagogical problem, in contrast to other problems, for example, a mathematical problem, has many solutions and different "answers".
In the pedagogical process there are both the above-mentioned and many other pedagogical situations that need to be solved.
  In addition to the many pedagogical situations that are spontaneously created in the pedagogical process, teachers և students can also create pedagogical problems that pursue a specific goal, taking into account their importance and impact in the process of teaching and educating students.
  Due to the problematic pedagogical situations, it is possible to find answers to many questions, contributing to the increase of the efficiency of the educational process.
pedagogical situations are composed both by the teacher and the students either.
