As we know, in classical mechanics, among all the integrals of the physical system motion, the kinematic (asymptotically) integrals are especially used.
  The latter are related to the invariance of the description of the system with respect to the group of seven rotations of symmetry (one temporal motion, three spatial motions և three spatial rotations).
 So for closed systems there are seven conserved quantities corresponding to spatial-temporal variations.
In particular, the symmetry with respect to temporal motion is equivalent to the existence of an asymptotically additive integral of energy.
  Homogeneity changes in isotropy and isotropy lead to the exact additive to the laws of conservation of momentum և momentum.
Poisson's quantum (classical) parentheses serve as a convenient mathematical apparatus for establishing conservation laws in quantum (classical) mechanics.
  However, for a more complete understanding of the physical image, it is methodologically justified to refer to the fundamental questions of the laws of conservation related to the properties of space-time symmetry from the quantum-mechanical point of view of particle-wave duality.
In classical physics, at the basis of particle-wave notions, the principle of their sharp contrast is emphasized, according to which particles have inherent signs of interruption, and waves, on the contrary, are endowed with definitions of continuity.
 Thus, the categories of interruption and continuity play a key role in understanding the essence of particle-wave formations of physical objects.
The latter, in turn, are correspondingly connected with the realities of uncertainty and certainty of values.
 Thus, for example, a force field observed as a constant object is characterized by a certain value of tension at each point in the field, and, conversely, the intermittent position-motion uncertainty (principle of uncertainty) is characteristic of the particle.
 At the same time, it is the idea of ​​the objective reality of the force field (electromagnetic, gravitational) that plays a crucial role in smoothing the sharp particle-wave sharp contrast, proving the inextricable link between the physical realities of intermittent field sources (charge, mass).
  Thus, even in classical physics, the existence of a deep connection between the opposing realities of interruption, that is, particles, waves, their motions, was emphasized, but, nevertheless, their unity was not yet confirmed.
  The notion of such unity is one of the achievements of quantum physics, Դ De Bruyl պատ պատ պատ։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։
The appearance of corpuscular or corrugated properties in natural objects is derived from the magnitude of their mass, velocity values, and is therefore related to the various interactions between the relative relations.
 It means the possibility of applying the ideas of a particle or a wave to the same physical object, the reality of the latter being "identical" and different, outside of unity and interchangeability.
Of particular interest in this regard is the attempt to substantiate the laws of conservation of corpuscular parameters (energy, momentum, momentum), which play a fundamental role in motion, within the framework of wave notions, the basis of which is the general spatio-temporal symmetry for both particles and waves.
1. Energy
An opportunity to interpret the motion of particles as a wave process is the experimentally observed realities of the diffraction և interference of matter, which are characteristic only of wave motion.
  Widely known experiments of electron diffraction record time-stable sequences of interference maxima և minimums, spatially unchanged, scattered positions of the constructive-destructive domains of interference.
 In particular, the stability of the interference image over time is a constant, time-dependent difference between the phases of the repetitive wave processes, which in turn proves the absence of Debroil wave phased velocities, a clear dependence on time.
  And this can be observed outside the symmetry conditioned by the homogeneity of time.
In order to obtain the expected result from the underlined reality, let us consider the Debroil smooth harmonic wave, which characterizes the partisan state of free motion with a certain "impulse" energy.
 Let us make a contradictory assumption as a baseline hypothesis, taking into account that the apparent dependence of the phase velocity of wave (1) on time can be conditioned only by the dependence 𝜔 = 𝜔 (𝑡).
  Indeed, for simplicity, consider that (1) wave propagates along the axis Ox.
 x - The velocity of the phase shift (phase velocity) with a coordinate point will be determined from the condition.
 That is, in the case of "heterogeneous" time (1), the phase velocity of the wave will be expressed.
 𝑉𝑓 The apparent apparent dependence of phase velocity on time is expressed by the second term to the right of (2).
The exclusion of such a dependence, which derives directly from the temporality, results in մասին the total energy of the free particle being stored over time 𝐸 (𝑡) = 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡. to the conclusion.
  That is, a certain E value of energy specific to the steady state of the quantum system (free particle) is stored over time.
Let us now consider the question of energy conservation for non-stationary states from a wave perspective, analyzing the implications of the quantum-mechanical principle of state return.
In this case it is the non-stationary state described by the object function of the discussion, where in the Debroil flat wave stationary state the particle is endowed with certain values ​​of energy ի number of motion, respectively.
 However, the same cannot be said of the non-stationary (3) superimposed state, when the motion of a particle is not defined by certain values ​​of the energy Impulse.
 In particular, at պահին = 0 at 𝜓 in the 𝜓 state և energy և motion (5), the measurement will reveal only the probabilities | 𝑎1 | 2, | 𝑎2 | 2,… [[2].
Represent the wave function of the superimposed (3) state in the following view: where 𝑉𝑓1 =
The following appointments have been made: ,…. (4) The phase velocities of the waves are և𝐶1 (𝑡) = 𝑎1𝑒 − 𝑖𝜔1𝑡, 𝐶2 (𝑡) = 𝑎2𝑒 − 𝑖𝜔2𝑡,….
(6) it is clear from the representation that if the temporal dependence of 𝑉𝑓1, 𝑉𝑓2,… phase velocities is excluded by the homogeneity of time, then (6) will be an analysis of the Ψ wavefunction 𝑡 orthogonalized 𝑒𝑖𝑘1𝑟, 𝑒𝑖𝑘2𝑟,… system of functions, which (7) The squares of the modulus of the coefficients will have իմաստ moment Ψ in the state Ψ state of motion և as a result of measuring the probabilities of discovering the values ​​of the energy values ​​(5).
 However, at the same time 𝑎1, 𝑎2, չեն do not depend on time.
 That is, the probabilities of detecting values ​​at any moment (5) are constant in measurement անկախ independent of time.
 The average value of energy in all possible quantum (4) states is the same.
Thus, the arbitrary value of the mean energy վիճակում վիճակում 〈in the arbitrary state of the quantum system, as well as the probabilities of detecting certain 𝐸𝑛 values ​​of energy in measurement, do not depend on time as a direct consequence of the homogeneity of time.
  The observation of the interpretation of the law of conservation of energy, in our opinion, is not of a symbolic nature, in contrast to the accepted formulations made by the operator representation (through Poisson's quantum brackets), although it is in line with the latter.
The expression Debroil smooth harmonic wave (1), as we know, occurs for arbitrary velocities of a particle.
  However, in the case of relativistic velocities, phenomena of reciprocal transformations of particles become possible, bringing about changes in their number and type.
  For the sake of simplicity, wishing to confine ourselves to the case of a single variable particle, it remains to be assumed that it moves at a non-relativistic speed (𝑣 ≪։).
 In such a boundary case for a particle 𝐸 ≈ 𝑚0𝑐2 + +
= 𝐸0 + 𝐾, that is, we come to the obvious conclusion that the conservation of kinetic energy of a particle [3].
In the presence of external stationary fields, the external average effect on the non-relativistic motion of a particle, as we know, is described as 𝑈 = 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡. with constant potential energy input.
 That is, the compatibility of the idea of ​​particle-wave duality makes it possible to match a particle moving in the 𝑈 ≠ 0 domain with a Debroylan smooth harmonic wave of dispersion ′ ′ =
 by law.
 The legitimacy of such a generalization, as it is known, has been repeatedly proved experimentally.
  Moreover, it can be used to some extent in the case of a field with smoothly changing potential.
It is obvious that the homogeneity of time in this case և excludes the possibility of obvious dependence on time 𝜔 ′ = ′ ′ (𝑡), which leads to the fact of preserving the full mechanical energy of the particle. That is, 2. Impulse
The experimentally observed changing position of the interference image of material waves in space indicates the absence of a phase velocity, a clear dependence on spatial coordinates.
  This time, let us assume the possibility of the dependence of 𝑘 = 𝑘 (𝑡) with a contradictory assumption, which will lead to the condition of the phase stability of (0 = (- of the wave ությանը in the expression of heterogeneous space (1) of the phase velocity of the wave.
It is obvious that the exclusion of բացահայտ's explicit dependence on spatial coordinates, which results from the homogeneity of space, results in the conservation of the free particle momentum.
3. Angular moment
Experiments of microparticle interference, in addition to spatio-temporal homogeneity, show the obvious invariance of the results of the wave return to spatial rotations, which, due to the isotropy of space, is a consequence of symmetry.
  That is, it remains to be seen under what condition the magnitude of the phase velocity of the debril wave does not depend on the direction of wave propagation (wave vector) in lignite (the velocity of the phase velocity on the magnitude of the wave vector determines the dispersion of debril waves even in emptiness).
Here it is meant that the states of free motion of a particle can be represented as either (1) flat waves or spherical waves, since the case of a free particle with potential energy 𝑈 (𝑟) = 0 can also be considered as an example of a centrifugal problem.
  So a certain magnitude և projection of a right angular moment can be attributed to a particle in the discussed states of free motion.
 (1) at the point ալի of the wave, 𝑡 at the moment of phase shift 𝑓 𝑓 =
  velocity (phase velocity) will be determined from the condition.
𝑘պր.
𝑘պր.
where Tspr. - is the projection of the wave vector in the direction of։։.
Չէ does not depend on the direction of wave propagation: 𝑉𝑓 (1 - 1) = 𝑉𝑓 (2 - 2), ie it is invariant with respect to the spatial rotation with angle 𝛿𝜑 → 0, where 𝑘′⃑⃑⃑ = 𝑘⃑ + 𝛿𝑘⃑, 𝛿𝑘⃑ = [𝛿𝜑⃑ ∙ 𝑘⃑].
The infinitely small rotation 𝛿𝜑⃑ vector is directed perpendicular to the plane of the plot along the axis of rotation.
Thus, Taking into account where the second term on the right, according to the vectors ՝ 𝑓 𝑘⃑ 𝑘⃑, 𝛿𝜑⃑ 𝑘⃑ 𝑘⃑, we get: (𝑟 ∙ [𝛿𝜑⃑ ∙ 𝑘⃑]) = 0.
Subject the left part to cyclic displacement. Since է is a constant vector, then𝐿⃑ = 0.
 That is, the isotropy of space determines the maintenance of the momentum vector of motion over time.
