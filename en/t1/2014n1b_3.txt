In Armenian literature H. Numerous valuable works and articles were dedicated to Tumanyan, but in the field of comprehensive discovery and evaluation of Tumanyan's poetic world, particularly language, the opinions expressed during his lifetime did not become the subject of a separate study, which reveal not only Tumanyan's linguistic thinking,
 The issue of qualitative changes in the development of Tumanyan's language is beyond the scope of our study.
Our task is to look at the historical perspective of when he proposed this or that point of view characterizing the language of the poet's works, to emphasize the views and discoveries of the time, which not only clarified the peculiarities of the language, but also outlined the place of the language of Tumanyan's works. in the development of the Eastern Armenian literary language.
It is noteworthy that the first evaluators of the language of Tumanyan's work were the members of the "five", who indirectly became his first "critics".
 "In 1887 a circle of acquaintances fell, who found the language vulgar," Tumanyan writes, "and advised you to take up the savage dialect and use the literary language ..." [5,421].
  The young man with a deep sense of the vernacular is somewhat behind the advice of others.
 A. Chltchyan writes that over time Tumanyan often changed his poems to get rid of dialectal influence.
 It is not known: J. Aghayan and P. Proshyan, who were familiar with Tumanyan's first manuscript works, what was their opinion about their language?
 "From the side facts it can be concluded that they treated the language of the young poet in a completely universal way" [10,9], - writes S. Melkonyan.
What, 1890? The first collection "Poems" is published.
 "Nor-Dar" publishes the first serious review, the author of which, M. Abeghyan, generally highly appreciates the poetic language. "Tumanyan, like our other poets, does not know how to confuse his writing with unnecessary words, in a fluffy and decorative style ..." [16].
 The reviewer emphasizes the begging of the language with the living folk speech. "That language breathes with the vitality of the folk language, just as the material itself is taken from the folk life.
 It is rare to see a regular language in our verses, but the language of its verses is mostly regulated, especially the language of "Mehri", which has very few irregularities. "[16]
Abeghyan appreciates Tumanyan's ability to create images, noticing some "dark phrases".
 However, the critic insightfully emphasizes the features that are typical of the poet's language, highly appreciating the path he is following.
    L. Manvelyan also positively assesses the scenes of the poems described in carefree, rich and beautiful language, pointing out the use of outdated words.
  "The language is quite regular with rich words, but there are deviations from the path of our current literary language. For example, he employs such words as "your eyes", "let go", "you", "women", "reached" ... և etc "[14,99].
In the first collection, contemporaries notice and emphasize the painting, the new and the special, which are typical of the newly discovered poet.
 The works and their language are valued in the course of the historical development of Armenian literature, being qualified as a new choreography.
Later, until 1903. The publication of the collection, the reviews published in the press, in literary magazines were full of rather short, sometimes unfounded, often contradictory qualifications.
 1896 In his review of the poem "Loretsi Sako", Leon states that the provinces sometimes "erase the lines written in the authentic literary language".
 Shirvanzade, highly appreciating Tumanyan's language վան style, nevertheless points out the use of dialects, which may be acceptable in prose, but not in verse works.
 "His poems are not obsessive, the melodies are attractive, devoid of uniformity.
  Only he sometimes uses the popular dialect for evil, often resorting to the words that can be whispered in the ear of a deaf person [17,257].
 It is obvious that those who appreciate Tumanyan's talent and the depth of language clarity hint at the use of some dialect words as a defect.
1903 does not escape the attention of contemporaries. The 3rd collection "Poems", which was a new level of fiction in all respects.
 H. Lalayan confesses in the letter he wrote to Tumanyan. "I have always felt that our secular language is beautiful, quite rich ... But I felt that our secular literary, the Armenian language itself hid such treasures in it, which are abundant in your poems, but I was not I saw, now I saw ա I was convinced ”[6,298].
 The letter writer is absolutely convinced that the language of "Nor-Dari", "Mshaki", "Luma", "Murchi" is not Armenian, as it is far from the real, living language spoken by an Armenian, it has no soul.
 The press flooded with strange, incomprehensible, indigestible words, in fact, does not give anything to the Armenian reader.
  "Your talent is a brilliant gem," Lalayan writes, "and your tongue is a golden ring that, as a pleasant frame, strengthens the glow of the gem."
 Language is the bringing of the Albanian poet into language. After all, "the Lord will make the cross powerful" [6,299].
1904 "Mshaki" hm. Speaking about the same 3rd collection of "Poems" in 2, Leon values ​​only Tumanyan's mastery of painting, weaving beautiful songs with colors. "They are external decorations, but in the action of the content, the mountain singer remains one-sided, naive."
 Unlike Leo, Av. Aharonyan, in a large-scale article published in "Murch", among other works, considers the lament of Anush, who is half-mad with grief, to be one of the most valuable artistic parts of the poem "Anush", which stands out in such a "successful arrangement of words that even reading" [15,176].
Aharonyan also refers to the poem "David of Sassoun", proposing the strong idea that the priceless treasures of folk art can become the property of the public only in the case of literary elaboration.
  "P. Turning "David of Sassoon" into a literary language, Tumanyan has rendered a lot of service to the work of popular reading.
Thanks to him, now our only epic song can be understood by every Armenian with pleasure to read ”[15,184].
  It is noticeable that the critique is not focused on the material, but on the literary elaboration and the horse. Aharonyan, refraining from a detailed examination of the poem, evaluates it from another point of view, comparing the versions of "David of Sassoun" with the relevant passages developed by Tumanyan.
 The reviewer proves that Tumanyan, deeply understanding the spirit of the original, remaining faithful to the material, decorates the material with great skill, folk spirit and style.
Unlike Aharonyan, in 1904 The author of another review published in "Taraz" on February 15, S. While appreciating Tumanyan's "vibrant" pen, Mandinyan considers the most beautiful "mine" of the people, "David of Sassoun", to be an unsuccessful development.
 Making petitions with Pushkin, Mandinyan accuses Tumanyan of remaining faithful to the versions of the epic, of "being enslaved".
  It is noticeable that the opinion voiced on the poem lacks comprehensive, in-depth analysis, theoretical and principled substantiation.
Mandinyan pays attention to the work "Aivazovsky's painting", considering it a "poetic invention".
 It seems that the work will be appreciated, but the following lines immediately prove that at the beginning of the XX century the aesthetic perception of the artistic image was not fully established.
 Mandinyan states with conviction that the word "stop" "spoils the thing", ignoring the possibility of a figurative use of the word, gives primitive explanations.
1904 "Luma" magazine publishes G. Yengibaryan's article.
The reviewer notes that the songs "are a sign of an independent attitude to the popular poetry, the language և the style he uses in a talented way" [8,230], and in the case of "David of Sassoun" emphasizes the greatness with which he created the spirit of the historical period, the ideals of the people. views. "... His language is clear, pure, sweet-sounding, rich in the forms and styles of the vernacular" [8,238].
 The simplicity of Tumanyan's style is also noticed by another article writer, Hmayak Hambaryan.
According to the reviewer, the language of the poems is free from eloquence and eloquence, but in the case of poems he states that, like other poets, Tumanyan does not have the powerful and regular language that is the necessary ornament of the poem.
As we noted above, Tumanyan was sometimes accused of using dialect words.
  1910 In the article "Minkatoghutyun" published in "Horizon", M. Ghazaryan considers the use of some dialectal elements ("so", "so") in the "Lusaber" textbook unacceptable and suggests the compilers to replace them with literary words.
 In response to the accusation, Tumanyan presents a number of arguments to justify the use of "this, that, that." He first mentions the psychological reason why those words sound more intimate and sincere.
Then there is the fact that the "this, that" used by millions of people should be considered more acceptable than the "this, that" used by several hundred, even thousands of people.
 "I take my materials and language from the people and talk to them," [2,470], Tumanyan writes.
 Time distance allows us to claim that Tumanyan is really unrivaled in the development of folklore.
  It is not accidental that in 1912 In the review related to "Brave Nazar" N. Aghbalyan, highly appreciating the literary elaboration of the fairy tale, considers it unnecessary to refer to Tumanyan's language, writing: "He is one of the creators of the Armenian language. He is a poet, "from head to toe", like Lear, a king, that is, he creates our national thing, which means word "meaning".
  Aghbalyan's critique indirectly points out that Tumanyan's greatest genius is manifested not only through "what", but also through "how?"
Thus, Tumanyan was absolutely convinced that he was following the natural path of language development.
 "Then try," he says, "they spoke to your children at home in whatever language you write, you will see that it is fake, and you will be disgusted with falsification."
  What is the use of literature that is incomprehensible to its people?
  Oh, we do not write to be taught in libraries ... ”[4,625].
  Tumanyan was of the opinion that the living and powerful source of the language of literature is the word of the living people.
 However, some concerned with language issues suggested a different approach.
 1910 "Luys" weekly publishes A. Meghryan's article "Our Children's Literature և Armenian Language", where the author expresses concern that some of the writers (H. Tumanyan, Av. Isahakyan - AM) use Armenian provincial and foreign words in their writings, thus undermining the purity of the native language.
  Meghryan demands to write only in pure Armenian.
  During the debate, Tumanyan proves that there have always been loans in both literary and popular languages. Life also develops due to external influences, so it is impossible to avoid borrowings meaninglessly.
 Borrowing is one of the ways of language development.
 Language is the basis of human cognition, the main means of communication, so it should be accessible to every member of society.
  From that position, Tumanyan justifies the use of vernacular forms in his works.
Why, the appreciation of Tumanyan's art continued?
  In 1912, P. Makintsyan's large-scale article "Faces" was published in the "Spring" almanac in Moscow.
  From the very beginning, the reviewer points out the line that defines Tumanyan's literary face and art. "Indeed, his style, his modus dicendi, the way he expresses himself - characterizes his literary face.
  Hovh. Tumanyan expresses everything in the way of narration, regardless of what is the material of his work, nature, whether it is a spiritual life or a conversation ... ”[1,249].
 And Tumanyan is able to tell, to open the inner world and feelings of the heroes of nature "thanks to his language, perfect language."
  After carefully studying the poetic works, Makintsyan expresses various, sometimes contradictory opinions, some of which are not examined from a distance, but the writer of the article mainly shows an unchanging position on the language.
 Considering "David of Sassoun" the most successful poem, Makintsyan writes. "Hovh. Tumanyan's heroes speak Armenian, և their language is fluent, the style is subtle, և no intricate comparisons, no dark images. unadorned-native folk language, clear and resounding, like a mountain-speaking tributary ”[1,299-300].
  It is noteworthy that we meet the same comparison in Av. Isahakyan in a small article dedicated to "Gikor". "H. Tumanyan's language is so subtle, at the same time so vivid, like a mountain stream, at the bottom of which the patterned grains of sand shine" [7, 131].
 "Makor" considers "Gikor" an exceptional gem.
"And how much the appearance of the song, the carefree language and style correspond to the content," Makintsyan writes, referring to the last episode, when Hambo, wearing Gikor's clothes, returns to the village.
- No chess-fearful exclamation, without beating the chest, without ah and fear, anger, outwardly calm and simple language, the poet speaks "humorous" and "tragic" moments.
 But it is not a primitive way of composing. not only great grace and educated taste, but also great work is required to attain such perfection ”[1,310-311].
In the study "Tribute to the Past" in the same book, the author, D. Ananun, tries to reveal the peculiarities of Tumanyan's poetic world, considering one of the secrets of the charm of art the power of his speech, the skill that the poet uses to understand the essence and depth of events .
 "In a carefree, simple language, Saro tells his dream to the barley thrower," writes Anonymous.
"Tumanyan presents to your eyes ձեր the soul the images carved with his unblemished pen, leaving you to accept or reject them" [1,125].
Among the opinions voiced about Tumanyan, V. stands out. Teryan's report "The Coming Day of Armenian Literature".
 Highly appreciating Tumanyan as an artist, a wise and sublime translator of the people's soul, Teryan mentions that "he stands on his special path, which is full of artistic wonders, but he will remain as if in one ear ..." / 18,72-73 / .
  This idea of ​​Teryan gave rise to disagreements, the comments were mostly superficial in nature, sometimes they were perceived directly.
  1919 In the article dedicated to Tumanyan's 50th anniversary, H. Surkhatyan, delimiting the poet's place in Armenian literature, rejects this opinion.
 He values ​​not only the thematic-ideological side of the works, by which the young generation is educated, "learns the Armenian language", but also "the artistic language brought to ideal clarity and clarity" [13].
  The impression is that the critic, not noticing the depth of the opinion voiced 5 years ago, denies the idea of ​​the "unicum" theory.
 V. According to Partizuni, the hint refers to Tumanyan's language.
 The fact that the linguistic principles of the two poets contradicted each other is also confirmed by the contemporaries.
 N. Tumanyan tells that in 1916 After Teryan's visit in January, his father said the following: "Vahan is a poet of lyrical mood and mild character.
  He does not use the inexhaustible treasures of the vernacular.
  Minas, you have lived in Akhalkalaki ... speak your country, speak in the language of your people, give it a breath, bring its style ... I am not so sure of anything as I ask about the language.
 This is true - it should be written in the living language of the people so that the people can read and understand something ”[3,140].
 Ed. Jrbashyan gives a remarkable comment to the "unicum" theory, rejecting the one-sided explanation that the provision of Tumanyan's uniqueness leads to the question of only language.
 We see solid evidence of opinion in Part II of the report.
  Speaking about Tumanyan's language, Teryan notes that in the first period Tumanyan created in dialect, but gradually improved, went "to crystallization, preserving from the dialect only what is not in the literary language, that is, standing in a straight line" [18,88].
  Teryan draws parallels with Pushkin. "Today Tumanyan has brought his language to the crystalline clarity that brings him closer to Pushkin, which should be considered one of his supreme merits." [18,89].
 Teryan considers the famous "es" and "en" of the poet unacceptable and expresses hope that they will soon give way to their place.
It is obvious that no matter how much Teryan was against some dialectal figures, he confidently points out the uniqueness of Tumanyan, as a brilliant translator of the soul of the Armenian people, a poet who realizes the national, universal values.
 It is not accidental that in 1919 Among many other articles in the article published in the "Alik" literary collection, the author: Ter-Martirosyan notes that a middle school has been created in Armenian literature, which, of course, can be called Tumanyan.
        Thus, the literary critics of the time generally appreciated the language of Tumanyan's work, the deep sense of folk language and spirit, the skill of using it with high art, but did not fully reveal the irreplaceable role that Tumanyan's language had in the development of artistic language.
 Tumanyan combined the literary language and dialectal forms together, creatively, with a mastery typical of a genius artist, with the conviction that literature is not real literature without a living language. "Language has only one meaning and one meaning - to speak to the heart of the Armenian man, the Armenian people" [2,240].
 The most obvious proof of what has been said is that Tumanyan remains unrivaled among the genius poets of Armenian literature. any topic is presented under the pen so simply, but so deeply, wisely. Its secret is, first of all, its simple language, familiar to everyone's heart.
