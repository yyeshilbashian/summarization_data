The experience of macro-seismic studies of strong earthquakes shows that their quantitative estimates change depending on the energy of the earthquake, the mechanism of the epicenter, the distance from the hypocenter, the direction of seismic fluctuations, relief, resonance conditions, soil conditions, etc.
  Due to the latter, very often there is a sharp difference in deformations, not only in the adjacent structures, but also in different parts of the same structure, which means that it is not right to rely entirely on mathematical methods for calculating the quantitative indicators of seismic impacts.
 The mentioned will be more pronounced if we mean that 1.
Each 1 cm2 of 200,000-scale map has an area of ​​4 km2, with seismic effects of up to 1-2 magnitude at different sites, which means that when assessing the impact of a possible earthquake on an area, it is necessary to take into account other conditions. Take the lithological composition of the rocks that make up the area and their geotechnical properties.
The presented work was carried out in addition to 2016. The first stage of the work carried out by EISI within the framework of the "Improvement of the Yeghvard Irrigation System of the Republic of Armenia" program, during which, as a result of the research, the expected seismic intensity in the reservoir area was determined using different theoretical models and empirical dependencies.
  The works were carried out in the following three main stages: - Construction of a structurally dynamic generalized model of the upper part of the earth in the study area, which served as a basis for the separation of seismic zones.
- Seismotectonic zoning of the area - separation of seismic zones based on the maximum strength of possible earthquakes in them.
- Area zoning according to the degree of seismic hazard.
Yeghvard Reservoir is located in the central part of the Republic of Armenia, not far from the city of Yeghvard.
 The area around the reservoir (around the reservoir with a radius of 50 km) is distinguished by a rather complex geological structure, which includes rocks of various heights, from the Precambrian to the Quaternary.
  The ancient rocks are represented here by the formation of the Baikal complex, the most complete section of which is exposed within the Tsaghkunyatsantiklinorium [1].
From a tectonic point of view, this region has a rather complex structure, including sections of several sub-zones of the Bazum-Zangezur Intensely Wrinkled երձ Merdaraxian Moderately Wrinkled Zones: Hankavan-Zangezur, Yerjan-Ordubad, and the Mesopotamian Mesopotamian Depressions.
Taking into account the complexity of the tectonic structure of the study area, as well as the existing disagreements about the latter, the method of complex interpretation of the results of deep geophysical (gravitational-seismic) surveys was chosen as the main means to identify the elements of the deep structure [2, 3, 4].
  Based on the results of three-dimensional quantitative interpretation of attractive data, the structural model of the earth in the study area was constructed for three averaged depth levels [2, 4] .1. On the surface of the crystal base (up to 5 km) 2. Seismically active floor area (up to 20 km) 3. At the Mokhorovichich border (up to 45 km), the selection of these depths is based on deep seismic sensing data obtained by the Neftegeophysics Research and Production Association in 1989. [5]
According to these data, the earth's surface will also have a layered structure. The seismic horizons dividing it are placed at levels corresponding to the above depths and change depending on the local geological structure.
The seismic model of the earthquake in the area of ​​Yeghvardikon, located near the Yeghvard reservoir, has the following appearance.
As can be seen from Table 1, the observed site is generally elevated, where the crystal base ceiling is located at a depth of 2.0 km, characterized by seismic wave propagation velocities of 5.2-5.4 km / s, and the depth of the seismically active layer floor is 19 km, where The index of layer speeds reaches 6.2-6.4km / s.
Table 1. Capacities of the earth layers in the adjacent areas of Yeghvard Reservoir արագ Seismic wave propagation velocities Layer ceiling Strength of the layer (km) (km) Layer velocity V-P (km / s) Fracture tectonics maps for two depth levels (5 և 20 km).
   Within the boundaries of the study area, the crystalline base of the earth is distinguished by a geological, structural-tectonic inhomogeneous structure.
  The depth of the latter varies from +2 km to -6 km above sea level, in some places even in the Aparan-Arzakan section a crystalline base is exposed, where it is represented by pre-Cambrian Paleozoic metamorphic rocks with sheets, gneisses, etc. .
 The greatest depths of the surface are observed in the Aragatsilern massif, where they are up to -6 km from the sea surface.
Within 20 km of the area under study, which is accepted by us as the depth of the floor surface of a seismically active layer, it is divided into regional zones of relatively elevated relative elevation (Fig. 1).
The isolated regional zones have the following parameters: I. Aragats-Geghama lowering zone, consisting of two fragments of Aragats և Geghama-lowered, with a depth of 24 km և 30 km and dimensions of 25 × 80 km, respectively.
II. Yerevan-Yeghegis ascent zone, consisting of two fragments of Yerevan և Yeghegis Elevated, at a depth of 13 km և 15 km, respectively, with a total size of 30 × 80 km.
III. Near-Araks landing zone, which is presented as a single fragment within the studied area, with a depth of 25 km և 10 × 60 km.
IV. Aragats-Hrazdan uplift zone, consisting of Aragats և Hrazdan raised fragments, respectively 13 km և 15 km deep սահման within the study area with a total size of 10 × 60 km.
V. The lowering zone of Dilijan, which was a small area of ​​the south-east in the study area, has a depth of 25 km և 10 × 40 km.
The mentioned regional zones and the fragments forming their parts are separated from each other by deep fractures, which are mainly in the north-western distribution, and two of them, Aragats-Javakhk-Garni fractures, have the northern-north-north-western distribution respectively [4, 6].
One of the most important tectonic elements of the area studied from the seismotectonic point of view is the Pambak-Sang deep fracture (indicated by 1 in the map), which appears on the earth's surface at depths up to the crystalline base with a complex of fractures of various nature. -20 km.
 In the deeper horizons, they condense and turn into a single fissure zone.
 The nature of modern tectonic movements is the same everywhere with these faults, with a right-angled northeast.
An important role for the assessment of the seismotectonic potential of the region is also played by the complex of contours of the Yerevan-Yeghegis uplift zone (in map 2), which are the northern-southern components of the known Yerevan deep fault (in the map 2 'և 2' ').
The northern border rupture is pursued in the direction of Ashtarak-Garni, it separates the Aragats-Geghama lowering zone from the Yer-Yeganis elevation zone.
  The fracture north of Garni village intersects with the Garni fracture և undergoes a displacement with an amplitude of up to 10 km.

 The southern component within the study area, in the Yervandashat-Masis section, has a near-transverse distribution, and north of Artashat it bends to the south-east, follows in the direction of Vedi Elp, merges with the Garni rupture.
 The next possible deep fault to assess the seismotectonic potential of the study area is the above-mentioned Garni fault (Map 3), which has a north-northwestern distribution and is characterized by high tectonic activity.
  This rupture was found in A. Ս. Karakhanyan on the basis of aerocosmic, structural-geological ախ other materials [7].
 The modern activity of Garni rupture is evidenced by the bends of Hrazdan և Azat rivers at the places of intersection, in the first of which only during the Holocene-Pleistocene period there was a right turn of up to 100 amplitudes.
 At deeper horizons, the speed of rotation is tens of times faster than on the surface.
  According to the results of high-precision instrument measurements, the break-up length is 2 mm / year.
Thus, as a result of three-dimensional modeling of the gravitational field և analysis of deep seismic sensing data, a map of the fault structure was made, which was used as a basis for comparison with seismological data, seismotectonic zoning, seismic banding, using various theoretical models.
  As a result of averaging the data obtained from these calculations, the expected initial seismic hazard on the territory of Yeghvard Reservoir was estimated for PGA = 0.33g average (II class) ground conditions, which, according to MSK-64 scale, is equal to 9 points intensity.
In order to obtain more realistic assessments of the expected seismic hazard, the latter was differentiated according to the geotechnical properties of the rocks forming the area, for which A. served as a basis. T. Edited by Aslanyan in 1986. published 1.
200,000-scale engineering geological map.
 According to that map, there are twelve different geological-lithological complexes in Armenia, which are divided into four categories according to rock stability: strong, medium, weak, very weak.
Fig.2. Detailed seismic zoning map of Yeghvard Reservoir արդ adjacent areas (taking into account the stability of geological-lithological complexes) The engineering-geological structure of the area adjacent to Yeghvard Reservoir with a radius of 50 km includes all lithological complexes with the mentioned stability (Fig. 2), with almost 70% of the area being strong. , and the remaining 30% falls on rocks with weak to very low stability.
The average index of stability is mainly volcanic rocks, which are represented by tuffs, tuff breccias, tuff sandstones, sandstones, limestones, marls, argillites, quartzites, porphyrites, pyroclasts, etc.
 With their mining-technical properties, these rocks correspond to the rocky-semi-rocky soils, therefore, with their seismic properties, they coincide with the middle soils, which can be attributed to the initial seismic intensity, which, depending on the potential focal point of the sites. .
The volcanic formations of Enmiocene-Pliocene և Quaternary, which are represented by basalts, andesite-basalts, andesites and dacites, stand out with strong stability in the study area.
  They are mainly spread in the regions of Aragats, Ara Geghama և Geghama effusive volcanism.
  These rocks with seismic properties correspond to the first-class soils, therefore the initial seismic intensity in their distribution areas is reduced by 1 point, it is estimated at 8 points.
The rocks with low stability are represented by Miocene-Pliocene volcanic-sedimentary rocks: clays, sandstones, pumice sands, tuff sandstones, sand-mixed clays, pebbles.
The seismic properties of these rocks correspond to the indicators of the third class soils, therefore the expected seismic intensity in the areas of their distribution should be increased by 1 point, equal to 9-10 points.
Areas whose ground conditions with seismic characteristics correspond to Category IV soils have been isolated in the study area.
  They are mainly represented by quaternary deluvial-proluvial, alluvial-proluvial, alluvial-lake formations - sands, clays, clays, stones with very weak stability.
  Some parts of the Yeghvard Reservoir area are represented by such soils, which means that it is necessary to show a special approach here, that is, in addition to increasing the initial seismic intensity by 1 point, to plan additional engineering works on the construction site, landslides, etc.
Thus, the work done showed that the study of the deep structure of the region և the separation of possible focal zones is of primary importance in solving the problems of detailed seismic zoning.
  In order to assess the seismic potential expected from these zones, it is necessary to show a comprehensive approach, using not only seismic-paleoseismo-geological data, but also all possible theoretical-empirical connections.
The seismically isolated areas should reflect as completely as possible the natural state that has a real impact on the seismic impact level, therefore the MSM should be carried out on a conditional engineering-geological basis.
