Preface. The flora of Armenia is rich and unique,
However, many areas have not yet been fully explored.
 Our research relates to one of those areas whose flora is being studiedfor the first time.
The upstream of the Chichkhan River was selected as the study materialThe flora of the surrounding alpine-alpine zones.
The diversity of flowering plants was mainly studiedin which special attention was paid to the endangered և RA Red Bookidentification and description of registered species.
The urgency of such research is also conditioned by that. "State programs for the development of various sectors of the economy, in particular tourism (ecotourism).
Material դը method. Used in research work
is the method of scientific inventory.
 They were studied using this methodThe diversity of plant species growing in the Chichkhan Valley և their distribution among different disciplinary groupsև.
 Plant species have been collected, herbariums have been prepared.
 Plant species have been identified using the scientific literature.
 Armenian-Latin names of plants are given according to R. Ւ. Ghazaryan, 1981 [2].
The study area is located at an altitude of about 2500 meters above sea level in the alpine-near-alpine zone.
  It is a deep river valley with an asymmetrical structure.
 The right bank of the valleyis a significant slope of the northeastern position(15-200), steep slopes in some places, as a result of which they are quite wetare և well vegetated.
 In some places on the shores of Ajapn are preserved poplarssmall formations of populus tremula, which:In our opinion, they are remnants of a disassembled range.
 It can be assumed that:The causes of disintegration are anthropogenic.
 Existed in the pastWe do not have clear information about the formations we have.
  It is believed that aspen forests occupied Shirak until the 18th century.Almost the entire northern slope of the mountain range from Akhuryan gorge toThe mouth of the Chichkhan river.
 This view is supported by the post-forest lands preserved on the mountain slopes, as well as some toponyms.analysis [4].
Unlike the left bank slope of the river valley, the left bank slope is longerIt is gently sloping, has a south-western position, due to which itis drier, weakly fragmented.
  Xerothermal formations are predominant here, in which rare plant species have been preserved.
Conducted by us for field researchroute extraction.
  The total length of the first route was:7 km.
  It includes the Bashgyugh-Getik reservoir section.
  GPSMAP 76:(versatile navigaton) device 1.
Based on a 50,000 scale mapRare գտնվող registered in the Red BookPlant sites, as a result of which a large-scale geological map has been compiled.
 Extraction was carried out by the same method on 3 routes: (Kakavagyugh - Dzorashen - Trchkan waterfall (5 km), Trchkan waterfall -Upstream of Trchkan river (5 km), Trchkan waterfall - Shirakamut (8 km)).
The results of the research. As a result of the research, 31 families belonging to the study area were described
about 135 plant species.
 Such a large variety of plants is typical of alpine-alpine zones.
  Such a variety of floradue to the unique geographical location of Armenia,by climatic, geological factors.

  Among them are the five-limbed lion (Leonorus cardiaca L.), the bitter wormwood (Artemisia absinthium L.), creepingThyme (Thymus serpyllum L.), porous hypericum (Hypericum perforatum L.),big, lanceolate, small ox tongues (Plantago major L., Plantago lanceolataL., Plantago minor L.), sandy loam (Helichrysum pintocalix D. Sons.),fragrant chamomile (Matricaria discoideae DC.), high-scented (Verbascumthapsiforme Schrap.), alpine sage (Cephalaria alpina L.) և etc.
7 plant species registered in the RA Red Book were also found in the area [3].
 The vegetation of the latter begins in March-April, when the grazing of the animals has not started yet.
 This allows these plants to finish pollination և to ensure normal growth.
 It is necessaryNote that most of these 7 species listed in the Red Book are growingin rocky, rocky areas where the animals are mostlyThey do not graze.
  In our opinion, the preservation of the diversity of flora also contributes to the sown areas in the mentioned areareduction.
The names and categories of plant species registered in the RA Red Book are given in Table 2.

  That aspen forest existeduntil the ice age of the Quaternary [4].
 The forest spreads on the banks of Tichkan waterfall և Chichkhan river.
 There are fragments of forest nearby Near the villages of Dzorashen, Sarapat, Bashgyugh, north of the mountainson the slopes.
 Among the shrubs found in the forest are the common gerbil (Viburnum lantata L.), the rosacea (Roza canina L.).integerrinus Medik.), common forget (Rubus idaeus L.) և etc.
 To the latter:Most of it is at the edge of the forest.
Some of these forests are located quite far from residential areas, which allows for more or less normal growth.
 The forests are relict nature.
During our research we also examined the artificial pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) planted in the spring of 1977.the forest.
 Pine forest is located on the right bank of Chichkhan river, near Salut, Bashgyugh, Pokr Sariar, Kakavasar, Sarapat ար Dzorashen villagesareas.
 Both the river and the surrounding area of ​​the forest are quite rich in flora.
 Ordinary forget-me-not, red currant (Ribes) are found on the upper edge of the ordinary pine forest.rubrum L.), full-bodied birch, rosemary, common evergreen shrubs, common spruce (Sorbus aucuparia L.) և summer oak (Quercusrobur L.) a small number of trees.
 In some parts artificial pinesAccompanied by small aspen islands.
 They meet in the area. "Artificially grown willow trees (Salicaceae) that spread along the river.
 Occurs willow fern (Salix fragilis L.), goat(Salix caprea L.) և etc.
          These shrubs manage to finish during the summer their vegetation.
 They meet approximately at noon. At an altitude of 2300-2500 m.
 It should be noted that there is a relatively slow annual growth of "pine, oak" and "aroseni".
 Conditions are favorable for increasing the number of young trees, as the grazing of livestock in these areas is insignificant, which allows young trees to be harmless.to grow.
It should be noted that in order to ensure the growth of the forest to a large extentcontributes to the strict control of deforestation by the forestry of the area.
The grass cover of the forest is mainly represented by buckthorns, field lizards, teluks, mosses, etc.
 In the vicinity of the forest it can be found with complex flowers, lilies, umbrellas, carnations, roses, etc. Great diversity of families.
Conclusion. Based on the results of field studies, as well as literature analysis
to claim that the Chichkhan River valley is distinguished by great biodiversity.
The natural landscapes of the river valley can be divided into two groups.relatively wet (left slopes of the river valley) և dry (right of the river valley)slopes).
  In general, the natural vegetation is well preserved,only in relatively low-slope areas, itSignificantly altered or transformed agricultural lands.
Such a high rate of biodiversity is an opportunityprovides for the development of ecotourism in the middle stream of Chichkhan.
Suggestion. Due to the unique microclimatic conditions of the study area, the Chichkhan valley is significantly different from the rest of the Ashotsk region, so it is necessary
to carry out additional plant geographical research, which will be a good precondition for the development of recreational resources.
 SimilarAfter research, the area can be turned into a sanctuary:solving a local environmental problem.
