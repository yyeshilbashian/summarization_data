At the present stage of language development, the enrichment of the word structure is mostly done at the expense of verbs connected with word-և suffix patterns.
  According to A. According to Sukiasyan, word complexity is one of the most important ways of enriching the word structure of a language (8, p. 292), and the compound compounds composed of the grammatical component occupy a large place in the Armenian կազմում vocabulary են the vocabulary is enriched with morphs and adjectives.
In the present article we present the methods of composing compounds based on verbs, the types of bases, their different forms, morphological patterns, the syntactic-syntactic relations of the components, and many other questions related to the verbal bases.
  The study shows that most of the bases participating in the word formation of modern Armenian have passed from the Old Armenian աբար serves to compose new words.
  The temporal component of the composition of complications is more common as a constituent basis.
 It is explained by the fact that the preferred component of the original or real complexity is the second component, and the first component is its complement.
The facts show that compound words with predominant verb components are not particularly productive in composing nouns, as most compound words with such a structure express a significant relationship.
 Below we present the morphological patterns of the parts of the speech, in the composition of which verbal components participate.
C + B, A + B, M + B templates are the most viable among the phonological templates of verb bases.
 1. New words created as a result of combining the components of the C + B template can be "nouns", "adjectives".
  Here the main meaning of complexity is expressed by the verb, and the noun component, with different meanings and relations, complements it.
"Inside the complexity," writes S. Eloyan, - the components composed of nouns and adverbs (verb bases) have semantic relations such as the verb or the footnote with its additions and the subject ”(4, p. 333).
Noun complications are formed with this template, both with articulation: astrologer, dentist, poet, cupbearer, lecturer, bookseller, earthquake, tax collector, taxpayer, newsletter, etc., as well as without joints: instructor, sparkler, egg, host, fisherman, listener, etc.
The parts of the word are denoted by the following letter ‵ c (noun), a (adjective), b (verb), m (maccabee), and the article is marked with a + sign.
By the way, more adjectives are formed with this template.
 The predominance of the latter is explained by the general features of the action expressed by the bayarmat: nationalist, persecuted, dictator, florist, disciplined, bribe-taker, passenger, honorable, heartbroken, seedless, etc.
2. In modern Armenian, A + B is mainly composed of adjectives: vain, long-lived, light-slip, short, quiet, raw, wholesale, delicate, noradavan, sparse, sweet-smelling, etc.
 There are also nouns: intercessor, loudspeaker, relative, antique dealer, liar, helicopter, etc., which can be used as adjectives at the same time.
3. Adjectives are obtained exclusively with the M + B template, as the structure contains a characteristic meaning: abundant, fast-flowing, fast-running, rapid-flowing, sudden, perpetual, perpetual, perpetual, premature, premature, ascending, etc., but there are progressive-consonants. , telescope, telephone, telemetry և etc.
The dates, pronouns, conjunctions, conjunctions + verb components are noteworthy.
  As prof. S. Galstyan, "the last two groups of words, as meaningless parts of the word, do not form subordinate phrases, therefore they do not participate in the composition of real complexities as components (7, p. 23), and pronouns participate little in word formation; in the structure of real complexity they appear only as The first components (1, p. 251).
4. From the point of view of word formation, the self-name is very viable, for example, self-sufficient, self-physician, spontaneous, self-sufficient, airplane, dumped, autogenous, gravity, self-respecting, self-loving, etc.
  It is clear that the pronoun itself does not express the meaning of the third person, but the action performed by the second component itself, such as plane = (flying by itself), gravity = (flowing by itself) Jail.
According to H. According to Barseghyan's dictionary, the number of suffixes of such formations is about 650 (5), which are either adjectives or nouns.
In terms of lexical expressions, the pronoun itself does not differ much from the pronoun, which, however, is no longer viable in the modern word formation.
Ed. In Aghayan's "Explanatory Dictionary of Modern Armenian" he met 9 examples with his + verb-based template, all of which are adjectives: unique, unique, unique, unique, unique, unique, unique, unique, unique, unique (3, p. 1043).
Compositions with other pronouns (whole, all, all, all) are inferior to the above-mentioned, or here the adjectives D + B are mainly derived from adjectives: heretic, alien, alien, pervert, SUV, most pledge, all-gifted, all-built, all-built, all-good, all-wise, burnt offering և etc.
5. The first component in T + B formations is all the dates. Complications from one to nine years prevail, for example, three-weave, three-row, five-lover, one-minded, one-voice, one-voice, one-born, etc.
In terms of their quantitative expressions, they are significantly inferior to the templates in which the verb base is a preferred component.
Thus: 1. The B + C template is mainly used to form nouns, which, when converted to a word combination, take on the sexual connotation of the indefinite article, for example, passport, desk, observatory, starting point, straitjacket, election campaign, style of play, ballroom, competition, exam period, transfer fee, etc. There are very few complications with template A, it is only adjectives.
 Compositions with -and ('s) derivative components are predominant, or are there adjectives on other grounds: receptive, respectable, combative, mobile, defensive, sighted, etc.?
 There are nouns: unemployed, coefficient, competitor, etc.
As for the template of derivative descending basis + constituent basis, it should be noted that in modern Armenian the indefinite, the subjunctive և the participle participate in the composition of compound words with this structure, regardless of the derivations, which are parts of nominal speech.
 The generative basis of these formations has the frequency of usage - write, - act, - speak, - think, - sit, - drive, - eat, with which the constituent base is often -dz, -mater, - style, - place, - pain և Other bases: writing և, writing paper, writing style, period of work, speech, speech և, spoke, thought, way of thinking, sitting և, sitting fee, seat, story writing, story style, fuel, behavior և etc.
From the above examples, it is obvious that the indefinite article, having the meaning of a sexual consonant, is expressed in the nouns, if the constituent basis is a noun (writing-writing, arable-land), sometimes with the meaning of a verb, becoming a problematic addition, if the constituent basis is a verb. (walk-loving - walk-loving, talk-loving - talk-loving, power-loving - rule-loving) և etc. (6, p. 103).
And the subjunctive derby has a dual use in word-formation templates: A. as a basis for original or real complexity, for example, ritual, father-in-law, parent-lover, parent-killer, parent-worshiper, etc. as a basis for the original or real complexity. Moreover, the words of this template can be divided into two groups: words that arise from word combinations: TV viewer, radio listener, radio lover, movie viewer, offender, journalist, և words that arise from the indefinite article: manufacturer, producer, designer, typist, accuser, typewriter, researcher և etc.
 As can be seen from the examples, the bases expressed in the subjunctive verb have a nominal meaning.
The subjunctive has two uses, like the subjunctive verb, the ending of which is the suffix -ts, which forms many vowels from verbs with both an action-related feature and a past participle meaning (2, p. 194).
 For example, bifurcated, overburdened, overburdened, interested.
It should be noted that if the verb component is based on the derivative basis of the verb սեր, the derivative basis is followed by various typological variants (2, p. 251), which can be distinguished: 1. composed of a pure verb, which coincides with the present tense of simple verbs. - pious, orator, aggressor, earth-builder, stone-thrower Gyllen, 2. cloudy, semi-constructed, rewarding, clever, son-in-law, pointing, self-teaching, etc., coinciding with the causal verbs of Old Armenian. Coinciding with the past participles of the past perfect: ethnographic, self-forgetful, flour-milling, knowledgeable, far-sighted, instructive, delicate, etc.4. the types of bases that coincide with the unique second face of the original imperative.
 Lay the foundations are more practical: shoulder, mason, legislator, natural, self-surrendering, etc.
Often in the case of word formation or suffixes, when the verb component is the basis of the complexity, the phonetic changes occur in the verb bases.
 For example, i> is a machine gunner, archer is an archer, i is zero blood relative, companion is a companion, bee is a beekeeper, diver is a diver, and e is a corpse-crematorium, philologist - philology, and> is - fragrant - benevolence, hay - hay, and> v ‵ information-information, dairy-milking և etc.
Finally, when the compound component of a complexity is expressed by a verb or a verb, when translating such complexities into word combinations, the first component acquires different syllabic meanings. Direct-Armenian meaning: flour mill, disciplined, taxpayer, desperate, heartbroken, heartbroken, homeless, reckless, exhausted։ etc.
Sexual - tragic meaning: genuine sexual - princely, masculine, tragic - underground, centrist, celestial, adult, etc.
With exceptional significance: windy, voiceless, heartbroken, mountainous, terrestrial, thoughtless, incapacitated, etc.
By practical significance: asphalt, asphalt, armored, clay plaster, fog, carpet, typewriter, flower decoration, gilded, etc.
In the meaning of Nergoyan: wine-drinker, castle-dweller, mind-sinker, mountain dweller, ash-dweller, darkness-dweller, etc.
Along with the semantic diversity of the Holomմանn paradigm, the components of complexity on a verbal basis are distinguished by a variety of syntactic relations.
The study shows that in modern Armenian quite complex nouns (partly with parts of other words) + verb-based compound words + when expressing a syntactic connection express problem-case relations.
Multiple meaning groups can be distinguished in problematic relations. Complications, the first components of which are food names or items: wine seller, butcher, ticket seller, woodcutter, etc.
b. Complications, the first components of which are the names of various animals: cattle breeder, cow, cow, beekeeper, silkworm breeder, etc.
c. Complications, the first components of which are the names of celestial bodies: cloud, arc, moon, astronaut, etc.
d. Complications, the first components of which are concepts related to different fields of art: duduk player, songwriter, theater lover, pianist, songwriter, songwriter, actor, etc.
It is noticeable that in the list of the above-mentioned complications a significant number are the words expressing a orthogonal relationship, for example: truck, verb, grammar, biography, murderer, carnivore, schedule, cartridge, etc.
Complications related to the problem of the ending, the means, the disconnection express the features of objects, persons ում They mainly form adjectives. some of them have become nouns.
The noun component of the sowing base in complexity expresses: • The meaning of the tragic consonant (rhyme problem): nationalist, thunderbolt, celestial's, heavenly, patriotic, monastic, etc., • Exclusive consonant meaning (separation problem): mineless, seatless, thunderstorm, earthly, dismissed, landless, displaced, heartbroken The meaning of the practical roller coaster (the problem of the means): garbage, forest, salt, asphalt, carpet, ornament, tile, fog, typewriter, illustrated, fence, love, etc.
In causal relationships, the causal relationship is distinguished by the abundance of features related to a person's mental and intellectual activity, for example, the local casual relationship with the frequency of embarrassment, fear, affection, grief, use. The meanings of the latter can be expressed in different ways, for example: Plaintiff: astronaut, skyscraper, sailor, etc. since most of the original or real complications of this structure have passed from the adjectives to the system of nouns: autumn sower, night owl, nocturnal, evening guard, premature, etc.
Complications expressing a problematic relationship can take the suffix -utyun և, according to the noun form of the suffix, to turn into nouns, but the syntactic relationship of its components does not change: murderer-murder, silviculturist-dismissal, dismissal-dismissal, print-printing, deportation-voice, deportation, voice և etc.
It should be noted that in many cases it is quite difficult to determine the syntactic relationships of complexities, և they are often determined in relative terms, given the more acceptable բարդThe most typical syntactic relationship of complexity.
Thus, summarizing the results of the study of word-formation patterns of compounds based on verbs, it can be stated that verb bases have quite flexible word-formation possibilities, նոր new nouns and adjectives formed with them greatly enrich the word structure of the Armenian language.
