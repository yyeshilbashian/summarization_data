Within the framework of the article, a combination of scientific literature, periodicals and memoirs of contemporaries will be the subject of a separate study of the 19th century. The life and activity of the most mysterious figure of the ARF structure in Alexandropol, Avetis Gharibyan (Padvali Vagho).
 A legend of the revolutionary underground, who bypassed the tsarist punitive machine, organized and carried out the "cleansing" of the state arsenals of Alexandropol three times.
Preface.
 Next to the traditional centers of the liberation struggle in the XIX century. In the early 90s, a new hearth appeared in the person of Alexandropol, which, due to its favorable geographical location and the Russian state arsenals located here, gained special significance in the 19th century. late և XX century. in the beginning of the liberation struggle.
 In a short period of time, the city became a gathering place for the armed forces and fighting groups passing to the Earth.
 1890 The structure called "Kar" was founded here in the summer until the XX century. The beginning remained among the most viable and active ARF groups operating in Yerevan province, and its founding members (Tados Khzmalyan, Avetik Maloyan, Alexander Petrosyan (Peto), Enovk Gyunjyan, Vagharshak Zhamakochyan, Avetis Gharibagh (Abodali) left in the history of the Armenian liberation war [8, pp. 37-39].
From the first day of its activity, the structure became a base for the accumulation and delivery of weapons for the organization of the liberation of the Earth.
 Usul Grigory (Durgaryan), Vram Nalchajyan, Phaetonist Varos, Atrents Tigran (Stepanyan), Sogyut (Sarnaghbyur) priest Ter Mesrop Badoyan, landlord Tano Nersisyan, Ghonakhghrantz (Shirak) Dozens of military and armed groups crossed the country.
The ARF Dashnaktsutyun from Alexandropol achieved especially great success in "emptying" the Russian state arsenals.
 "The friends there increased their audacity and self-sacrifice to an unimaginable extent," recalls Sargis Ohanjanyan (Farhat), a well-known ARF Dashnaktsutyun figure. »[18, p. 53].
Under the total control of the Tsarist police under the efforts of Padvali Vagho, Usta Gabriel (Gabriel Zhamharyan), Usul Grigor, Vahan Jallatyan and others, the repeated "cleansing" of the Alexandropolyberd arsenals from 1894
The first group of the ARF in Alexandropol included quite strong-willed and active individuals consisting of intellectuals, craftsmen and small traders.
 Avetis (Avo) Gharibyan, also known as Padwali Vagho (1866-1904), the incomparable master of procuring weapons and ammunition, has a special place among those devotees.
 He is one of the most mysterious ARF figures of all time in Alexandropol.
  A man who, bypassing the tsarist punitive machine for 14 years in a row, was engaged in procuring weapons, ammunition, regularly organizing and carrying out the "cleaning" of the state arsenals of Alexandropol.
Avo was a well-known innkeeper in the general public.
"He was not an intellectual, but he was a very modest, honest and devoted person. from the eyes of the police, "R. wrote. Syan in "Hayrenik" magazine [15, pp. 117-118].
The catering facility called Padwal, which did not stand out with its white tablecloths, vases, or snacks, was merely a semi-basement, with "several black tables without crowds and shelves lined with shelves, a few barrels of wine and beer." p. 213], but he made a great name both in Gyumri and outside Gyumri.
  To reach Gyumri չ not to enter "Padval" meant to see nothing of the contemporaries [14, pp. 211-212].
Another person was the ARF underground figure Vagho.
 Instead of the local costume, he wore a military uniform with no shoulders, handsome, cheerful, generous, polite, and at the same time a highly secretive, mysterious young man whose identity, according to Ruben, was known only to special members of the Central Committee.
Despite his personal acquaintance, Ruben became acquainted with some episodes of Vagho's revolutionary activity only thanks to Sergei [1, p. 3] 4 and Hagop [11, p. 232] 5 after Vagho had already died in the battle of Zardanis [12, p. 111].
 And even in this case, he received confirmation that he "did not hide his knowledge if he did not want to put his head in trouble" [14, p. 213].
For ordinary party members, Vagho was a mythical person who was able to supply as many weapons and ammunition as they could hide.
 It was a secret at what price and in what way it was done.
Ruben got acquainted with Vagho in 1904. in the spring in "Padval".
It was here that he saw for the first time another underground legend, Bidza (Harutyun) from Swaziland, who was talked about as a "soaped rope" to strangle traitors.
 "When I heard the name Bidza, I shivered," recalls Ruben. "Bidza seemed to me like a snake, from which there is no escape, even though he was a handsome man and there was nothing monstrous about him" [14, p. 215].
If Vagho's job was to obtain weapons, then Bidza's duty was to hide what he had acquired.
 And since both were known for their extreme silence and secrecy, rumors were circulating in Alexandropol that "Bidzan, who suspected that he had a weak mouth against arrogance, would cut the neck of the soap in Vagho Padual and cut his neck and cut it." »[13, p. 83].
It is noteworthy that an experienced ARF member like Ruben believed in that news for a long time, and years later he confessed in his memoirs. "If I also tell you that I fully know the essence of the matter, do not listen" [14, p. 212].
4 Sargis (Sergey) Harutyun Hovhannisyan-the same Aram Manukyan. He was born on March 19, 1879 in the village of Zeyva, Ghapan, now Davit Bek.
  According to another point of view, in Shushi.
Well-known state and public figure, governor of Van, dictator of Yerevan, Minister of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Armenia.
 He died in 1919. was born on January 19 in Yerevan.
5 Hakob Chilingaryan (Ashot Haykuni) - former officer of the Russian army, graduated from Etchmiadzin Gorgian Seminary, one of the key figures of the ARF Kars Jraberd structure, from 1903 he headed the formation of groups passing through the country, in 1904 Participate in the "cleansing" operation of the Alexandropol state armory.
  He died in Vladikavkaz prison in 1912. at the beginning.
Vagho started his revolutionary activity in the early 1890s, arming Grigor, Vram Nalchajyan and Atrents Tigran from private individuals to meet the needs of the country.
 However, this method of procuring ammunition did not justify itself.
First, it was impossible to get a large quantity of weapons at once in this way. Then the pistols and rifles were bought at a rather high price, used and very often repaired several times.
 He also justified the tactic of seizing weapons from Russian soldiers guarding state institutions.
 After one or two successful incidents, the police simply doubled their forces [9, pp. 147-148].
 And finally, a constant danger of being revealed by karma.
By the way, the convenient opportunity for the Alexandropol gendarmerie department to take revenge on Vagho was not late.
  1891 At the beginning of February, when the local ARF structure was going to send the first military unit to Van [8, pp. 37-38], its Greek neighbor A. Abramov's betrayal արդյունքում as a result of a search carried out in his own tavern, Vaghonkankets stood before the undeniable accusations confirmed by material evidence և.
 A search of Padwal on March 6 turned up a bag with 229 Berdanka rifles and 128 factory-made Sneijder rifles.
  During the search, lists of names written in Armenian were found ությամբ Address letters with the content of receiving weapons and ammunition from Vagho.
Given the existence of such a base of material evidence, it seems that Vagho should not have had the opportunity to avoid punishment.
  However, the retaliatory steps taken by the people of Gyumri with special ingenuity, which simply astonish their logic, turned the trial around, turning the defendant into a victim of slander, and the defendant into a criminal who had falsely betrayed.
On March 14, defendant A. Gharibyan, based on the testimonies of Harutyunyan, Nalbandyants and Tanyants, residents of Alexandropol, gives a written statement that the bag with the found bullets was thrown into a tavern. By Abramov, and "1888. The list of names entitled "April 16, money collected for the sacrifice" is just the list of participants in the fundraiser organized before the Easter holidays.
 According to the witnesses in the case, the Armenians have a habit of making donations on the eve of Easter.
 The bull bought on the day of the holiday is grilled and distributed to the poor along with bread and wine.
  That is to say, part of the names in the found document belong to the participants of the fundraiser, and the other part belongs to those who made the expenses.
 On the same day, witnesses in the case, Mkrtich Khalatyants and Madat Zatikyants, told the investigating mother Arshak Charchoghlyan that the real reason for Gharibyan and Abramov's enmity was to take the second buyers from the first, so that they could regularly hear how Abramov had threatened to meet with Abramov.
This fascinating work came to an end after 1892. On February 19, a manuscript examination proved (probably not without the help of Vagho's relatives) that the unsigned letters found in Gharibyan's tavern were written by Chukharyants, a former student of the city college. By the compulsion of Abramov.
Based on these newly discovered facts, A. The criminal prosecution against Gharibyan was stopped.
1892 By letter No. 1707 sent to the Yerevan State Gendarmerie Department on September 7, 2007, Lieutenant General Shebeko, Chief of the Police Department, was forced to inform that "Alexandropol resident Avetis Gharibov (aka Gharibyan A.H.) was indicted on charges of state crime." with the consent of the ministers, it was terminated for further investigation, canceling the measure of persecution applied to the accused ”[3, pp. 188-197] 6.
In fact, thanks to the ingenuity of his entourage, Vagho managed to thwart the investigation of the justice system of an entire empire.
6 "City accused of state crime. The photocopy of the report on the case of Alexandropol resident Avetis Gharibov was brought to Armenia from the State Archives of the Russian Federation. Khudinyan in 1988.
1892 Recently, arms purchases have resumed.
 However, as we have mentioned, this method of procuring ammunition did not justify itself.
  It was impossible to meet the growing needs of the liberation movement through procurement.
  Tomorrow he was against the way of buying ammunition from private individuals.
  "A drop will not be enough," he repeated, "to find another way" [14, p. 216].
And that way was found. 1893 Recently, the idea of ​​looting the state arsenals of Alexandropol came to fruition.
 The program was developed by members of the ARF structure in Alexandropol: teachers Avetik Maloyan, Tados Khzmalyan, painters Gabriel Zhamharyan, Alexander Kupalyan, and jeweler Ghor Halachyan.
 It was decided to take out a large number of bullets from one of the arsenals in the "Polygons" district of the city.
"Cleaning" was to be done by Vagho, blacksmith Vram Nalchajyan, Martik from Ghonakhghran, student Grigor Faytonchi Varos.
 The security of the group was to be provided by Aramayis Aznavuryan, Atrents Tigran ոռ KorEghon, accompanied by three soldiers of the arsenal guard.
 For the implementation of the program, the ARF local structure allocated the necessary amount of money - two four-wheeled trucks (vans).
"The spirit of practical work and the solver of difficult problems was Padwali Vagho," recalls A. "Aznavourian, a simple and modest man, who was surprisingly secretive, knew how to keep his thoughts to himself."
Due to his follow-up work, he managed to find out by bribing a Russian officer named Margar, a Russian officer, which military unit controls which armory, and in which part of the arsenal what weapons are.
 "We owe it to Padwali Vagho's hard work and diligence that the soldiers and officers who later served in the Alexandropol army did not spare us the necessary support, but also played an active role in the difficult task of removing ammunition from the arsenals, endangering their lives." [9, p. 148].
 The two-day "cleansing" of the arsenal took place at the end of August 1894.
  With the help of Russian soldiers, 200 boxes (60,000 pieces) of ammunition were transported to Jonakhgran by the trucks of the fighter and phaeton Varos.
The most responsible moment in this action, according to A. According to Aznavuryan, the doors of the warehouse were sealed with wax. "The two ends of the thread passed through the locks are sealed with wax and fastened to the door of the door.
 That candle was slowly torn off with a sharp knife, then the ends of the threads were torn from the candle, the locks were opened with pre-made keys and then the candle was attached to the thread in the same way and the doors were opened with a pre-made seal ”[9, p. 150].
There was so much ammunition that the ARF Alexandropol Committee decided to build two new arsenals.
  The first of these was built in the basement of the house of Master Martiros in the village of Daharli.
 The second warehouse was built outside Alexandropol, under the shop of the blacksmith Georgi Chakhmakhyan, with the efforts of Usul Grigor, Vram, and the painter Gabriel աղ Vagho.
 In order to hide the traces of construction, the excavated soil was taken out in sacks, the flowing river was filled, and the walls and floor of the excavated basement were fixed with cement mortar [9, p. 151].
In the days of the Hamidian massacres, when the issue of transporting ammunition to the country became urgent [16, pp. 59, 2, p. 217], it was decided to repeat the operation of "cleansing" the state arsenals of Alexandropol.
  This time Padwali Vagho was in charge of the case.
 With the support of the painter Gabriel, finding supporters among the Armenian soldiers and officers of the Russian military base, they agreed to remove bullets from the arsenals.
 At the end of 1896, Vagho, Martik from Ghonakhghran, teacher Tados, A. Aznavourian, Moruk Karo (moved to Alexandropol in late 1896) and painter Gabriel moved from various arsenals to the villages of Daharli, Jonakhghran and Bayandur for a week and stored 4-5 Berdanka rifle cartridges per day (52,000 pages, 17, 500, 17). ].
 "The case was so well organized that the military authorities did not know anything," wrote A. Aznavourian in his memoirs [10, p. 138].
Sasun 1904 On the eve of the self-defense, when the transportation of ammunition to the country again became an urgent issue, the ARF structure in Alexandropol revived the tradition of emptying the local state arsenals.
  The third, last creator of "Cleaning" was completely planned by Vagho.
Establishing close ties with one of the officers of the military unit controlling the arsenal, Vagho persuaded him to support the case of unnoticed looting of the warehouses for 20,000 rubles.
  He managed to get involved in the case - 5-6 of the most trusted Armenians serving in the military unit, who "were thirsty to go to" Yerkir "" [14, p. 216].
The two main characters of this adventurous program were Bidza from Vaghav-Swazi.
 By the way, Bidza should not have known with whom, how to enter Vagho warehouse, and Vagho should not have known, with whom, how, where Bidza was going to keep that huge stock of ammunition.
The main operation was performed in three stages. 1. Vagho "decorated" the arsenal only with the help of two well-known friends and Armenian soldiers of the military unit.
2. The removal of the traces and the transportation of the theft was organized by Kars with 10 friends and four trucks.
 The ammunition taken out of the warehouse was transported in two trucks (twice a day) to Ghizilchakhchakh village of Karsimarz.
 Immediately after the wagons left, the smell of sheep under the walls of the arsenal erased the traces.
3. The acceptance and storage of ammunition was organized by Hakob Chilingaryan from Gyumri.
  After Bidza left, Hagop's group (Usul Khecho, Haji Lon, Ashik, Saro from A. Aznavourian) from Mizel, who had reached Gizilchakhchakh, divided the ammunition into pieces and placed it in the local ARF arsenals [13, p. 83].
Due to such a division of labor, the people of Gyumri did not know how many weapons were stored in which village of Kars region, and the people of Kars thought that the weapons had been stolen from the military train from Tula [13, p. 81].
During the next month, this series of actions was repeated 13 times.
  Tomorrow the group managed to get 437 (Berdanka) rifle (50,389 pieces), 30 (30,000 pieces) "Pipot" type rifles and 46 cartridges of "Smith իս Wisson" pistol (66240 pieces) from Alexandropol arsenals.
  As well as 30,115 different types of bullets with their capsules (cartridges) [4, pp. 4, 5, p. 2].
 "He only forgot the bag he had brought with Vagho, with his tools, and the empty beer can…," Ruben wrote in his memoirs [14, pp. 222-223].
However, the withdrawal of this huge stock of ammunition went unnoticed.
 A Russian soldier named Bushkov in 1904. On January 7, at 9 o'clock in the evening, returning to the fortress of Alexandropol, he noticed "10-15 Armenians with handcarts on the snow and something eaten on the ground" [4, p. 4].
 He immediately informed the non-commissioned officer Shamakhyants about what he saw.
  However, the latter reported the matter to his superior Sheremet only a week later, on January 13.
 As a result of the immediate investigation, it turns out that the theft took place on January 7, between 7 and 9 o'clock, during the regular Margaryants duty (the latter had already disappeared by the time the theft was discovered).
 Within the framework of the same criminal case, it turns out that one case of robbery of an arsenal took place in 1904. on January 5.
 One of the Georgian soldiers of the guard, surnamed Kutashvili, noticed 8 people carrying suspicious goods near the "Akhaltskheyan" gates of the Alexandropol fortress on the evening of January 5.
 After finishing their work, 5 of them left the field, and three returned to the fortress.
 Two of those who returned to the fortress through the efforts of Kutashvili և's other soldiers, Grigor Ghazaryan և Harutyun Melikyan, were arrested.
 At 8 o'clock, Kutashvili reported about it to NCO Baghramyan, an Armenian, but the latter did not proceed with the case.
A few days after the initiation of a criminal case against the non-commissioned officer Shamakhyants on January 13, rumors about the January 5 incident, the suspicious behavior of non-commissioned officer Baghramyan and the arrest of two Armenian soldiers reached the Russian command.
  1904 On January 23, 1945, by the order of Colonel Smirnitsky, the arsenal No. 131 of Alexandropol Fortress was opened.
 The investigation revealed that the theft was committed on January 5, between 7 and 9 o'clock, from the warehouse window, during the duty of private Shahbazyan [4, pp. 4, 5, p. 2].
In the framework of the criminal case initiated on the basis of the obtained evidence, the military court in 1904 On June 24, he sentenced non-commissioned officers Martiros Baghramyan and Nikoghayos Shamakhyants to 6 to 5 years in prison, respectively.
  Private Harutyun Melikyan, Grigor Ghazaryan and Arshak Shahbazyan stood before the military court.
  The first two of them were acquitted by the court and released, and Arshak Shahbazyan was sentenced to 6 years of hard labor [4, p. 4].
Alexandropol was immediately surrounded by troops, and searches and arrests began.
  According to "Droshak" periodical, Acting Prime Minister of the Caucasus Civilian General Frese arrived in Alexandropol from Tbilissi (Georgia) to monitor the situation.
 Within a few days, 400 people were arrested in the city of Kars alone, and 50-60 people were deported [6, p. 29].
However, these events were late.
 The real organizers and perpetrators of the crime had long since left the borders of Alexandropol province.
 The officer of the military unit controlling the ammunition was transferred to the service in the inner states of Russia with a change of position.
Bidza from Swaziland and Suren and Grish, Armenian soldiers who directly participated in the "cleansing", had disappeared from Alexandropol.
  Arriving in Salmast months later, Ruben met Nikol Duman (Nikoghayos Ter-Hovhannisyan) in the group of two soldiers of the Tsarist army from Akhalkalaki, about whom they "whispered that they were Vagho people and the heroes of Gyumri, but they refused to be" [ , p. 221].
Vagho was not the direct initiator of the case.
 As a member of Torgom (TumanTumyants) "Vorskan" group, he died in Zardanisikr in 1904. in July.
 While crossing from Olti to Narima, the group came under fire from Russian "Turkish border guards".
  Some members of the group were killed during the skirmish, and the captives were killed by the Russians on the orders of the Tatar colonel Bikov in the presence of the Turks [7, pp. 60-61].
The tragic end of tomorrow was an irreversible loss for the liberation movement, it caused great pain to the friends.
 A. Aznavuryan recalls that "despite the insistence of the Alexandropol authorities and friends to stay and continue his responsible work," with a simple smile on his face, he answered: "Enough, brother, as much as I can give weapons to others and send them to die.
 Now the love (my turn - AH) has reached me "[9, p. 141].
Conclusion.
  Summing up the brief examination of the revolutionary activity of Avetis Gharibyan (Avo, Padvali Vagho), one of the most mysterious figures of the ARF Dashnaktsutyun structure in Alexandropol, let us mention the following. The life of this unique master of weapons and ammunition can remind many of the plot of an adventure movie.
 The imperative to act in the revolutionary underground forced A. To combine Gharibyan with courage and ingenuity, but that did not diminish the self-sacrificing self.
 Bypassing all the traps set by the tsarist regime, he engaged in the procurement, repair and delivery of weapons for fourteen years in a row, personally or with friends organized and carried out the looting of the state arsenal of Alexandropol.
Such was the real daily life of the revolutionary struggle, where the tsarist administration and the long-standing aspiration for the liberation of the homeland clashed.
