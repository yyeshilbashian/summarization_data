The best of the equivalent quantities of different mineral-organic fertilizers is compost 22.0 t / ha norm, from the application of which in the conditions of Ararat valley a high-quality tomato crop of 629.0 c / ha is obtained, 2958.5 thousand. Additional profit of AMD / ha, which is offered to be invested in agricultural production.
Introduction.
  In general, in agriculture, the agro-measure is now a great test; it is widely used whenever it is economically efficient, every dram spent provides a certain profit, otherwise the given measure is not rooted in production.
According to Yu .A. According to Gusarova, the compensation for each ruble is 3.5 rubles for mineral fertilizers and 3.0 rubles for organic fertilizers.
F. Baynokh [1], Mine և others [3] և M. H. Galstyan [4] notes that although high doses of phosphorus-potassium in the crops of agricultural crops grown in irrigated areas (corn, autumn wheat, potatoes, alfalfa, eggplant, etc.) provide economically low yields of fertilizers, but high fertilizer application.
Fertility Analyzing the results of many years of field vegetation experiments, the authors note that the expenditure on nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium per kg of active substance provides an average of 7-12 kg of grain, 18-35 kg of potatoes, 19-34 kg of sugar beet, 20-38 kg. tomato additives [2,3,4,5].
 Expenditures on the use of one ton of biohumus և 5 tons of semi-decomposed manure provide additional production of 1280 և 980 kg of potatoes, 400-500 kg of grain և 1350-1500 kg of tomatoes, respectively.
 Done Material և methods.
The aim of the research was to find out the effect of adequate quantities of mineral և organic fertilizers on the quantity of tomato crop և economic efficiency համ to compare the obtained results with the data on the equivalent quantities of mineral fertilizers used in the region և
In calculating the economic efficiency of the mentioned agro-measures (adequate quantities of manure, manure, biohumus և compost) , manure purchase, compost purchase, application վաճառ selling prices of tomatoes.
քներըResults and analysis.
  According to the results of vegetation experiments, in case of application of adequate amounts of different mineral-organic fertilizers, the tomato crop fluctuated at the average of three years, 379-629 c / ha or increased by 99-349 c / ha or by 35.4-125.0% compared to the control.
  The maximum yield increase was recorded in case of application of 22.0 t / ha of eco-compost (Table 1).
In case of application of equivalent amounts of manure, biohumus and compost with differentiated mineral fertilizers, the crop increase (in three years) was 111-250 c / ha or 29.3-65.0% [6].
Effect of Equivalent Quantities of Different Mineral-Organic Fertilizers on Tomato Yield Table 1. Experimental Yields Yield, average 3 c / ha 1. Test 3. Manure 25 t / ha + P604. Biohumus 8 t / ha 5. Compost 22 t / ha Additional crop / ha Economic efficiency calculations have shown that the equivalent quantities of different mineral-organic fertilizers everywhere, without composting, have provided high yields not only in terms of yield but also in terms of total cost-effectiveness.

Received a strainer benefit, provided an additional crop of 99.0 c / hapidomor compared to the controller of the norm of mineral fertilizers (N120P120K120) with full results of vegetation experiments performed during 2017-2019 per ounce. per hectare received only 816.5 thousand.
The picture is different when analyzing the economic efficiency calculations obtained using the appropriate amounts of different organic fertilizers, making comparisons with և without fertilizer, և with the full ratio of mineral fertilizers accepted and applied.
It was found out that if the norm of 25 t / ha of manure together with P60 together provided 1571.5 thousand drams of additional profit per hectare, the standard of biohumus 8 t / ha of 1981.5 thousand drams was obtained from the application of 22.0 t / ha of compost. 2958, additional profit of 5 thousand drams.
  It is noteworthy that as a result of the application of organic mineral fertilizers, the highest amount was provided by the compost norm of 22.0 t / ha, in which case an additional profit of 5.6 drams was received for each dram spent.
Equivalent to equivalent yieldConclusion.
  Thus, the best norm of mineral-organic fertilizers is 22.0 t / ha of compost, the application of which results in 629.0 c / ha of high-quality tomato crop in the Ararat Valley, 2958.5 thousand. Additional profit of AMD դիմաց for every AMD spent - additional profit of 5.6 AMD, which is offered to be invested in agricultural production.
