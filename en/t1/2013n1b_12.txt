"Right" totalitarianism is based on the ideology of National Socialism, preferring the National-Racist.
Although the Soviet model of totalitarianism has failed in the USSR and in a number of Eastern European countries, the issue of scientific coverage of this issue is becoming more and more urgent in the modern conditions of democratic development.
Totalitarianism, as a political system, is manifested through the European system.
The political regime, created by the interaction of the structural elements of the social-political system, is a set of unique means, methods and ways through which the ruling political elite exercises purposeful state power, relying not only on institutional mechanisms, but also on solutions outside legal standards.
There are now more than a hundred political regimes in the world, which are similar in many ways.
65 out of 165 sovereign states in the world have democratic regimes and 50 have semi-democratic regimes [1].
There are different approaches to the classification of political regime in the political science literature.
  R. Dali և J. Blondel typology stands out among the various classifications of political regimes [2].
R. Dal uses two main criteria. The degree of admissibility of the opposition to the political process հրապարակ public competition for power.
J. Blondel divides political regimes into 3 groups: • political competition - open or closed, • elite structure - monolithic or stratified, • degree of population involvement in political life.
When classifying regimes, political scientists base themselves on the following criteria: the rights and freedoms of citizens, nations and nationalities, the existence of party systems, political opposition, the level of separation of functions of state bodies, the political culture of the people, etc.
The ratio of democratic to non-democratic political forces stands out among all these criteria.
  Political scientist I. Balyan, based on the level of development of society's democracy, classifies modern political regimes (in a broad sense) as democratic (presidential-parliamentary), non-democratic (totalitarian-authoritarian), or simply totalitarian, authoritarian-democratic [3].
We agree with the author that this classification is considered conditional, as it contains general, transient և hybrids.
 There are mixed regimes in the world that closely combine elements of totalitarianism, authoritarianism and democracy.
 The Franco regime in Spain is an example of a unique mixture of totalitarianism and authoritarianism.
Totalitarianism entered the political literature in the 20th century, when society entered the industrial stage of development.
  The term "totalitarian" was first introduced into politics in 1925. to the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, who expressed its meaning as follows: "Everything is in the state, there is nothing outside of it, so no one can oppose the state." [4]
According to historian I. Petersen, the concepts of "totalitarian" և "totalitarian system" were first introduced in 1923. Italian liberals introduced Giovanni Amendolan և Piero Hobbetti into the political vocabulary.
  And the first political scientist to use that concept was the German K. Schmidt in the 30s of the 20th century.
1929 This concept was published in the "Times" newspaper, referring to the Soviet political regime.
  In the USSR, the term "totalitarianism" was coined in the post-war period, mainly to condemn the blatant dictatorship of Hitler's Germany and Nazi Germany, the backward bourgeois state.
The scientific coverage of totalitarianism began in the 4050s of the 20th century and continued into the following decades.
  It was widely discussed for its ideological struggle against the socialist countries in the East.
The totalitarian regime flourished only at the beginning of the 20th century, which was the result of the crisis of the ideas of classical liberalism և mass socialist movements.
  The main feature of this regime was that the "builder", the social pillar, in contrast to the previous regimes, was considered a broad mass of people, which in the new ownership relations became a socially alienated object, that is, an individual deprived of property, independence and self.
The social pillar of "left" totalitarianism was the lower classes, first of all the multinational proletariat, which was fighting against its own owners.
The tough, powerful administration promoted not the national but the class interest; it identified the individual with the state and the society.
Class unity ignored the conflicting interests of different ethnic groups.
The social basis of "right" totalitarianism was the extreme mood of the middle class.
  German Nazism received support from large capital.
  The ideology of National Socialism was called to unite the German ethnos, ignoring social conflicts, identifying society as "nation, nation" as state.
 The country had a large politicized working class, and a large part of the peasantry ran a large agrarian economy.
 A middle class of small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and craftsmen was formed.
According to the dictionary of political science (VF Khalipov, RG Grigoryan, AV Grishin, VS Ovchinnikov, etc.), totalitarianism is considered a political regime, a system of state power, which is characterized by direct governance of society, political violence. Pluralism (Latin: Pluralism - pluralism), lack of democratic freedoms, restriction of political rights of the entire population.
Totalitarianism is a political regime in which the state seeks complete, inclusive control over society as a whole.
The above definitions are typical of all types of totalitarian regimes.
Within the framework of totalitarianism, a number of authors (R. Kochesokov, M. Vasilik, etc.) distinguish between fascist, Bolshevik, and Nazi regimes.
  The countries of the totalitarian regime include Nazi, Nazi Germany, Italy, the USSR, China, Albania, Cambodia and other countries.
The totalitarian regime, as an alternative to civil society regimes, existed in Nazi Germany in 1933. until 1945, in the USSR in 1922. until 1991, in Albania - E. During the Khoja era, in North Korea after World War II, in Vietnam Վ Cambodia in 1975. then.
If the "right" totalitarianism is characterized by a nationalist ideology, the "left" is characterized by a socialist-communist version.
Political scientists distinguish between religious totalitarianism, which is permeated by theological presuppositions.
The ideology of totalitarianism is usually guided by non-democratic political forces, so it is rejected by the civilized world.
A totalitarian regime cannot be equated with a dictatorial regime, as it is a unique form of coercion of state control that is acceptable to the majority of the population.
The dictator himself chooses the apparatus of public control, tries not to allow the participation of the masses in the government.
In totalitarian societies, there are "illusory" levers of control, which are considered not an elite apparatus, but an instrument that fulfills the will of the people themselves.
  People think that they decide the means of pressure, coercion, the values ​​of the society գործ's orientations.
The mechanisms of exercising political power in totalitarian-dictatorial regimes are radically different.
If in dictatorial regimes the state opposes the individual, the latter is an object of political power, then in a totalitarian system the individual identifies with the state, finds it difficult to distinguish his "I" from the general "we", acts as a "subject of political power" .
Of course, the identification of a person և state is's feminine.
 Such a political system has been called by Western politicians "a dictatorship of the mass movement."
The characteristic feature of totalitarianism is the absolute violence of the subjective factor towards the objective reality.
The second important feature of totalitarianism is the molding of social consciousness, ideological monism (one, only).
 The Stalinist version of totalitarianism is a modified Marxism, which was the ideological basis for the party-state totalitarian regime.
  The theoretical basis of totalitarianism can be any idea: class (communism), national or racial (fascism), religious (communism), etc.
  Communist ideas Values ​​do not in themselves give birth to a totalitarian regime, as some claim.
  If they become self-serving, reprehensible, they inevitably give birth to totalitarianism.
Nazi Germany persecuted those with communist views, but totalitarianism was established there.
The Khomeini people are not only religious fanatics, but also unique bearers of totalitarianism.
It was typical for all totalitarian countries to have faith in the "savior", the "ideal monarch" who gave eternal happiness to the people.
One of the most important features of a totalitarian regime is the extreme politicization and ideology of the whole social life.
The next characteristic of totalitarianism is material, especially careful self-isolation.
 Soviet society, especially during the Stalin years, was deprived of the opportunity to have economic and cultural ties with foreigners, to communicate and compare with them, to listen critically to the opinion of others.
 Indifference to objective reality is a result of the violence of the subjective factor.
The leaders of totalitarianism believe that the key to building a new society is to create a new person who is self-sufficient by changing social relations.
A totalitarian regime ends the division of society into conflicting social strata, condemning all members to "leveling".
  Nevertheless, the official ideology of the Soviet country, drumming up the ever-increasing number of the working class, its productive activity, declared it a "leading", "leading force of society."
The other factor in the institutionalization of the "left" totalitarianism was the laureates of the Stalinist state awards, well-known figures in art, literature and science, who received constant support from the political elite.
The relations between the society and the "individual" become one-sided, everything for the society, nothing for the individual, because the individual was identified with the society.
Elsewhere in the USSR, the totalitarian regime brutally persecuted the clergy.
 The "death of God" was necessary in order not to limit his one-sided influence on the thoughts and souls of the masses.
Organized, large-scale uprisings, political movements, riots, and demonstrations were ruled out in Soviet society.
 The people did not alienate the leaders from them, they did not see them as exploiters.
  The person completely lost his individual dignity, became a defenseless, powerless, submissive being before the powerful state authorities.
 A system was created to restrict people's initiative, depriving talented people of the opportunity to excel.
  In the country, disobedient people were considered "dissidents" or "enemies of the people" with tragic consequences.
During the totalitarian regime, the ideological point of view of classical works is proposed.
Works that did not comply with the "policy" of the totalitarian regime were banned from publication.
  Censorship was spread on those mass media that did not support the state-party policy.
There were petrifications and distorted assessments of political phenomena in the ideology, as well as the mythological orientation aimed at building a new society.
In the Soviet system, the elections were very formal, there was no competition, no alternative candidates.
 Various mass political movements, rallies, demonstrations, hunger strikes, etc. were prohibited.
  There was no unique mechanism for lobbying or other pressure groups to influence government structures.
  The lobbying movement has been legalized in some countries (USA, Germany, etc.) or allowed with some reservations, considered as an important component of a democratic political system.
In the economic sphere, private and individual activities were prohibited, the economic stimulus of work was ignored, and administrative levers were used.
The country had a "closed" culture, which was characterized by political inclusion.
 Innocent people and racial-ethnic groups were terrorized during the dictatorship.
The propaganda distorted and colored the reality.
  And the USSR Constitution was a cover for the existing contradictions of its declared "real life" ideals.
The totalitarian regime of Stalin Brezhnev violated the anti-national doctrine of the Soviet nations, the freedoms and rights of the nations, the non-radical interests of the peoples were ignored, the borders of the republics were forcibly deported, arbitrarily drawn, the process of nationalization was promoted.
Abuse of official duties and corruption have become commonplace among leaders.
 However, during the totalitarian regime, the society suffered the biggest loss in the moral sphere.
  Finally, a totalitarian type is formed, who not only does not like freedom or does not want freedom, but is afraid that he cannot use it.
  Such a person is very beneficial for the political leaders in the period of origin, establishment and strengthening of the totalitarian regime.
  Such people hinder the social progress of the society, lead to stagnation.
 Meanwhile, thinking, creative, self-acting individuals are necessary for the development of the society, and only free people can be such.
Totalitarianism differs from other regimes in the degree of control.
No dictatorial regime, except the totalitarian one, establishes a unified official ideology in the society, does not seek to control the whole activity of the society.
Thus, the main features of the former Soviet totalitarianism are: over-centralization of the party-state bureaucracy, hierarchical apparatus, worship of a charismatic leader, mythological orientation monologue, censorship of the media, persecution of dissidents, violence against citizens, civil rights , implementation of anti-national doctrine, formation of a new person who prefers "us", exclusion of an alternative candidate during the elections, interference in church affairs, joint state planning of the economy, prohibition of private "individual activities", existence of mutual morality in the society. "We say one thing, but we do another."
Based on the facts, it is obvious that the collapse of the Soviet totalitarian regime was inevitable, it was transient, of course, it was not eternal.
In the USSR, "left" totalitarianism, which is characteristically characteristic, was established in the will of the people.
characterized by main features.
 unlimited strength of national leader monodialogy, one partycollective mechanism of governing.
