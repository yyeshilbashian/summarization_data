The aim of the presented article is to analyze the recreational potential of the relief of the Javakhk plateau within the borders of the Republic of Armenia for the development of different types of tourism and recreation.
Geomorphological recreational resources are a combination of horsepower.
 Moreover, all the elements of the relief can have different history, origin and development history.
 At the same time, geomorphological recreational resources can have scientific, medical-biological-aesthetic value, which is a good precondition for the development of recreation, particularly tourism.
For full use of geomorphological recreational resources, they must have certain features. be attractive, affordable, well-researched.
  They have high excursion features, diverse landscapes and stand out with their stability [4].
Another feature of geomorphological resources is their presence everywhere (relief is available everywhere).
 Given this circumstance, it can be said that the recreational use of geomorphological resources can not be restricted.
  It can be used as a recreational resource if it is technologically viable.
The results of the research.
 The plateau of Javakhk spreads in the north of the republic, occupying an area of ​​480 km.
  From north to south within the borders of the Republic of Armenia, the maximum length in the direction of Legli-Karakhach mountain pass reaches 19 km.
 From west to east the width of the plateau in the direction of Sizavet-Szaberd (Caracalla) is 25 km.
The plateau is a young volcanic eruption that eventually formed in the late Middle Ages.
The volcanic activity here has created dome-like structures, which are mainly composed of andesitic lavas.
 In general, the Javakhk plateau stands out in the territory of the Republic of Armenia with its mild relief, which is favorable for hiking routes.
 One of the main features is the relatively flat relief of the watershed, where several dome-like peaks rise (Legli 3156, Achkasar 3196, Gharanakh 3038, etc.).
 These peaks are not inaccessible և can be a destination for hiking trails.
The glacier reliefs preserved on the plateau can be an object of tourist interest.
  As a result of glacial activity, glacial circuses were formed on the top of the plateau.
 They are especially well expressed in the northern regions, in the upper reaches of the river valleys opening to the west (Chakkalget, Sarigyugh) and east (Arkajur, Sjaberd).
  The valley of Sjaberd river, which extends to the eastern slope of the plateau (12 km), can be especially interesting for tourists.

 Similar valleys extend into the upper reaches of the river valleys on the western slopes of the plateau.
The rivers starting from the Javakhk plateau in the middle streams flow mainly through the valleys developed by glaciers, with trogons.
 The latter are well preserved, especially on the eastern slopes of the plateau (S'aberd, Arkajur, etc.).
In general, the Javakhk plateau is characterized by an abundance of flattened horses, which is due to the extraction activity of glaciers.
  The top, partly western slopes of the plateau are covered with eruption surfaces, and the glacially cultivated Qatari zone is better preserved in the north.
In the highest part of the plateau, which is located on the Armenian-Georgian state border, in addition to the glacial relief, hanging valleys have formed, which descend sharply to the main river.
 Typical hanging valleys extend upstream of the Chakhkal-Achkadzor rivers.
In order to evaluate the recreational possibilities of the relief of the Javakhk plateau, as an element of the relief assessment, we calculated two main morphometric indicators of the relief: the slope slope խոր the depth of division.
 The position of the slopes can be used as an evaluation indicator, but the limited volume of the article does not allow to include the mentioned indicator in the evaluation.
For the recreational assessment of the morphometric indicators of the relief, we have compiled a special table, where the qualitative-point assessment of the relief indicators is given.
The evaluation system presented in the table refers to four types of recreation, the development of which is more realistic in the Javakhk mountain range.
 The study area has favorable climatic conditions for alpine skiing.
  The snow cover up to 2000 m altitude is 140 days, which ensures the economic efficiency of the recreational complex [7].
The altitudes up to 2500 m, which occupy the edge parts of the plateau, are more favorable for skiing.
  These heights cover 223.0 km ², which is 46.4% of the total area of ​​the elevator.
  Comparing the map of hypsometric zones with the map of the depth of fragmentation, it becomes obvious that the most favorable indicators of the depth of fragmentation with the favorable height are on the slopes of the east-south-east position of the Javakhk plateau, where the density of fragmentation reaches 250-280 m.
The third indicator of relief assessment, the slope of the slopes for the mentioned heights, has the following picture. The slopes of the east-south-east slopes spread in the range of 18-30 °, which is assessed as relatively favorable.
 Achkadzor և The slopes in the S'aberd river valleys are 25-33 °, which is unfavorable for alpine skiing (see Table 1).
 The slope index is more favorable for the western-south-western slopes, where the slopes are up to 18 °.
The combination of the three indicators shows that the relief of the Javakhk plateau at an altitude of 2500 m is favorable for the development of alpine skiing.
Favorable indices of deep relief (100-250 m) predominate on the western slopes of the plateau, where the slopes are favorable from 1 ° to և 6 °.
Weak slopes are typical of the ահ Ashotsk concave contact zone of the plateau, which is a low-slope valley covered with lake և fluvioglacial sediments.
In addition to resting winter horses, the Javakhk plateau has favorable conditions for organizing summer recreation.
 For hiking (regular) routes, taking into account the depth index (300-500 m), the eastern slopes are more favorable.
Among the peaks of Dalidagh (3046), Karanakh, Chomcha (2804) the index of fragmentation fluctuates in the range of 300-350 m, which is the best for the organization of this type of rest.
  The slope index (5-15 °) becomes more favorable up to 2200 m.
 These slopes predominate on the western slopes.
The relief of the Javakhk plateau provides an opportunity to organize a walking rest.
 Walking is more expedient in the lowlands, up to 2500 m, which, as already mentioned above, occupies 46.4% of the plateau.
 The site of Karakhach mountain pass (2273 m) stands out, which is located in the south of the plateau.
  The slopes spread here are weakly divided. The depth of the split is 80-150 m, which is the best indicator for ebony rest.
The slope of the slopes in the area of ​​the mountain pass itself is 3-5 °, and on the south-western slopes in the Zuygaghbyur-Hartashen section - 4-8 °, which is also favorable for pedestrian routes.
Conclusions.
  Based on the performed researches, three morphometric indicators of relief were compared.
 According to that, it became obvious that: a) Almost half of the territory of Javakhk plateau (46.4%) is at favorable altitudes for recreation (up to 2500 m).
b) The morphometric indicators of the plateau relief are favorable for the organization of rest for both winter and summer holidays.
c) The eastern slopes of the plateau are more favorable for the organization of skiing (regular) և other forms of recreation.
 For non-regular recreation it is expedient to use the south-south-south-weakly fragmented, slightly sloping slopes.
