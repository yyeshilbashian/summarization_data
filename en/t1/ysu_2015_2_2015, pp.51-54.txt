ABOUT THE CURRENT SITUATION OF THE RA ENERGY Energy, except for electricity, develops mainly through the import of fuel raw materials (natural gas) and nuclear raw materials.
  The reserves of low-quality coal (gray) found in insignificant quantities in the territory of the Republic of Armenia have no industrial significance.
 Among the mines are Germanis (Ararat region), Jajur (Akhuryan region), Dilijan, Ijjan mines.
 During the energy crisis in 1995, 25,000 mines were mined at the Jajur mine. t gray coal [2, p. 118].
 The Geological Survey has registered 60 peat deposits, 16 of which are explored.
 There are peat deposits in Lori region, in Tashir, Stepanavan, Gugark regions, in Gegharkunik region, in Vardenis region.
  Peat reserves are estimated at more than 21 million m3.
  Since the 1920s. Large quantities of oil products, coal, and later natural gas were imported from abroad, in particular, oil from Azerbaijan, Russia, coal from Russia, Ukraine, and natural gas, first from Azerbaijan, Iran, and then from Russia and Turkmenistan.
  Natural gas entered Armenia in 1960.
  Armenia Gas currently imports from Russia and Iran.
  Gas imported from Iran is consumed by the Hrazdan TPP, the electricity produced by which is exported from Iran to Iran.
  The capacity of the gas pipeline allows Armenia to consume an average of 8-9 billion m3 of gas per year, but now it is consumed 4 times less in our republic.
 This is explained by the fact that in the Soviet years the main consumers of natural gas were industrial, particularly chemical enterprises such as Nairit և Vanadzor Chemical Combine.
  And now the main consumer population of natural gas is the road gas stations.
 One of the important achievements of newly independent Armenia in the energy complex is the construction of the Iran-Armenia Pipeline, which is an alternative to the 1960 Russia-Armenia gas pipeline built.
  For years, the Iranian authorities have been negotiating the construction of an oil pipeline from Iran to Armenia, which will push Iranian oil to Armenia, which will allow the construction of an oil refinery, on the basis of which it will be possible to develop petrochemicals.
 Not only Russia is against this program, but also Azerbaijan, Turkey and the European Union, because Russia does not want Armenia to gain independence in the energy sphere, to have one more competitor in the region.
  Turkey and Azerbaijan are also interested in the economic weakening of Armenia, and the EU imposes economic sanctions on Iran.
  According to the RA Minister of Energy A. According to Movsisyan, if successful, the construction of the oil pipeline will take two years, which will require $ 100 million.
 Iran plans to export about 15 thousand drams a day to Armenia through a pipeline. t gasoline և diesel fuel, the annual demand of RA oil products is about 400 thousand. tons.
Natural gas has a large share in the total volume of energy consumption in Armenia - about 50%.
  Armenia receives all its natural gas from Russia, which has the largest volumes of natural gas in the world և controls 80% of Armenia's energy network.
  The monopoly on the import and distribution of natural gas in Armenia belongs to ArmRosGazprom (now Gazprom Armenia).
  The Hrazdan thermal power plant, which supplies about 24% of Armenia's electricity demand, uses natural gas, making Armenia energy dependent on Russia.
  Moreover, natural gas is the main means of winter heating of the country.
  In 2007, Gazprom provided 2 billion m3 of natural gas to Armenia.
  As a transit country, Armenia has reimbursed Georgia about 10% of the total for Armenia.
  Russian natural gas is supplied to Georgia և Armenia through two main pipelines: North Caucasus-Transcaucasia (1,200 mm diameter) և Mozdok-Tbilissi gas pipeline (700 mm diameter).
 2008 Armenia imported 2.2 billion m3 of gas from Russia [1].
Gr. 1. The annual amount of ArmRosGazprom per 1 m 3 The new gas pipeline of the Iran-Armenia natural gas pipeline was built in 2008. in October.
  It was privatized and operated by Gazprom Armenia.
 The gas pipeline connects Armenia to neighboring Iran, which is the second largest gas producer in the world after Russia.
 It has a capacity of pumping 2.3-2.5 billion m3 of Iranian gas per year.
  Although Iran is ready to supply gas to Armenia, the RA Minister of Energy in 2008 In October, he announced that there was no need for Iranian gas yet!
  Analysts claim that Armenia's resistance to Iranian gas imports is the result of pressure from Russia, which maintains its monopoly in the Armenian natural gas market.
  Gazprom owns the gas pipeline network supplying domestic consumers in Armenia.
  In addition, Gazprom owns a crucial part of the pipeline.
Having no oil reserves, Armenia imports oil products from different countries of the world, in particular, from Eastern Europe, Russia and Iran.
 Various lubricating oils are imported from Turkey.
 In recent years, the consumption of gasoline 0501001502002502005200820092010 has sharply decreased due to the increase in prices, և second, cars are mainly filled with gas, which is cheaper.
Despite the lack of fossil fuels, Armenia has significant domestic resources for electricity production.
 1960s All electricity was generated at hydropower plants, and in 1981 ․ The latter accounts for 14%.
 1978 The electricity balance had the following structure: Produced: 11498 million kWh, Received from abroad - 106 million kWh, Consumed on the spot - 7822-8862 million kWh, Loss in the network - 1049-1060 million kWh, Reported out: 964-1682 million kWh.
Statistics show that in the past, Armenia not only met its domestic needs, but also had the opportunity to provide a significant amount of electricity, 15% of its production, to the Transcaucasian energy system.
 2012 year. The balance is: Produced: 8036․2 million kWh, Imported from abroad: 98․1 million kWh, Spent on the spot: 6438․2 million kWh, Loss in the network: 981․4 million kWh, Exported is 1696-1 million kWh.
2006 Non-thermal domestic electricity production accounted for 76% of the total electricity generated, including nuclear power - 43% and hydropower - 33%.
 2002 Those numbers were as follows: 56%, 32% և 26%.
In terms of alternative energy production, it is now planned to build a geothermal power plant in Syunik.
 2008 Only one wind power plant (in Lori region) has been operating since
  RA Ի IRI jointly designs an Iranian-Armenian power plant, which will become the largest wind power plant in Armenia.
  The rest of the electricity is produced by burning natural gas in Yerevan և Hrazdan thermal power plants.

The EU energy program has four main directions: improving energy security, convergence (unification) of energy market member states based on the principles of the EU internal energy market, promoting sustainable energy development, and attracting investment for common regional energy projects.
At the same time, the entire energy system of our republic is under the control of Russia, a strategic ally, which is an obstacle for the successful implementation of this European program.
