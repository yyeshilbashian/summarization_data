The radical changes taking place in the society themselves force to carry out purposeful reforms in the education system, to develop strategic programs for the training of future specialists, effective ways and methods.
  Indeed, it is necessary to build an educational system that is capable of meeting the needs of students, promoting personal development or, in other words, the formation of a professional self-concept, on the other hand, satisfies the need for highly literate, humanitarian-oriented specialists.
  In this sense, it is not accidental to talk about the need to use information technologies, as at present they occupy a central place in the process of intellectualization of society, education and culture.
 On the other hand, in the new stage of society development, the nature and direction of the goals towards the educational process change.
 Indeed, by teaching we mean not only the presentation and assimilation of human experience, but also the acquisition of new independent knowledge in the teaching process.
The modern educational process is aimed at establishing humanistic relations between the subjects of educational activity, ensuring the adaptation of learners to socio-economic frameworks, self-affirmation, revealing the personal qualities and professional opportunities of the individual.
 This, in turn, requires the development of innovative educational technologies, which implies the use of modern information and communication technologies to positively affect the development of the individual, his professional development.
  The focus of all subjects of the educational process is the learner, the discovery and development of creative and intellectual abilities at all stages of learning.
Thus, the main function of the application of all modern learning technologies, in particular, ICT, is to gain the opportunity to acquire knowledge through different levels of science, to acquire knowledge through different levels of orientation training programs.
  And in this process it is possible to look at the learner as a subject of educational activity, and the development of his individual, personal competencies is one of the important goals of educational activity.
It is no secret that the most important condition for development and effective implementation is the high level of professional competencies of the pedagogue, as the pedagogue is considered the source of information, the bearer of the subject content, the creator of educational technologies, the manager of educational activities, etc.
The pedagogue himself fills the functional model of teaching with specific content, depending on the model he will work with.
 After that, the pedagogue answers a number of questions: what should be the level of education of the student, psychological readiness for the supposed activity to take place, how to find out the level, what goal should the students set for themselves, how to organize his activity, how Will the control take place, the evaluation of the results, by what criteria, etc.?
 For the optimal solution of these other problems, the creation of such urgent conditions should be pushed to the forefront, in which case the pedagogical staff will receive the appropriate qualification.
Of course, it is not enough to master this or that information technology, it is necessary to separate, use its features as effectively as possible, the possibilities, which to some extent can provide the solution of the above-mentioned problems.
 That is, the system of objectives և problems, their nature, the means of information construction և the way of delivery, the system of control և evaluation, the criteria և other issues must be in line with the objectives of learning [2, pp. 3-5].
            The richest possibilities of ICT should be analyzed from the point of view of psychology և didactics և used when it is necessary from the point of view of educational activities.
 The question of how effective the training program is can only be solved after testing it.
However, there are a number of psychological and pedagogical requirements that the curriculum must meet [7: 24-38].
The curriculum should: • Allow to build the content of the educational activity, taking into account the basic principles of pedagogical psychology and didactics.
• Allow to implement any method of teaching process management, the choice of which is conditioned on the one hand by the theoretical ideas of the authors of the teaching program, on the other hand by the learning goals.
• Encourage students to engage in any type of cognitive activity to achieve the basic learning objectives needed.
• The almost constant presence of strong motivations among students for learning, not due to interest in the computer, but encouraging learning motivation, students' interest in cognition.
• Provide dialogue, both external and internal, taking into account several important functions of dialogue.
 They are, by involving learners in judgments, to activate the development of their cognitive processes, to model joint (subject-subject) activities, etc.
• The content of the subject, the level of complexity of the problems should be constructed and correspond to the age opportunities and individual abilities of the students.
• The feedback should be pedagogically justified, should inform about the mistakes made, should contain information that is enough to eliminate those mistakes.
• Does not require special knowledge to enter the answer, to minimize the usual, tedious actions of entering the answer.
• Assist in solving educational problems.
• Inform the student about the purpose of learning, tell him / her how far he / she has progressed towards that goal, what are his / her main shortcomings, the nature of constantly repeating mistakes.
• Provide personalization of learning, enabling the student to make decisions about learning strategies, the nature of help, and so on.
Thus, in the information field of education, the so-called pedagogical communication takes place, in which pedagogue-computer, student-computer, pedagogue-computer-student, etc. take part.
  Of course, such communication is carried out by pedagogical scenarios of computer programs, computer programs of different educational significance, guides.
  By the way, the pedagogical scenario is a way of describing the teaching model, which includes a knowledge base (systematically organized training material, information material), a bank of teaching assignments (tasks of different levels), an algorithm for managing learning (questions, answers, students' answers, their help , hints և comments on support requests) [3, 74-77].
The development of educational programs, in contrast to pedagogical and practical activities, is incomparably difficult.
  During the development of the educational program, a computer algorithm should be created, which does not duplicate the work of the pedagogue at all, moreover, it performs the same functions presented to the pedagogue in a different way.
In addition, the development of curricula requires not only knowledge in a particular subject area, but also a comprehensive knowledge of the teaching process ողների students.
  Numerous analyzes have shown that even experienced, practical educators who have undergone special training sometimes develop rather weak training programs that yield lower results than traditional teaching methods, so programming requires in-depth knowledge and pedagogical talent.
  On the other hand, the mechanical application of the basic principles of compiling software packages on training programs poses a serious danger to the programmer.
 We must not forget that these programs manage the activities of people who have emotional qualities, motivations, interests that have a great impact on the learning process [4: 23-29].
 In this context, it is necessary to mention the fact that the effective use of the computer in the educational process is not conditioned only by the posted instructions, but it is necessary to design, develop educational conditions in which the learner will want to follow those instructions and not go against them.
 Speaking of computer training programs և e-testing, it should be noted that today there are hundreds of software programs in the field for electronic assignments, preparation and conduct of tests, but we will return to the "HotPotatoes6" software package, which provides methodological assistance to any computer expert. interactive tasks, tests կիրառ apply them in the learning process [6, 1-5].
  Moreover, the students do not need the knowledge of that program package, but only the teacher, who has to compile, edit relevant tasks, exercises within the framework of various courses.
  In particular, we focused on the practical tasks of the "History of Psychology" course, as this is a theoretical course, the purpose of which is to use the capabilities of the "HotPotatoes6" software package to strengthen the mastery of ideas and basic theoretical concepts.
 Thus, choosing a specific lesson material, we compile its practical task in the form of a "Quiz".
 Each task includes fields for possible answers, as well as other commentary fields (Fig. 1 և 2).

Thus, the presented program does not require in-depth knowledge in the field of programming from the teacher, it is enough to have the necessary and sufficient level of computer literacy.
  It is this circumstance that makes the desire to work with the mentioned program more just.
  On the other hand, as we know, any computer program, consisting of training-methodological tools, performs the following main functions, which directly affect the training and development of the person.
  These functions are: • providing information to the student in a way that is perceptible, • enabling the student to develop personal and professional competencies; .
Thus, many theoretical and experimental data allow us to confirm that the need for the use of ICT in educational activities, as well as the development of software and methodology, should be mainly aimed at the development of personal pedagogical competencies of the future pedagogue.
