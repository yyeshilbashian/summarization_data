It is known that the nature of the administrative-territorial division is determined by the state-regime structure.
  After joining the Russian Empire in 1805, the Sultanate of Shoragyal, which later became the basis for the formation of the province of Alexandropol, was one of the administrative units of Yerevan [1, p. 14].
  The principle of water distribution was the basis of the administrative-territorial division in the Yerevan shop [1, p. 15].
  In the first years of joining the Russian Empire, the sultanates were reorganized into road sections.
During the existence of 1840-1929. The borders of the province of Alexandropol (Leninakan since 1924) have been changed many times.

  The region was divided into four states.
  The province of Alexandropol with its precincts became part of the province of Tbilissi.

  Prior to the formation of the province, the Armenian region was divided into two provinces: Yerevan և Nakhichevan, six districts (Yerevan, Sharur, Surmalu, Sardarabad, Nakhichevan րդ Ordubad) և 25 mahal [11, p. 71].
  1849 On June 9, 1945, the province of Alexandropol joined the province of Yerevan.
During the first years of its formation, the province of Alexandropol was divided into two precincts, Shoragyal and Pambak.
 The natural-historical factor was taken into account when crossing the precincts.
 1862 The Lori section of the Pambakite district of Alexandropol province was annexed to the province of Tbilissi [12, p. 108].
account in the Russian Empire in 1867 The principle of demarcation of administrative-territorial borders was changed by a new division [4, p. 74].
Priority was given to the size of the area վ population.
  According to that division, the area of ​​the provinces should not exceed 6500 sq.m. again or 7150 km2 և 10 thousand. Household [2, p. 15].
  XIX century in the last quarter և XX c. From the beginning, the borders of the province of Alexandropol remained unchanged.

1906-1917 Russian Table 1 shows that an increase in the number of districts in the province has been registered, which is due to the expansion of the efficiency of territorial administration. The number of rural settlements has doubled in the presented period, in 1852-1929. The rural population increased by five times, the population by 3 times, and the urban population by 5.2 times.

 In the end, two projects of administrative-territorial division were drawn up.
  The author of the first project was Gorg Khatisyan.
  According to that project, the region would be divided into states և provinces [8, 14].
The second envisaged one state with 15 provinces [9, 25].
  The first project was to create the Alexandropol province, the region, the province of Alexandropol, the two provinces of the province of Tbilissi, one of the precincts of the province of Etchmiadzin.
  By the way, this idea was not new at all, but it was enshrined in the law on administrative-territorial reforms in the South Caucasus in 1840 [3, p. 10].

republics.
Under the newly independent Second Plan, Alexandropol was given the status of depriving the province of its first police station, with a Pambak center.
  The total population of Gavar would be 191.0 thousand [5, page 53].
  1917 By a special decree of November 27, the Transcaucasian Commissariat introduced state administration in the region.
  1918 The Transcaucasian Seym, which replaced the Commissariat on February 10, 1945, neglected the issue of demarcation and administrative division in the conditions of socio-economic and military-political instability created in the region.
 1918 At the end of May 1945, the South Caucasus was divided into three independent republics. The Republic of Armenia was divided into five provinces: Yerevan, Etchmiadzin, Nor Bayazet, Daralagyaz and Dilijan.
  As for the occupied province of Alexandropol, the Turks kept it in the administrative-territorial system.
  1918 After the withdrawal of Turkish troops in November 1945, the province of Alexandropol joined Armenia.
The authorities of the Republic of Armenia in 1919 At first they dealt with the issues of the new administrative-territorial division of the country.
According to the new administrative division of the territory of the First Republic of Armenia, the province of Alexandropol had four provinces (Duzkendi, Haji Khalil, Ghzlghoch և Horomi or Molla-Gyokcha) with 129 villages and 25 rural communities [6, p. 50].
  On February 26, 1919, by the decision of the Council of Ministers, the territory of the Republic of Armenia was divided into 10 provinces (Nakhichevan, Yerjan, Sharur, Etchmiadzin, Dilijan, Nor Bayazet, Surmalu, Daralagyaz, Gharakilisa and Alexandropol).
  1919 By the decision of May 23, 1945, Alexandropoligavar with its 13 rural communities was formed from Alexandropol, Kyavtarli և Aghi precincts.
The next administrative-territorial change of the Republic of Armenia took place in 1920.
  The republic was divided into 4 states: Ararat, Vanand, Syunik and Shirak.
  Shirak province included six provinces և 26 rural communities, 195 villages և 39 villages in the 4th precinct of Etchmiadzin province, the border settlements of Vanand province, which were close to the city of Alexandropol [6, p. 52].
Divided into seven provinces in 1929. During the first years of Soviet rule, the province of Alexandropol had a province (Aghbaba, Duzkendi, Talin, Hajikhalil, Gzilgoch, Molla Gokcha այիKyavtarli).
of rural societies [6, p. 54].
  Soviet Armenia included 14.7% of the territory of Kars district of Kars region, the whole Aghbabayit district, the rural communities of Molla Mughin of Gharamamad of Shoragyal district, the village of Araligh, which completely joined the province of Alexandropol.
A special commission is established in the State Plan of Armenia. Led by Kocharyan, a new administrative-territorial division project is being drafted on the basis of the studied materials.
  1929 On July 26, 1945, during the sitting of the Central Executive Committee "On the Bordering of the Territory of the Armenian SSR", the old administrative-territorial division was dissolved and a new one was created.
  The territory of the republic is divided into five districts (the term e-district is used instead of provinces) և 31 districts.
  The two cities, Yerevan-Leninakan, are subject to the Central Executive Committee.
The newly created Leninakan district is divided into 5 districts.
  One hectare in 1930. On September 9, the districts were dissolved by the decision of the Advisory Committee։ KGB.
  Sub-regions remain in Soviet Armenia, which increase from 31 to 26.
  The number of village councils is also reduced from 725 to 696 [7, p. 218].
Summarizing the process of administrative-territorial division and resettlement of the Alexandropoligavar period, we state that the administrative-territorial policy of the authorities of the Russian Empire was aimed at expanding the territory of the province and increasing the population of the settlements.
 Due to the development of the capitalist relations of the population in Gavar, Tiflisch was conditioned by resettlement and migration in 1897-1915.
With the construction of the Alexandropol-Yerevan railway and the high level of natural growth, the Armenian government temporarily gave priority to socio-economic, geographical and demographic factors.
  1917 The Transcaucasian separate committee developed a new pro-Armenian project for the administrative-territorial division of the South Caucasus, where the ethno-religious factor was given priority.
  The Soviet authorities in 1929 The province of Alexandropol was dissolved, and the Leninakan district with five districts was reorganized on its basis.
  The district is dissolved after one year, and the regions are preserved until the first years of independence in 1995.
