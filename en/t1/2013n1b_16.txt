Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are rapidly entering various fields of educational activity.
 It is facilitated both by external factors, which are conditioned by the general information of the society, the need for training of relevant specialists, and by internal factors, which are connected with modern computer equipment in educational systems, software distribution, adoption of state information, interstate programs, necessary information among pedagogues.
  The use of ICT tools has a really tangible impact on the intensity of teachers' work as well as the effectiveness of student teaching.
  One of the main tasks of improving the professional qualities of modern school teachers and students is to increase their professionalism in the field of ICT use.
  The introduction of computer technology in the education system provides great opportunities to improve pedagogical methods not only in the exchange of experience and creative activities, but also in solving practical problems, which are based on the accumulation of teaching materials, the use of internal information technologies, Internet technologies by teachers and students.
 The use of ICT provides great opportunities for the teacher in teaching the subject.
  Classes are accompanied by multimedia presentations, online tests, and software packages that allow learners to deepen their prior knowledge.
Teaching any subject using ICT gives students the opportunity to think, to participate in the creation of lesson material, which is accompanied by the development of their interest in the subject.
New educational technologies are characterized by the use of special computer technologies for the implementation of educational materials, such as computer design, hypertext and multimedia technologies.
 Using computer design technology, the materials of the educational documents can be formed in certain dimensions, organized in certain structures, represented in certain compositions of elements.
 They meet the aesthetic requirements for the presentation of visual information, the peculiarities of its perception և ensure the convenient reading of documents և the effective comprehension of information.
The use of modern technologies in education creates favorable conditions for the development of the learner անձ meets the requirements of modern society.
  Here we note the literate use of the information source, the assessment of its reliability, the comparison of new information with previously acquired knowledge, the ability to properly organize the information process.
The use of modern technologies in the subjects of different subjects (chemistry, physics, etc.) significantly increases the efficiency of teaching, helps to create an atmosphere of cooperation during the lesson, arouses students' interest in the material being studied.
The use of ICTs increases the interest in the lesson, activates the learners 'cognitive activities, develops their cultural opportunities, enables them to organize individual-group work, helps to improve the students' practical abilities և skills, allows them to search, develop և master different sources , as well as Internet information.
The use of ICT in the learning process can be organized in two directions: the creation of demonstrative և independent electronic work.
 In the first case, learners have the opportunity to comment on what they have seen, to make remarks, to make changes.
  With the help of text editors, the student immediately sees the results of his work: the computer emphasizes spelling, grammar, verbal and punctuation errors, և helps the student to select and correct those mistakes, as a result the learner sees և analyzes the effectiveness of his work.
Communication skills such as text comprehension, stress emphasis, planning, etc. are developed during the preparation of independent demonstrations.
 Self-creation is a more complex job that requires technical skills, various communication skills to complete the material.
  It is done on the basis of construction-research method.
  In both cases, tests on relevant subjects are developed to reinforce and test the knowledge.
Thus, the main directions of ICT use can be emphasized: • visual information / examination, visual material /, • demonstration material / exercises, tables, concepts /, • games, • control of learners' abilities and skills, • independent search of learners, creative work .
• Make the learning process creative, exploratory.
Thus, the use of ICTs has a significant impact on the intensity of teachers 'work in the education system, as well as on the effectiveness of students' teaching.
  While working with ICT tools, the personal regulation of students' thinking activities changes. The role of self-defense methods increases, the subjective level of goal achievement, the methods of activity control change, the motives are regulated.
