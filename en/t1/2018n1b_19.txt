Theories about the geography of civilizations and their spatial-temporal evolution have a high scientific significancerating, which is based on the objective requirement of revealing, perceiving and predicting modern realities [for details, see 1, p.60-66].
  In other words, the study of civilizations is an attempt to make sense of the "past", "present" and "future" of human development with a new scientific interpretation.
The purpose of this article is to identify research issuesIt completely fits into this logic.
In the article, the social component of the geographical science system was chosen to solve the research problemsperspective, as the level of development of the latter provides a wider methodological possibilities [see details 2, pp. 41-61].
We have already referred to this issue in our previous publications.
In particular, this discipline, in the current stage of theoretical-methodological re-equipment, makes the best use of the principles of synergy.
Accordingly, in this article we are not limited to the publicgeographically, but we tried to condense the publicfrom the methodological arsenal of other sciences.
 That is, we are on the same planetry to combine the research results of different disciplines, which:The point of view of the social geography chosen for the implementation, with its object of research, internal structure, methodological basis, fully satisfies the necessary requirement.
Civilization as the highest social systemmultilevel և is a multifaceted formation, which is expressed as և!in objective reality, in human subjective consciousness [4, p30].
  From this point of view, presenting the internal structure of civilization in one dimension is a rather complicated process.
  Nevertheless,we offer the following modeling with the internal structure.As a system, it is expressed as a three-dimensional և three-dimensional pyramidin the form of a subdivision of a vertex,middle, base (each with its own sub-components), as well as the three-dimensionality of the side seats, which expresses the full range of system-building elements (diagram1 /.
  In the first case, it is expressed in system-building elementsvertical connection, and in the second case, horizontal connection.

 What about?The third unit of the trinity, then as the highest type of human coexistence, local civilization is the final stage of the systemic component of coexistence.
Therefore, being located on the lower floor of the top of the pyramid,At the same time, it approaches the final stages of the other components of the system, as it is in strict agreementwith the latter.
At the base of the pyramid are separated as three side seats,which correspond to the system-building components as welland the taxonomy of the sessions.
 The latter express the componentsthe evolutionary process.
  It is built with the same system. "the middle of the pyramid.
 Moreover, each floor of the structure is completed with the coordination of its components, by which it is acquiredseparate, smaller system features.
The system-building components of civilization are those elementsThe nature of the whole system is conditioned by the existing interconnections with their unique existence.
 Given the multifaceted and multifaceted nature of the system of civilization, we conventionallyWe combine the system-building components into three groups.The term "civilization" describes the highest type of human coexistence, followed by system-building components.The first group includes the whole subcategory of human coexistence.
 It shows the whole hierarchical staircase of formation and maturation of local civilizations.
  Each degree of the latterinteracts with other components to form ևin turn, determines the formation and development of world and universal civilizations.
 Subclass levels of coexistence component correspond to ethnic groups8.
 Internal demarcation is based on both vertical subsystems and other system-building componentsexisting horizontal connections.
That is, each type of coexistence is characterized by a certain level of value identification of the individual, the corresponding degree of the value component, which is enriched in the case of successive groups.
 Identification with any group expresses the identity of an individual.
 That is, the mental sphere of the individual, which builds its own identity, brings to the forefront the relationship between the other, us and them, theirthe opposite.
  And this in turn is conditioned by the value of the individualorientations (interests, ideas, beliefs, views, feelings, principles of behavior), the unique harmonization of which forms the inner world of each person, unrepeatablethe basis of identity և personality.
 Scientific major in this fieldDiscourse refers to the foundations of the meaning of identity.
  That is,The identity of the individual has an objective affiliation, according to the fixedIn the form of conformity-non-conformity of "standards", that it should be perceived as a subjective belonging - self-categorization.
The urgency of the problem is due to the fact thatmodern typical of the development of human civilizationTrends: globalization and transnational processes align (have leveled) the value orientations of individuals խմբ coexistence groups.
  Influenced by the ongoing geopolitical, geoeconomic and geocultural transformationsAn attempt is made to revise and re-create a traditional group boundary. 8 The term "ethnic community" or "ethnos" (Greek e'thnos - people) is used.is a group of people formed on the basis of certain commonalities.
 In ArmenianIt is often equated with the term "nation", which is confusingduring internal demarcations.
 In our opinion, "ethnic community" as an international term in Armenian language thinking corresponds to "national (broadin terms of "civilization" in general "և describes the whole diversity of human coexistence.
 However, its application to certain typesI'ts wrong.
In contrast, efforts to preserve the borders of their own group are intensified, and ethno-defense mechanisms are put in place.
Thus, in modern theoretical research, the key question of identity is to discover its essence, that is:To accept belonging to the coexistence group as a subjective desire or an objective demand?
In our opinion, the subjectivism of the individual's self-categorizationis conditioned by the desire to satisfy objective requirements.
 That is, without the objective basis operating in reality, the subjective value system of individuals and groups is not complete.
  Exactly thisBy logic, we have built a system-builder of civilizationthe whole subcategory of the value component.
Accordingly, as the identification groups grow and become more complex(coexistence eggs), the richer the value components with which the individual identifies with the given coexistence egg.
As a social system, it is typical of "civilization"Constant changes in time, it is a dynamic category.
Therefore, its integrity is expressed by the spatial system-building component.
 The subordination of the latter corresponds to the stages of life.
 That is, a basis for demarcationwas accepted, in accordance with a specific type of coexistence, valuethe possibility of selling the component in time և space.
 Within which such dynamics is typical of all forms of civilization:universal, համաշխարհային global, լ local.
 However, each of them has its own process of spatial development, the interpretation of which is another research issue.
In conclusion, we can state that as a system, the multifaceted concept of "civilization" is expressed in three dimensions.in the form of a three-sided pyramid.
 Moreover, the latter is first of all characterized by sub-disciplinary three-dimensionality: peak, middle, base, where each one is distinguished by its sub-disciplinary components.
 In this case, the vertical connection of the system-creating elements is expressed.
  Besides that,The "Civilization" pyramid is characterized by the three-dimensionality of the side sessions, which completes the whole spectrum of system-building elements.
In this case, we are already dealing with horizontal connections of system-building elements.
We believe that a clear definition of the system-building elements, the connections between them, will allow to create in the practical sphere the living environment that is necessary for the full realization of its own potential.
 In other words, scientifically grounded approaches in the theoretical field should become a pillar to reveal our coexistence.to pinpoint the causes of the crisis և to address them more preciselyapproaches and completeness of different degrees of coexistencevital basis.
Thus, the clarification of civilization belongs to himAn alternative for all levels of low coexistenceis the only way to find out for a full-fledged processthe necessary environment.
