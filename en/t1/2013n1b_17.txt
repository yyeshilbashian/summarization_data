The process of learning with the help of mobile technologies is called mobile learning.
 The future of mobile learning is conditioned not only by the development of technology, but also by the development of educational materials provided by mobile technical means.
  The learning process using mobile technologies is more vivid, interesting and effective.
The aim of this work is to acquaint the most modern mobile technical means, through them the opportunities, advantages, disadvantages of the teaching process, to make spatial images with the optimal choice of mobile technical means, to display them on any flat surface.
The main technical means of mobile learning are: I. Mobile personal computers (Fig. 1), the components of which և the functions performed are the same as those of desktop computers.
  Components are reduced Optimized for mobility and energy savings.
Fig.1 The advantages of a portable personal computer over a desktop computer are: 1. They are portable.
2. Can operate without plugging in before the batteries run out.
3. The individual parts - the screen, the keyboard, the block - the pointer control device always remain connected to each other.
4. Can connect to wireless networks with built-in Wi-Fi equipment.
5. The presence of a built-in microphone, and in some models a camera և microphone.
The disadvantages of a desktop computer over a personal computer are: 1. In the case of similar characteristics, the high cost, which, along with the development of technology, decreases.
2. Low level of maximum productivity, as the sizes are very small.
  The equipment used for cooling in these special conditions has very strict limitations related to the heat removal process, due to which obstacles arise in the case of high-power processors.
  For this reason, even the average computer power output is higher than that of portable personal computers for computer games, 3D modeling, and design.
  These laptops are equipped with non-maximum productivity processors for normal operation, և use mobile types of video cards.
3. Restrictions on equipment conversion. Most laptops do not have the ability to convert video cards, and the developer դիմել need to consult the appropriate specialists to change the optical disc drive.
4. Incompatibility with different operating systems.
5. Inconvenience of operation due to the small size. Most of the keyboard shortcuts are less և the inconvenience of viewing from screens with a smaller angle of less than 14 inches, the convenience of adjusting the pointer with the finger when not using the mouse.
6. Cooling system of electrical parts. Refrigerators, despite their high speed, do not provide the necessary heat dissipation, which can sometimes lead to high-frequency noise, and chips often fail due to high temperatures.
7. High probability of injury due to mobility.
8. Repair difficulties due to small size փ fragility of parts.
Depending on the length of the diagonal, portable PCs are usually  17 inches և more common computer replacement cradles  14 to և 16 inch bulk notebooks: Notebooks,  11 to և 13.3 inches SubNotebooks,  9 to 11-inch ultra-portable laptops weighing about 1 kg;  7 to 12.1-inch netbooks, DVDs, no 7-inch palmtop or pocket computer.
Mobile PCs whose screens are based on a touch screen (ie, they are sensitive, data can be entered at the touch of a finger) are called tablet PCs.
In terms of productivity, tablet PCs are inferior to desktop PCs and laptops.
Apple, the first model of the Internet tablet, was released by Apple in 2010, the second generation - iPad 2 - in 2011, and the third generation - "The New iPad" in 2012.
Mobile PCs used for educational purposes, depending on the work done by them, are: a) mid-range laptops with a screen angle of 7 to 21 inches, text materials are used for medium-complexity work, b) multimedia laptops with a screen angle can be from 15.6 to 18.4, are used for different types of work, c) gaming laptops with a screen angle of up to 17 inches More, have a relatively large processor հզոր video card, are used for computer games և graphics, d) Mobile workstation with a screen angle of 15.4 to 17 inches, have a relatively large processor, a professional mobile video card.(e) touchscreen notebooks, the screen angle of which can be of different sizes, have a full keyboard, are used for text work.
II. Mobile electronic whiteboards (Fig. 2), in which the infrared technology used allows you to convert any flat surface (wall, ordinary blackboard, etc.) into an electronic whiteboard.
                                                    Fig. 2 Infrared technology is based on the phenomenon of fixing the position of the electronic marker, depending on the signal of the laser beam.
Projection surfaces equipped with special equipment are not required to receive signals from the projection surface.
  In order to control the work from the projection range with the help of an electronic display or electronic marker, the camera, receiving the laser beam signal, transmits the recorded image to the computer, which in turn uses a projector to display it on the board (Fig. 3).
Fig.31.Wall surface or marker board.
  2. Portable electronic whiteboard 3. Projector.
 4. Computer.
 5. Electronic display board.
Computer work can be controlled with the help of a mouse.
 The working area can reach up to 150 inches.
 You can write on the board with files of different dimensions (PPT, PDF, Word Oyster) imported to a computer.
The advantages of teaching using mobile electronic whiteboards are: 1. Available class delivery ստուգ time-saving service delivery, 2. Persuasive, observational, emotional perception of the studied objects, 3. Emergence of interest in the lesson in the learner, 4. activating teachers and students by pushing for research work.
   III. Cell phones (Fig. 4), which are designed to make telephone calls in the area of ​​cellular network coverage through telephone և base stations (multi-frequency radio receiver-transmitter).
      In the field of education, mobile phones are used, which, having the functions of a telephone և full operating system, allow downloading applications.
  One of them is the iPhone multimedia smartphone released by Apple since 2007, which runs on Apple iOS operating system, the models are: iPhone 2G, iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, iPhone 5.
The mobile phones used in the training process provide the possibility to use: 4 a technical means for projecting images on any flat surface. To exchange information by fax, internet, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, 3. camera, video camera, printer և image input, 4. headphones և microphones, 5. flash cards for data storage 6. Recorder, radio, music player և video player, 7. to exchange short messages (SMS), 8. to exchange extended messages (EMS).
  With EMS we can format the text, add images, sound - music, 9. to exchange multimedia message (MMS).
  MMS allows you to add images, videos, sound and music to your text.
 IV. Laser micromotive projectors (Fig. 5a).
  One of them is the SHOWWX + laser micromobility projector created by MicroVision, which allows you to connect smartphones, personal computers to project high-quality images and videos on any flat surface (Fig. 5b).
  10 lumens of light output, 848x480 allowable capacity, weight 122 g, external dimensions: 60x14x118 mm, can work with both power supply and battery (about 2 hours), the angle of the projector is from 0.15 to 2.5 meters.
                                       a b fig.5 The advantages of investing in technical means of mobile education in the field of education are: 1. Personalization of students' education, 2. Effective organization of the teaching process of teachers who are constantly on the move, 3. Increasing the responsibility of students by their work, 4. The emergence of interest in learning in the learner, 5. even distribution of the learning process over time. Part of the taught material is provided through extracurricular discussions (exchange of educational material by short messages), 6. organization of education in space, involving the learning process in different cities, students of countries, 7. developing the ability to work with information.
The disadvantages are that the risk of radiation exposure is still minimal. Bluetooth technology ությունը The ability to easily connect to the Internet via mobile phones raises security issues.
After knowing the possibilities, advantages and disadvantages of mobile technical means of training, we choose the necessary technical means.
  The development of spatial perception is mostly facilitated by the receipt of prominent images ևVictual and interesting display.
 Obstacles to obtaining prominent images are the complexity of constructing axiometric perspective projection by մեթոդ parallel և central projection methods և workability,  inaccuracy of constructions, which depends on the inaccuracies of the tools used, as well as the skills of the teacher։.
These barriers can be easily overcome with the use of high-powered personal computers with large video cards, which can be used by the teacher to achieve higher results by using computer software packages in the teaching process.
To ensure the accuracy and precision of the preparation of the teaching material, it is necessary to use AutoCAD, ArchiCAD drawing programs.
In order to present the educational material in a textual, other means of visual expression, interesting, it is prepared by presenting the MICROSOFT POWERPOINT program, showing a smartphone through a mobile phone, a laser microprojector.
You have to decide correctly: մեծ The size of the image diagonal (up to 2.5 m) depending on the size of the room (up to 30 m2) քանակ the number of seats (up to 30 people).
Ալ Optimal viewing area by seats.
Ժամանակահատված Demonstration time of the prepared material (beginning of the lesson, middle, end) և Duration in the lesson (about 20 minutes).
The advantages of using mobile teaching aids in the process of developing spatial concepts are: 1. The lesson is provided affordable ը what is served is checked with time saving.
2. The lesson develops the student's creative abilities.
3. The objects under study are presented convincingly, visually.
4. Work becomes a live activity during the lesson, which arouses great interest in the learner.
5. Teachers who are constantly on the move have the opportunity to effectively organize the learning process.
