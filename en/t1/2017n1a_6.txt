1. Introduction.
  All destructive strong earthquakes, as a rule, are accompanied by numerous repetitive shocks (aftershocks) yielding their intensity to the main shock, the occurrence of which is conditioned by a sharp increase of redistributed stresses in the epicenter of a strong earthquake.
 The aftershock is different according to the grouping of seismic events in space-time.
Still in 1894 The Japanese scientist Omori has put forward a hypothesis that the intensity of the aftershock is extinguished over time by a hyperbolic law.
 Developing this hypothesis, Utsu showed that the quenching of the aftershock process takes place in a unit of time [13,14].
 The recent development of seismic surveys of aftershocks, based on them, the creation of a new modified model of Omori-Utsu's law [10,12] allow the transition from previously conducted formal statistical analyzes to the emergence of this natural phenomenon, the physical meaning of its development. .
The scientific interest in the study of the aftershock process is explained by the fact that it provides an opportunity to study how volcanic processes occur in the fossil zone, their typical spatio-temporal patterns, as well as to identify the physiological and geothermal state of the seismically active fault. properties and their local heterogeneity [2,8,15].
2. Methodical approaches և analysis of results.
 Such surveys are very relevant for the seismically active and seismically dangerous Caucasus region, as one of the strongest earthquakes to date has been the comprehensive study of the Spitak (December 7, 1988, M = 7.0) and Racha (April 29, 1991, M = 7.0) earthquakes [4, 5].
The task of the present work is to assess the main characteristics of the aftershocks of strong earthquakes in the Caucasus.
  The Omori-Utsu law, which is one of the most well-grounded laws in seismology, shows that the quenching of aftershocks per unit time is done by a step-by-step law with the following modified version [10]. In this expression Λ (t) - within the given limits is the frequency of the aftershock, t0 - the moment of the main shock, K, p, c - the values ​​are the main parameters characterizing the aftershock process.
Gradual laws are generally characterized by a number of critical phenomena that occur during complex transitions in complex systems, characterized as deterministic chaos.
The initial data of the main earthquake of the strong earthquakes in the Caucasus, followed by aftershocks, were collected and coordinated from the databases of world (NEIC, CMT), regional (EMSC), republican (NSSP) seismological centers, various author catalogs [16,17,18], compiled M> 5.5 Combined e-catalog of 17 earthquakes with magnitude հիմնական main parameters of their aftershocks.
 A map of the spatial distribution of the epicenters of these earthquakes has been compiled (Fig. 1).

The epicenter map shows the segments of seismically active faults in the Caucasus region, on which the epicenters of these earthquakes are located, with stereographic images of their epicenter mechanism.
  The values ​​of the main parameters of these earthquakes are given in Table 1.
  In our estimated և Table 1, the quantitative values ​​of the dynamic parameters - disconnected voltages (Δσ), delivered seismic energy (Es), seismic moment (M0) և geometric fault geometry dimensions (L, W), which are relevant for the study of post-earthquake study ացված are filled in և .

The geometric magnitude of the epicenter was estimated by the dependencies between the magnitude M of the earthquake and the geometry of the epicenter (L, W) proposed by Riznichenko.
The delivered seismic energy was calculated by the formula lgES = K = 4 + 1.8 · Ms (Ջ) Round, and the disconnected stresses for each earthquake were estimated by the dependence proposed by Kanamori [11].
      M0 is the seismic moment, S is the area of ​​the rupture surface.
where առաքσ is the delivered voltage. The main characteristics of the aftershock process are the intensity of the aftershocks, the area of ​​the aftershock field, the number of aftershocks recorded, the strongest aftershock magnitude, the sum of the seismic energy delivered during the aftershock, the magnitude of the quake energy; [3]
The Knopov "spatio-window" method was used to determine the magnitude of the aftershock (T) և surface of the aftershock field (D), which is based on the following criteria [7,9]. where t0 is the time of the hearth, g-g0 | -The distance between the observed "main shock" of the observed aftershock is 1.45 sM0,410W1,29sM0,4410L The main parameters of strong earthquakes Table 1 Seismic moment HearthEnergy.

18 |: M0 is the magnitude of the main shock, T is the whole period of the aftershock process, D is the maximum spatial distance of the whole aftershock field, and the values ​​T և D depend on the analytical relationships after the magnitude of the main shock [9] .Analytical dependence of the surface area D on the aftershock field In addition, the actual epicenter field area was calculated using the Mapinfo Professional software package.
 The delivered cumulative seismic energy was determined by summing the seismic energies released from each aftershock, which was combined with the seismic energy delivered to the major earthquakes.
 By multiplying the number of separated aftershocks and their energy classes, the coefficients of the slope angle γ of the repetition graphs were determined.
  The quantitative values ​​of the characteristics describing the above aftershocks are given in Table 2.
