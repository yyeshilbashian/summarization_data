1. Introduction.
  All destructive և strong earthquakes as:usually accompanied by their intensity yielding to the main shockNumerous repeated shocks (aftershocks), the occurrence of which is due to a sharp increase in redistributed stresses in the epicenter of a strong earthquake.
 The aftershock is different according to the grouping of seismic events in space-time.
Still in 1894 Japanese scientist Omori put forward a hypothesis,
according to which the intensity of the aftershock process over timeextinguished by hyperbolic law.
 Developing that hypothesis, Eighty demonstrationsshowed that the quenching of the aftershock process is done gradually in a unit of time [13,14].
 The recent development of seismic surveys of aftershocks, based on which the creation of a new modified model of the Omori-Utsu law [10,12], allows the formerTo make the transition from the formal statistical analysis to the physical meaning of the emergence of this natural phenomenonto discover, to shape their patterns. [13]
The scientific interest in studying the aftershock process is explained by the fact that it provides an opportunity to study how volumes of mountain rocks occurThe processes of fragmentation of the epicenter, their typical spatio-temporal patterns, as well as to reveal the tense-deformation state of the seismically active fault, the physical-mechanical properties of the geological environment and their local inhomogeneity [2,8,15].
2. Methodical approaches և analysis of results.
 Such studies are very relevant for the seismically active and seismically dangerous Caucasus region, as some of the strongest earthquakes that have occurred here so far have been comprehensively studied in Spitak (December 7, 1988).M = 7.0) և Racha (29.04.1991, M = 7.0) earthquakes [4,5].
The task of the present work is to assess the main characteristics of the aftershocks of strong earthquakes in the Caucasus.
  The Omori-Utsu law, which is one of the most well-grounded laws in seismology, shows that the quenching of aftershocks per unit time is done by a step-by-step law with the following modified version [10].  In this expression Λ (t) - within the given limits is the frequency of the aftershock, t0 - the moment of the main shock, K, p, c - the values ​​are the main parameters characterizing the aftershock process.
In general, degree laws are characteristic of many critical phenomena that occur in complex phase systems.during the transitions, characterized as deterministic chaos.
The main shock of strong earthquakes in the Caucasus, followed byCollection of aftershock baseline data, coordinated աշխարհի global (NEIC, CMT), regional (EMSC), republican (NSSP)From the databases of seismological centers, from various author catalogs [16,17,18], 17 earthquakes with magnitude M> 5.5 were formed։ Combined electronic catalog of the main parameters of their aftershocks.
 The spatial epicenters of these earthquakes are composeddistribution map (Fig. 1).

The epicenter map shows the Caucasus regionthe seismically active segments on which they are locatedThe focal zones of those earthquakes with stereographic images of the mechanism of their epicenter.
  The values ​​of the main parameters of these earthquakes are given in Table 1.
  In our գնահատ Table 1 we fill in the dynamic parameters - disconnected voltages (Δσ),Quantitative values ​​of delivered seismic energy (Es), seismic moment (M0) և geometric fault dimensions (L, W), which are post-shockare possible characteristics for the study of the process.
 In Figure 1The stereographic images of the hearth mechanism are given in Table 1Quantitative values ​​of completed scalar seismic moments (M0) takenfrom the Harvard University e-catalog.
The geometric dimensions of the hearth rupture were estimated by Riznichenkoproposed by the geometry of the magnitude M of the earthquake: epicenterdepending on the size (L, W).
The delivered seismic energy was calculated by the formula lgES = K = 4 + 1.8 · Ms (Ջ) Round, and the disconnected stresses for each earthquake were estimated by the dependence proposed by Kanamori [11].
      M0 is the seismic moment,       S is the area of ​​the fracture surface.
where ∆σ is the delivered voltage,They are accepted as the main characteristics of the post-concussion processThe magnitude of the aftershocks, the area of ​​the aftershock field, is recordedThe number of aftershocks, the magnitude of the strongest aftershock, the total seismic energy delivered during the aftershock process, the ratios of the main earthquake և total seismic energies γ the coefficients γ of the earthquake repetition graphs [3].
Post-earthquake process (T) և Post-earthquake field (D)Knopov's "spatial-temporal" was used to determine the areawindow "method, which is based on the following criteria [7,9].     where t0 is the time of the hearth, g-g0 |: - is the distance between the observed aftershock and the main shock;

T - is the whole period of the post-concussion process,             D is the maximum spatial distance of the entire aftershock field;and the values ​​T և D depend on the magnitude of the main shockwith the following analytical links [9].In addition to the value obtained from the analytical dependence of the D field of the aftershock field, the actual epicenter field area was calculated using the Mapinfo Professional software package [6].
 The delivered cumulative seismic energy was determined by summing the seismic energies released from each aftershock, which was combined with the seismic energy delivered to the major earthquakes.
 By the number of separated aftershocks and their energy classesThe slope angle coefficients γ of the iteration graphs were determined.
  Characteristics describing the above aftershocksThe quantitative values ​​are given in Table 2.
