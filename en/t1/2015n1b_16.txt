During the transition to a twelve-year education system, changes were made in the curriculum of different subjects: new sections were added, or the material provided in the existing sections became more comprehensive.
  In particular, a new paragraph was added to the "Elements of Logic" chapter in the 11th grade natural science and mathematics stream algebra school course: "Proof և refutation.
The main methods of proving and refuting "[1].
  In this paragraph, through other methods of proving examples, the Dirichlet principle is briefly discussed, as well as some typical problems related to this principle.
It is well known how widely the Dirichlet principle is used in school mathematics.
  The application of this principle is the basis for solving many problems related to the proof found in school mathematics Olympiads.
This paper is devoted to discussing some possible applications of the Dirichlet principle.
The principle of the famous German mathematician Peter Hustav Lezen Dirichlet is usually given in the mathematical literature by the example of rabbit cages [2], that is, if there are rabbits in one cage, moreover, there will be a cage with more than one rabbit.
  The truth of this principle can be easily ascertained by the method of contradictory assumption.
The Dirichlet Generalized Principle [2] also applies to various problems, according to which if there are rabbits with a number of cages, there will be a cage with at least one rabbit.
It should be noted that the Dirichlet principle asserts when the number of rabbits is more than the number of cages.
  A similar statement can be made with a deficit when the number of rabbits is less than the number of cages, that is, if there are a number of rabbits in each cage, then there will be a cage in which there will be no rabbits.
In the mathematical literature we find algebraic-geometric variations similar to Dirichlet's principle.
  In the form of sub-theorems, we will formulate, prove, several statements based on the Dirichlet principle, which we will then use to solve various atypical problems.
Theorem 1.
 In any natural number there will always be two whose difference is divisible by.
Proof.
 As we know, the remainder obtained by dividing an arbitrary natural number by a given number can be natural or, in other words, the resulting remainder can be accepted.
 Now suppose we have rabbits ևNumber the cells accordingly to the number of possible cells.
  Let's put one of the given natural numbers in equal proportion to each of the rabbits, in particular put the given nNNnnNNkn1knNNn2; 3; 51n121; ; ; naaann0, 1,, n21nn1nn0, 1,, n21n121; ; ; naaak natural number.
  Let's agree to place the rabbit corresponding to each natural in the box whose number is equal to the remainder of dividing by a natural number.
As a result, we will have rabbits, which we have placed in individual cages, and, consequently, according to the Dirichlet principle, there will be a cage with more than one rabbit.
So when dividing the numbers corresponding to two of the rabbits in that cage by, they give the same remainder, then
.
The theorem is proved.
 Theorem 2.
 If there are several images placed in an image with a given area, the sum of their areas: a) is less than, then there will be at least one point belonging to the given image, which և does not belong to any given image, b) is greater than, then there will be at least one, which belongs to both.
  at least from the pictures.
 First, let us prove point "a" of the theorem.
 Let us first discuss the case when the posted images do not intersect.
In this case, the area of ​​the image will be equal to the sum of the areas of the images և, according to the problem condition, will be smaller than the area of ​​the image, then we can say, the image և will be found with the given image, it is impossible to cover at least one point belonging to the image.
 In this case, point "a" of the theorem is proved.
 Now suppose that some of the posted images intersect.
 From the given images we form a new set of mutually intersecting images with the following principle: let, if չունեն have no common points, we will accept, otherwise we will choose as the set of points that belong to but do not belong to ka1; 1knkakan1NnnNniajanijaanS12,, , nSiS12,,, ni12 n12,,, n12 n ii12,,, n111222221:

 Note that in this case
J and have nothing in common (we will agree to denote the area of ​​the image by).
 In the same way we will choose the set of points that belong to but do not belong to,, that is.
  We will choose the images (in particular) according to the same principle.
As a result, we have a new set of images that do not intersect with each other, such that
Therefore, according to the above proof, there will be at least one point belonging to the given image, which, or which is the same, does not belong to the image.
  The "a" point of the theorem is proved.
Now let us prove point "b" of the theorem.
  Since the images are placed in the image, it is obvious that we will make a contradictory assumption. Suppose the images do not intersect mutually, it means that the sum of their surfaces is equal to the surface of the image, so it contradicts the condition of the etheorem, that is, the sum of the placed surfaces is greater than the images.
 The resulting contradiction is due to the meritocracy, according to which the images do not intersect.
  And so at least two of the images intersect, and their intersection point is the search point that belongs to the given image.
The theorem is proved.

Let us now discuss various atypical problems, the solution of which we will use from the above-mentioned theorems.
 We encounter such a problem in the petition. to prove that there is a more general assertion.

 Sub-Problem 1.

Solution.
 Ditsuk-n-anish is a natural number.
 Consider the following natural numbers:
 According to Theorem 1, in these numbers there will be two whose difference is divisible by, that is, there exist և natural numbers such that, but since n-are mutually simple, then.
  We encounter such a problem in the petition. Is there a way to prove a more general statement?

 Solution.
  Consider the following natural numbers:
 According to Theorem 1, these numbers will contain two such that their difference is divisible by, that is, there exist such natural numbers a և b as orphans because

Let's formulate և prove a more general statement.
Problem 3.
  Prove that in the case of any և natural numbers there exists a natural number that is divisible by.
 Solution.
  Consider the following natural numbers:
  According to Theorem 1, these two natural numbers are divisible by two.
 It is easy to see that the difference between any two of these numbers is a natural number.
 We encounter such a problem in the petition. There are 1975 images inside the square of the area, the sum of the areas of which is greater than.
 Prove that there exists at least one point that belongs to all the images.
 Let's discuss a more general issue.
Problem 4.
 Individual images placed inside an image with a large sum of surfaces. Prove that there exists at least one point that belongs to all images.
  from.
 Solution.
 Define the images placed inside the given image, and assign each of those images to the pre-imaging images accordingly.
 It is obvious that each circle in the image range will belong to only one of the images.

in According to the condition of the problem, we will have the following: Thus, inside the image with area we have individual images whose area is less than, therefore, according to point "a" of Theorem 2, there will be a point inside the image that պատկ does not belong to any of those images , which means that the search item will belong to each of the given images.
Problem 5.
 There are different sections of length inside the square on the unit side.
  Prove that M և N points belonging to two of these segments will be found such that:
Solution.
  Let's prove more strict, that is.
 For each given segment, consider the geometric location of the points, the distance of each of which from the nearest point belonging to that section does not exceed.
  It is easy to notice that it will present an image composed of rectangles with dimensions of two semicircles with two radii (see Fig. 1).
The area of ​​that image will be equal. By constructing such an image for each segment, we will have 9 individual images, which are shown in Fig. 1 Նկ.21201, nSSSnS12nSSS010200120 () nnSSSSSSnSSSSnS 001nSS0Sn12; ; ; n0S12; ; ; n12; ; ; n12914MN610,2484MN0,124r0,5x0,1240,124220,523,140,172.

  It is clear that individual parts of these images can be subtracted from a given unit square, but it is obvious that they will all be in Fig. In the range shown in Figure 2, which consists of a given square of dimensions, four rectangles of size, and four quadrilateral circles of radius.
 The area of ​​this image is equal to:
Thus, we have an image with a surface in which sub-images are placed such that the sum of their surfaces will be greater than the surface of the image, therefore, according to Theorem 2, the point on image "b" belongs to at least two of these images, let's say և- in.
According to the construction of the images, we can claim the distance of the point
 does not exceed from the nearest point of the section corresponding to the image, in the same way,
 The distance from the point closest to the point corresponding to the part corresponding to the image.
  In fact, consequently, the "where's" of the given equilateral inequality are points belonging to both.
Problem 6.
  Circles with radius units are placed in a rectangle of dimensions.
 Prove that in a given rectangle it is possible to place a circle with a radius of one unit so that the latter has no common point with the mentioned circles.
Solution.
 In order for a unit radius to be completely rectangular in size, it must be sufficient that the center of the unit be inside the given rectangle, at least at a distance from the sides. 390,1721,5481; 0,124ar1x11x0,1240,1242211410,12440,124140,1243,150,1241,5454S1,545S129,,,  P129,,, 12iP1M0,124rP2N0,124r0,124PM0,124PN10,2484MNPMPNMN10x12810x121 1 1 1 1MNPQ ie the center of the search circle must in the rectangular range of binoculars / see fig. 3 /.
 On the other hand, in order for a circle with a radius of one unit not to have points in common with the eight circles given, it is necessary that its distance from the center be greater than the center of each of the eight circles given.
  Surrounding each of the given eight circles with a band with a unit radius, we have eight circles with a radius, out of which the center of the search circle must be located.
Now consider the vertices of a rectangle.
  It is clear that if any of them does not belong to any of the regions, then that very peak can be chosen as the center of the searchable region.
And if each vertex of the rectangle belongs to a certain region, then it is clear that some part of that circle will be out of the rectangle.
  Let's try to estimate the area of ​​that protruding part / see fig. 4 /.
 It is easy to notice that 4 In fact, we have a stone. A rectangle with an area of ​​one square meter, in which the sum of the areas of the regions of the regions or their separate parts exceeds sq. The unit, therefore, according to point 2 (a) of the theorem, will be a point in the rectangular domain that։ does not belong to any of these regions, և that very point will be the center of the circle with a radius of the ninth unit to be searched.
As we can see, both the Dirichlet principle (surplus-deficit) and the theorems derived from that principle or similar to the one mentioned above can have their most effective application in school mathematics when solving various atypical problems.
