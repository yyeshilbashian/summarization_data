Switching to a twelve-year education system, changes were made in the school curriculum in different subjects.New sections were added, or the material provided in the existing sections became more comprehensive.
  In particular, a new paragraph was added to the "Elements of Logic" chapter in the 11th grade natural science and mathematics stream algebra school course: "Proof և refutation.
The main methods of proving and refuting "[1].
  In this paragraph, iAmong other methods of proof, examples are briefly discussedon the Dirichlet principle, several types are suggestedProblems related to this principle.
It is well known how widely the Dirichlet principle is used in school mathematics.
  Mathematics of schoolchildrenMany problems with the evidence encountered in the OlympicsThe solution is based on the application of this principle.
This work is devoted to some possible aspects of the Dirichlet principlediscussion of applications.
Usually known in German in mathematical literatureThe principle of the mathematician Peter Hustav Lezen Dirichlet is given by the example of rabbit cages [2], that is, if is in boxesnumber of rabbits, moreoverare:, then there will be a box likein which there will be more than one rabbit.
  In the truth of this principleOne can easily be convinced by the method of contradictory assumption.
Dirichlet generalized is also used in various problemsprinciple [2], according to which if:rabbits, moreover are in boxes in number:, then there will be a box in which they will beat least rabbits.
Note that Dirichlet principle asserts in excess when rabbitsThe number is more than the number of cells.
  A similar claim can be madeWhen the number of rabbits is less than the number of cages, that is, ifmoreover are in boxes number of rabbits, then there will be a cage in which there will be no rabbits.
In mathematical literature We find algebraic-geometric differences similar to Dirichlet's principleassertions.
  We will formulate and prove in the form of sub-theoremsA few statements from the Dirichlet principle, which we will apply laterwhen solving various atypical problems.
Theorem 1.
 Any pcs always in natural numbersthere will be two whose difference is divisible by:of.
Proof.
 As we know, an arbitrary natural number is givenThe remainder of dividing by a number can be: natural  or:, that is, the resulting balance can acceptjackets.
 Now suppose we have pieces of rabbits և:Number the cells accordingly  possible cells.
  և:numbers, and put each of the rabbits in equal proportions  one of the natural numbers,in particular:Let's put it in accordance with the given rabbitnNNnnNNkn1knNNn2; 3; 51n121; ; ; naaann0, 1,, n21nn1nn0, 1,, n21n121; ; ; naaak natural number
.
  Let's agree on eachnaturalPlace the rabbit corresponding to the number in the box with the numberis equal  natural numberthe remainder generated when dividing by.
As a result, we will have: pieces of rabbits that we accommodatedin boxes, by the way, therefore, according to Dirichletprinciple, there will be a cage with more than one rabbit.
So which of the two rabbits in that cage corresponds? և: numbers: When dividing by, they give the same remainder, respectively
.
The theorem is proved.
 Theorem 2.
 If given: area: are placed in the imagefew images whose sum of areas.a) is smallfrom then it will be found at least one point belonging to the image,which is given և none image does not belong tob) is largefrom, then will be found given at least one belonging to the imagepoint that belongs to him!to both.
  at least from the imagesProof.
 First, let us prove point "a" of the theorem.
 Let's discuss firstthe case when installed The images do not intersect.
In this case  the area of ​​the image will be equal  the sum of the image areas համաձայն, according to the problemprovided it will be small from the surface of the image, then we can argue, image, և so will be giventhat: can not be covered by the image  at least one point belonging to the image, which:does not belong to the image.
 In this case, point "a" of the theorem is proved.
 Now suppose it is installed  Some of the images intersect.
 Given make images that do not intersect with each other  a new set of imageson the following principle: let
if:և:have no common points,then we will accept, otherwise as:  we will choose itthe set of points that belong tobut do not belong toka1; 1knkakan1NnnNniajanijaanS12,,, nSiS12,,, ni12 n 12,,, n12 nii12,,, n111222 221:

 Similarly as: we will select the set of points that belongbut do not belong toin և:to, that is:.
  We will elect him on the same principle. " images (in particular:).
As a result, we will have non-mutually intersecting with each other  a new set of images, such that:և:
Therefore, according to the above, it will be given  at least one point belonging to the image, which:, or the same  does not belong to the image.
  Point "a" of the theoremit is proved.
Now let us prove point "b" of the theorem.
  Sinceimages posted  in the picture, then it is obvious that  Let's make a contradictory assumption. Suppose
images do not intersect, it would meanthe sum of their areas is equal  image:on the surface, thenwhich contradictscondition of the theorem, that is, placedThe amount of areas is large  images:from.
 The resulting contradiction is our backassumption that: the images are not reciprocalintersect.
  And so  at least two of the imagesintersect, and their intersection point is the search point they belong tois given! in the picture.
The theorem is proved.

  It's easynotice that it will present an image,composed of: sized rectangle ևtwo piecesfrom semicircles with radius/ see Figure 1 /.
The area of ​​that image will be equal to:Building such an image for each section, we will have 9 piecesuniform  images of which:Fig. 1:

  It is clear that thisIndividual parts of images can be output by a given unitsquare, but it is obvious that they will all be in Fig. Pictured in 2

 This: image area is equalwill be:        .
So we have  image:  area in which they are locatedimages such that their surfacesThe amount is largepoint, will be found from the surface of the image, therefore, according to Theorem 2 of "b" such as belonging to the image point that belongs tohe! Let's put at least two of the picturesto և:to.

Problem 6.
  are placed in a rectangle of dimensions  pcsareas with a radius of one.
 Prove that in a given rectangle you can:to place a circle with a radius of one unitso that the latter does not match the mentioned regionshas no common point.
Solution.
 To score a radiusbethe district is completely located  in a rectangle of dimensions, it is necessary և enough that the center of the latterbe inside a given rectangle, itsat least from the parties  awayFig. 3:

 On the other hand, so that the search area with a radius of one does not have points in common with the eight districts given,it is necessary և enough that the distance to its center is given eightbe larger than the center of each of the districtsfrom.
  From eight districtssurrounding each with a band with a unit radius as a resultwe will have  with a radius of eight  regions outside of whichthe center of the circle must be located.
Now let's look  the vertices of the rectangle.
  It is clear that if:does not belong to any of them  to none of the districts,then that very peak can be chosen as the center of the search area.
And if: Every vertex of the rectangle belongs to something!district, then it is clear that some part of the district will be left out  rectangularfrom the domain.
  Let's try to evaluate that outthe rest area / see fig. 4 /.
 It's easynotice that:Fig. 4:
     In fact, we havesq. per unit area
  rectangle in which it is located with radius: districts orthe sum of the areas of their individual partsdoes not exceed  sq. unit, respectively, by:
Theorem of point 2 (a), There will be a point in the rectangular domain that  կետ does not belong to any of the regions, և that pointwill be the center of the circle with a search ninth unit radius.
As we can see, both the Dirichlet principle (surplus-deficit) and the theorems derived from that principle or similar to the one mentioned above can have their most effective application in school mathematics when solving various atypical problems.
