RegionsHERJanAragatsotnAraratArmavirGegharkunikLoriKotaykShirakSyunikVayots DzorTavush 4The table was compiled in 2001. The results of the census are based on the data in Tables 3.1 of the statistical information.
In all regions, including Yerevan, the share of those with general secondary education is quite high, and this indicator shows an upward trend compared to the previous census.
 The next impressive group in the system of indicators reflecting the educational level of the population are those with incomplete higher, secondary professional education.
 In any case, if in 2001 those with general secondary education and higher education made up 59.6% of the RA 15-year-old de jure population, in 2011 this figure reached 71.1%.
 If we take into account that those with general secondary education were on the verge of getting the next professional, higher education, we can claim that in the years following the census, the educational level of our society has progressed even more.
Thus, in the 2012-2013 academic year, 24597 specialists were trained in the universities of the republic, and the number of students was 90145 people5.
  In all regions, without exception, as in Yerevan, the share of those without primary education has decreased.
If in 2001 The national average of those without primary education at the census was 1.4%, then it is currently 0.5%.
 We think this is an indicator that reflects, if we can say so, the natural level of illiteracy.
 In every country there are social groups of the society, which for various reasons - natural disability, different physiological deviations - are not able to get an education, also adults who have not had the opportunity to get an education before.
  For comparison, let us note that our neighbor in Turkey in 2005 Those without primary education made up 11% of the population aged 15։.
At the same time in 2013. Experts conducted within the framework of UN Development Programs also showed that in the neighboring countries of the region, the Republic of Armenia has surpassed only Turkey in terms of human development index (Table 3).
 In our country, compared to neighboring countries, the life expectancy index is good - 74.4, and human 5 RA Statistical Yearbook 2013, Yerevan, NSS 2014, pp. 135-136. Georgia, Azerbaijan, in the other case, Georgia, Turkey.

As for the distribution of highly qualified labor force under the age of 75 among the employed population by regions, then, as evidenced by the data in Table 4, in this case, the capital has obvious advantages.
 Yerjan has 56.0% of highly qualified specialists of the republic, in which the number of advanced specialists in terms of modern, high technologies (natural engineering, mathematics, engineering, biological sciences, health specialists) reaches 23,136 people.
 This is 31.6% of the total number of highly qualified specialists in Yerevan.
 There is a reliable potential of specialists in the field of natural engineering, biological sciences and healthcare - in Shirak - 1405, in Kotayk - 1943, in Armavir - 1469, in Ararat - 1162, in Lori - 1161 people.
The general structure of high-quality specialists in all regions is that the video weight of education specialists is high.
 Among the five groups of specialists studied, the share of education in most regions, except Kotayk (45.6%), exceeds the level of 50%, and in Gegharkunik, Shirak and Lori passes more than 60%.
 In Yerevan, that index was 31.1%.
 We think that worms are a very encouraging indicator, which awakens optimistic moods, if we take into account that the specialists in the field of education are the main ones responsible for the "lifelong education" process, training of new specialists, "reproduction".
