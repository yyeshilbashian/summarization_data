Regions:RA:Yes!AragatsotnAraratArmavirGegharkunikLoriKotaykShirakSyunikVayots_DzorTavush4 The table was compiled in 2001. Census results are statistical
Based on the data in Tables 3.1.
In all regions, including Yerevan, the share of those with general secondary education is quite high.This indicator shows an upward trend compared to the previous census.
 The next impressive group in the system of indicators reflecting the educational level of the population are those with incomplete higher, secondary professional education.
 In any case, if in 2001 those with a general secondary to higher education were 15 ՀՀ in RA59.6% of the elderly permanent population, then in 2011that index reached the level of 71.1%.
 Given the generalThose with secondary education were on the verge of getting the next professional, higher education, then we can say,that in the years following the census of our societyThe level of education has improved even more.
Thus, in the 2012-2013 academic year in the universities of the republic24,597 specialists were trained and the number of students was made90145 people 5.
  In all regions without exception, such as YerevanThe share of those who do not have primary education in the city has decreased.
If in 2001 those who do not have primary education at the time of the census
The national average was 1.4%, then it is currently 0.5%.is.
 We think this is an indicator that reflects, if possiblesay, the natural level of illiteracy.
 There are different social groups in each countryDue to natural disabilities, various physiological abnormalities, they are not able to get an education, also adults who have not been educated before.had the opportunity to receive an education.
  For comparisonLet us mention that our neighbor in Turkey in 2005 Those without primary education made up 11% of the population aged 15։.
At the same time in 2013. Also conducted by experts in the framework of UN development programs
They showed that in the neighboring countries of the region, the Republic of Armenia has advanced only in the value of the human development indexFrom Turkey (Table 3).
 Compared to neighboring countries in our countryThe life expectancy index is good - 74.4, and human5 Statistical Yearbook of the Republic of Armenia 2013, Yerevan, NSS 2014, pp. 135-136Qualitative indicators that contribute to the development of capital,such as average years of education և expected education, Armenia in one case lags behind Georgia ևAzerbaijan, in the other case, Georgia and Turkey.

As for the employed population under 75 years oldAllocation of highly qualified labor force by regions,then, as evidenced by the data in Table 4, in this caseThis capital has obvious advantages.
 Yerjan has 56.0% of highly qualified specialists of the republic,in which modern, advanced in terms of high technologySpecialists (Natural Engineering, Mathematics, Engineering, Biological Sciences և HealthThe number of specialists reaches 23,136.
 This is 31.6% of the total number of highly qualified specialists in Yerevan.
 Natural engineering, biological sciences, healthcareThere is a reliable potential of specialists in the field - in Shirak - 1405, in Kotayk -1943, in Armavir - 1469, in Ararat - 1162, in Lori - 1161 people.
The general structure of high-quality specialists in all regions is that the number of specialists in the field of education is highweight.
 Among the five groups of specialists studied, the share of education in most of the regions, except Kotayk (45.6%),exceeds the 50% level, and in Gegharkunik, Shirak and Loriexceeds 60%.
 In Yerevan, that index was 31.1%.
 We think thatit is quite reassuring, optimisticIt is an indicator, if we take into account that the specialists in the field of education are the main ones responsible for the "lifelong education" process, training of new specialists, "reproduction".
