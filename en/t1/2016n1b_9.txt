Ethnographic studies of cities (in general, all types of settlements) are one of the most pressing issues of our time.
 XX century The transformations of the socio-economic, social-political system that took place in the current territory of the Republic of Armenia had a significant impact on the number, composition, resettlement, reproduction and movements of the urban population.
  Urbanization, being a progressive form of settlement [13, p. 16], has been experiencing a setback in our republic for the last twenty-five years.
  It is worth mentioning that the pre-Soviet-Soviet years were accompanied by an increase in the number of urban population, and during the years of independence it decreased.
  According to 1989 According to the last census of the USSR, the number of urban permanent population was 2368.0 thousand, which made 68.7% of the total population of the republic. Census: 2066.1 thousand men (974.8 thousand men, 1091, 3 thousand women) [9, p. 214] և 2011: 1911, 4 thousand (895, 3 thousand men, 1 016.1 thousand women) [17].
 The absolute number of the population of the Republic of Armenia in 1992-2015. It decreased by 634.7 thousand or 17.5% during the period.
 It should be mentioned that in the mentioned period the population increased by 403.3 thousand due to natural growth, and decreased by 764.2 thousand due to emigration.
  As a result, the absolute population decreased by 360.9 thousand people.
 According to the research of UN specialists in the Republic of Armenia in 1992-2014. The number of those who left during the period exceeded the number of those who came by 920 thousand [7, page 12].
  In particular, the highest rate of emigration was registered in 1991-1996, when the number of those who left the country exceeded the number of those who came by 677 thousand [8, page 14].
The main part of those who left the republic is the urban population.
 1991-2011 The absolute number of the urban population decreased by 636.9 thousand or 25.6%.
  Taking into account the natural increase of the population, it becomes known that the absolute number of the urban population of the republic has increased by 417.9 thousand or 16.8% in the presented period [9, p. 214].
 More than 80% of the decrease in the total population of our republic falls on urban areas.
  It is worth mentioning that 17% of the decrease in the urban population of the republic falls on the second city of the republic, Gyumri.
  Comparing 1999 և 2015 The difference between the absolute numbers of the urban population, we see that the population decreased by 623.1 thousand or 24.6% (see Table 1).
Now it is necessary to find out the motives and motivations of the sharp decline in the urban population.
  First of all, let's pay attention to the change in the number of urban settlements.
 During the Soviet years, the number of urban settlements in our republic increased by 14.5, and the population by 20 times [1, p. 114].
 In 1995, 10 urban settlements of the republic (Anipemza, Pemzashen, Dzoraget, Gagarin, etc.) received the status of a rural community.
 The population of those communities, according to 2001 According to the results of the census, it was 20.9 thousand people, which made up about one percent of the total urban population of the republic.
 It should be noted that it did not have a significant impact on the reduction of the urban population of the republic.
The second factor in the decrease of the urban population in 1988 December 7 was the catastrophic earthquake in Spitak. The death toll in urban areas (22.7 thousand) [1, p. 114] also contributed to a sharp decline in urban population.
 Finally, it must be stated that the main source of decrease in the urban population of the republic is emigration.

** 2001 - 2011 The number of the current population is presented.
During the compilation of the table were used: Kh. Avetisyan, geography of the population և settlements of Soviet Armenia, Yer. 1987, RA 2001 The results of the census, Yerevan, 2003, Population of the USSR 1987, M., 1988, the materials of the statistical collections of the NSS yearbooks of the Republic of Armenia.
Let us now consider the change in the number of the urban population according to the upward zones in the presented period.
 The highest urban settlement in the Republic of Armenia is the resort town of Jermuk, which is located at 2110 m above sea level and has 5800 inhabitants (2015), and the lowest is Meghri (620 m) on the border with Iran with 4500 inhabitants (2015).
  Almost half of the urban settlements of the republic are located at an altitude of 800-1400 m.
The urban population at the mentioned height, according to 2015 According to the current census, it was 80% of the total urban population of the republic և 51.2% of the population of the republic.
  For comparison, let us mention that in 1996 The absolute number of urban population living at the same height was as much as in 2015. It was the total number of the urban population.
Table 2 shows that in 1988-2015. During the intervening period, the urban population changed significantly from 800-1000 m above sea level to 1200-1600 m, which is mainly due to the significant decrease in the population of Yerevan, Gyumri and Vanadzor.
  The absolute population of Gyumri from 1988 (before the earthquake) to 2015. decreased by 124 thousand or 52.1% (annual average 1.9%).
  Ignoring the emigration factor, the population of Gyumri in 2016 only at the expense of natural growth. It was going to exceed 300 thousand.
And according to 2011 According to the census, the current population of the city was 114.4 thousand.
Famous ethnographer of Armenia G. Avagyan considered the belt with the radius of Yerevan-San as one complete agglomeration [2, p. 233].
 Yerևanaglomeration includes 15 cities of Armavir, Ararat, Kotayk marzes և Aragatsotn regional center.
  According to official statistics, the agglomeration of Yerevan had the largest population (1.7 million people) in 1996, where 67.7% of the urban population of the Republic of Armenia and 45.3% of the population of the republic lived.
 The population of Yerevan glomerulation in 1996-2011. decreased by 338 thousand or 19.7% during the period.
 More than half of the population of the agglomeration, 184.0 thousand, fell to the capital.
 For comparison, let us mention that in 1996-2011. The absolute population of Gyumri և Vanadzor cities has decreased by 189.4 thousand.
 That is, the population of the capital decreased by about 158 ​​per 1,000 people, and the population of Gyumri - Vanadzor - by 856.

The given figures prove the inefficient regional resettlement, socio-economic and demographic policy pursued by the authorities of the republic.

Largest city A city of millions The large and medium-sized cities of the Yerevan agglomeration were important centers for the development of the republic's machine-building industry in the 1970s and 1980s [11, p. 13], and now they have become rural cities.
  At present, Yerevan մի several cities close to it (Abovyan, Vagharshapat, Masis, Nor Hachn) are centrifugal, and Gyumri և Vanadzor is centrifugal.
 According to N. According to Baransky, cities, including small to medium-sized ones, are centers of accumulation of population not directly related to agriculture, which have grown due to the development of industry, craft, trade, transport, are considered administrative or socio-cultural centers [12, p. 172].
 However, this provision does not apply to the current small to medium-sized cities of Armenia, where the leading branch of economic development is agriculture, partly trade.
 According to 2011 According to the census, in 43 small and medium-sized cities of the republic, a significant part of the able-bodied population was engaged in agricultural work.
  The population of small, large and medium-sized cities of the regions of the Republic of Armenia has decreased, except for Tavush, where in 20012011. The population increased by 3465 people or 6.8%, Armavir - by 2779 or 1.5%, և Gegharkunik - by 4959 or 3.1%.
 Only the population of Artik has increased in Shirak region.
 2001 According to the census, the de jure population of Artik was 17.5 thousand, and in 2011 - 19.5 thousand.
  With the map below we present 19962011. The dynamics of the decrease of the urban population of the republic by the expressed percentage.
During the Soviet years, the village was the main source of urban population growth due to the natural increase of the population.
And in the last 25 years, the abrupt socio-economic, geopolitical changes have affected the directions and size of the internal and interstate migration flows of the population.
 During the first years of independence, the number of emigrants from urban areas to rural areas increased.
  Compared to 1987, 1994 The absolute number of people moving from rural areas to cities decreased by 3.3, and in the opposite direction increased by about 2.5 times [4, p. 275].
XX century last և XXI century. The migration process of the urban population of Armenia at the beginning of 1988 can be divided into the following main stages. The first stage: 1988-1995. The policy of state regulation in the field of migration was mainly aimed at solving the problems of Armenian refugees from Azerbaijan, a large number of those displaced from Artsakh and the former Soviet Union.
 Due to the state of emergency, the first mass migration was the evacuation of about 400,000 victims from the disaster zone.
  This was followed by the forced deportation of some 72,000 people from the border military conflict zone [3, p. 60].
During the mentioned period, among the permanent emigrants of the urban population of the republic, the overwhelming majority fell to the Armenians who emigrated from Azerbaijan.
The second stage - 1995-2001. Years of weakening of the super-high emigration intensity with some correction of the situation in the country.
  The average annual number of travelers dropped 3.5 times in 1992-1994. to the index.
The cities of Lori and Shirak marzes, especially Gyumri, Maralik, Vanadzor, Alaverdi, Stepanavan and Tashir had the highest rates of negative migration balance in the country.
The third stage - 2001-2008. The volume of emigration is decreasing.
  There have been years of economic stabilization and growth.
 Gradually slowing down The volume of permanent emigration of the urban population decreases.
 The highest rate of emigration was registered in the cities of Lori region, where the negative balance of migration was 13.0 thousand. people, including 60% fell to the city of Vanadzor [5, page 10].
The fourth stage is the years of economic crisis from 2009 to the present.
The share of the urban population among emigrants is increasing again.
  There is an influx of qualified labor to foreign countries, mainly to the Russian Federation.
The natural movement of the population had a certain impact on the decrease of the urban population of Armenia, the characteristic indicators of which are five: birth rate, mortality, natural growth, average life expectancy, special fertility rate.
  The decline in natural population growth in the 1990s was influenced by both declining birth rates and rising death tolls.
  The birth rate of the urban population of the republic has decreased about 2.5 times in the last 25 years, and the number of marriages has almost tripled.
 The number of deaths per thousand in 1987 From 5.3 people in 2014 rising to 9.2.
 At present, the average age of the urban population is 34, while in 1985 the same index was 27.
 The sex and age structure of the urban population has undergone significant changes in the presented period, in 1989. 49.1% of the current urban population were men and 50.9% were women. respectively 46.2 և 53.8 [17], in 2011 - 46% և 54% [18].
  It is clear from the presented figures that the number of elderly people is decreasing, which is conditioned by their seasonal emigration for "long" work, constant emigration and the predominance of the number of deaths.
 The following changes took place in the age structure. 1987-2011 In urban areas, the number of people under 15 has decreased 2.1 times from 701.6 thousand (which is 30.3% of the total population) to 340.3 thousand or 18.4%.
 It is true that the absolute number of the working age population has decreased from 1367.5 thousand to 1302.6 thousand, but the relative size has increased from 59% to 70.5%.
 The absolute number of the retirement age population has decreased, and the relative index has hardly changed.
 The demographic situation is especially disturbed among young people (16-30 years old).
 Only in 2009-2013. The number of young people in our republic has decreased by 101 thousand or 11.2% [10, page 15].
 The situation is even worse in urban areas, where we have the following picture.
  Thus, in 2009-2013. The number of young people in the cities decreased by 91.1 thousand or 16.7%, from 563.0 thousand to 468.9 thousand.
  By the way, 93.2% of the decrease in the number of young people in the country falls on the population of urban areas.
 Thus, in the XX century. last և XXI century. At the beginning of the 19th century, the emigration of the urban population and the sharp decline in natural reproduction led to the demographic instability of the Republic of Armenia, which poses a great threat to the survival of the Armenian ethnos and state.
