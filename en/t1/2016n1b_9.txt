Ethnographic-geographical studies of cities (in general, all types of settlements) are very popular in our timeThese are important questions.
 XX century The transformations of the socio-economic, social-political system that took place in the current territory of the Republic of Armenia had a significant impact on the number, composition, resettlement, reproduction, movements of the urban population.
on.
  Urbanization, being a progressive form of settlement [13, p. 16],It has been experiencing a setback in our republic for the last twenty-five years.
  It is worth mentioning that the pre-Soviet-Soviet years were accompanied by an increase in the number of urban population, and the years of independenceit has decreased.
  According to 1989 The last census of the USSR - urban
The number of de jure population was 2368.0 thousand, which made 68.7% of the total population of the republic. Census:
2066.1 thousand people (974.8 thousand men, 1091, 3 thousand women) [9, page 214] և 2011: 1
911, 4 thousand (895, 3 thousand men, 1 016,1 thousand women).
 The absolute number of the population of the Republic of Armenia in 1992-2015. It decreased by 634.7 thousand or 17.5% during the period.
 It should be noted that during this period the population increased by 403.3 due to natural growththousand, and due to emigration decreased by 764.2 thousand.
  As a result, the absolute population decreased by 360.9 thousand people.
 According to:UN Specialist Research in the Republic of Armenia1992-2014 The number of those who left during the period exceeded the number of those who came by 920 thousand [7, page 12].
  In particular, more emigrationA high index was registered in 1991-1996, when the number of people leaving the country exceeded the number of those who came by 677 thousand [8, page 14].
The main part of those who left the republic is the urban population.
 1991-2011 The absolute number of urban population has decreased
by 636.9 thousand or 25.6%.
  Given the natural growth of the populationThe factor becomes known to the urban population of the republicThe absolute number increased to 417.9 during the period under reviewby a thousand or 16.8% [9, p. 214].
 More than 80% of the decrease in the total population of our republic falls on urban areas.
  It is worth mentioning that 17% of the decrease in the urban population of the republic falls on the second city of the republic, Gyumri.
  Comparing 1999 և 2015 urban population
The difference between the absolute numbers, we see that the population has decreasedby 623.1 thousand or 24.6% (see Table 1).
Now it is necessary to find out the number of urban populationmotivations for decline և motivations.
  First of all, attentionWe made it on the change of the number of urban settlements.
 Soviet:During the years, the number of urban settlements of our republic increased 14.5 times, and the population increased 20 times [1, p. 114].
 In 1995, 10 urban settlements of the republic (Anipemza, Pemzashen, Dzoraget, Gagarinև etc.) received the status of a rural community.
 The population of those communities, according to 2001 According to the census, it was 20.9 thousand people, which
was about one of the entire urban population of the republicpercent.
 It should be noted that it did not have a significant impact on the reduction of the urban population of the republic.
The second factor in the decrease of the urban population in 1988 December 7 was the catastrophic earthquake in Spitak. Urban casualties
The number (22.7 thousand) [1, p. 114] also had an urban impacton a sharp decline in population.
 Finally, it must be stated that the main source of the decrease in the urban population of the republicis emigration.

** 2001 - 2011 The number of the current population is presented.
During the compilation of the table were used: Kh. Avetisyan, geography of the population և settlements of Soviet Armenia, Yer. 1987, RA 2001 The results of the census, Yerevan, 2003, Population of the USSR 1987, M., 1988, the materials of the statistical collections of the NSS yearbooks of the Republic of Armenia.
Let us now consider the change in the number of the urban population according to the upward zones in the presented period.
 The highest urban settlement in the Republic of Armenia above sea levelThe resort is Jermuk, which is located at 2110 m above sea level, has 5800 inhabitants (2015), and the lowest is Meghri on the border with Iran (620 m) with 4500 inhabitants (2015).
  Almost half of the urban settlements of the republic are located at an altitude of 800-1400 m.
The urban population at the mentioned height, according to 2015 According to the current census, it was 80% of the total urban population of the republic և 51.2% of the population of the republic.
  To compareNote that in 1996 The absolute number of urban population living at the same height was as much as in 2015. It was the total number of the urban population.
Table 2 shows that in 1988-2015. The urban population has changed significantly in the intervening period
800-1000m above sea level և 1200-1600m, which is mainly due to the population of Yerevan, Gyumri և Vanadzor citieswith a significant decrease in the number.
  The absolute population of Gyumri since 1988(before the earthquake) until 2015 decreased by 124 thousand or 52.1%
(annual average 1.9%).
  Ignoring the emigration factor is only naturalDue to the growth of the population of Gyumri in 2016. It was going to exceed 300 thousand.
And according to 2011 According to the census, the current population of the city
amounted to 114.4 thousand.
Famous ethnographer of Armenia G. Avagyan considered the belt with the radius of Yerevan-San as one complete agglomeration [2, p. 233].
 Happy!The agglomeration includes 15 regions of Armavir, Ararat and Kotaykcities և Aragatsotn regional center.
  According to official statistics, Yerevan agglomeration has the largest population (1.7 million people)In 1996, 67.7% of the urban population of the Republic of Armenia and 45.3% of the population of the republic lived.
 Happy!The number of agglomeration population in 1996-2011. decreased by 338 thousand or 19.7% during the period.
 Number of agglomeration populationMore than half of the decrease, 184.0 thousand, fell to the capital.
 For comparison, let us mention that in 1996-2011. Gyumri և Vanadzor cities
The absolute number of the population decreased by 189.4 thousand.
 That is, 1000 peopleThe population of the capital decreased by about 158, and Gyumriներին To the cities of Vanadzor with 856.

Largest cityA city of millions The large- to medium-sized cities of the Yerevan agglomeration were important centers for the development of the republic's machine-building in the 1970s and 1980s [11, p.
  Currently, several cities near Yerevan (Abovyan, Vagharshapat, Masis, Nor Hachn) are centrifugal, andGyumri և Vanadzor - centrifugal.
 According to N. Baransky: the cities, that
including small to medium, not directly related to agricultureare centers of population accumulation, which have grown due to the development of industry, craft, trade, transport.administrative or socio-cultural centers [12, p. 172].
 NeverthelessThis provision does not apply to the current small- to medium-sized cities of Armenia, where the leading branch of economic developmentIt is agriculture, partly trade.
 According to 2011 According to the census, in 43 small and medium-sized cities of the republic, a significant part of the able-bodied population was engaged in agricultural work.
  Small, large և medium size of the regions of the Republic of ArmeniaThe population of cities has decreased, except for Tavush, where in 2001-2011. population increased by 3465 people or 6.8%, Armavir -
2779 or 1.5%, եղ Gegharkunik with 4959 or 3.1%.
 Only the population of Artik has increased in Shirak region.
 2001 According to the census, the de jure population of Artik is 17.5 thousand
It was 19.5 thousand in 2011. [17]
  With the map below we present 19962011. The dynamics of the decrease of the urban population of the republic by the expressed percentage.
Natural growth of the republic's population during the Soviet yearsThe main source of urban population growth was the village.
And in the last 25 years socio-economic և geopoliticalThe drastic changes affected the directions, size and course of the internal and interstate migration flows of the population.
 During the first years of independence, the number of emigrants from urban areas to rural areas increased.
  1987compared to 1994 The absolute number of people moving from rural areas to cities decreased by 3.3, and in the opposite direction
increased about 2.5 times [4, p. 275].
XX century last և XXI century. at the beginning of the urban population of Armenia
The migration process can be divided into the following main stages:The first stage: 1988-1995. in the field of migration in the republic
The policy of state settlement was mainly aimed at Armenian refugees from Azerbaijan, Artsakh and other countries of the former USSR.to solve the problems of a large number of people displaced from the territories.
 Migration due to emergency conditionsThe first mass influx of about 400,000 people from the disaster zoneIt was the evacuation.
  This was followed by border military clashesInternal forced deportation of about 72,000 people from the area [3, p. 60].
During the mentioned period the urban population of the republicThe vast majority of permanent emigrants fellTo the Armenians deported from Azerbaijan.
The second stage - 1995-2001. Years of weakening of the super-high emigration intensity with some correction of the situation in the country.
  The average annual number of travelers dropped 3.5 times in 1992-1994. to the index.
The cities of Lori and Shirak marzes had the highest rates of negative migration balance in the country.especially Gyumri, Maralik, Vanadzor, Alaverdi, StepanavanTashir.
The third stage - 2001-2008. The volume of emigration is decreasing.
  There have been years of economic stabilization and growth.
 Gradually slowing down ևThe volume of permanent emigration of the urban population decreases.
 The highest rate of emigration was registered in the cities of Lori region, where:The negative balance of migration was 13.0 thousand. people, including 60% fell to the city of Vanadzor [5, page 10].
The fourth stage is the years of economic crisis from 2009 to the present.
The share of the urban population among emigrants is increasing again.
  There is an influx of qualified labor abroadcountries, mainly the Russian Federation.
The natural movement of the population had a certain impact on the decrease of the urban population of Armenia, the characteristic indicators of which are five: birth rate, mortality, natural growth, average life expectancy, special fertility rate.
  In the 1990sThe decline in natural population growth rates affected both birthsthe decrease in the number, as well as the increase in the number of deaths.
  RepublicThe birth rate of the urban population has decreased around the last 25 years2.5, and the number of marriages - almost three times.
 Per thousand peopleThe number of dead in 1987 From 5.3 people in 2014 rising to 9.2.
 Currently, the average age of the urban population is 34, althoughwhen in 1985 the same index was 27.
 The sex and age structure of the urban population has been significantly affected during the presented periodchange in 1989 49.1% of the current urban population are men
50.9% were women in 2001. respectively 46.2 և 53.8 [17],
In 2011, it was 46% և 54%.
  It appears from the presented figures that year after yearThe number of men is decreasing due to their seasonality"Long-term" emigration, permanent emigrationwith the predominance of the number of dead.
 And in the age structure they take placehad the following changes: 1987-2011 In urban areas, the number of children under 15 has decreased 2.1 times from 701.6 thousand (which is:
makes up 30.3% of the total population) reaching 340.3 thousand or18.4%.
 It is true that the absolute number of the working age population has decreasedIt increased from 1367.5 thousand to 1302.6 thousand, but in the index of relative size an increase was registered from 59% to 70.5%.
 Retirement:The absolute number of the aged population has decreased, and the relative index has hardly changed.
 The demographic situation is especially disturbedis for young people (16-30 years old).
 Only in 2009-2013. The number of young people in our republic has decreased by 101 thousand or 11.2% [10, p
15].
 The situation is even worse in the urban areas where we haveThe following image.
  Thus, in 2009-2013. The number of young people in the cities decreased by 91.1 thousand or 16.7%, from 563.0 thousand to 468.9 thousand.
  By the way, 93.2% of the decrease in the number of young people in the republicIt falls to the population of urban areas.
 Thus, in the XX century. last և XXI century. In the beginning of the 19th century, the emigration of the urban population led to a sharp decline in natural reproduction
