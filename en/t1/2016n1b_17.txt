Much attention is paid to the current problems of biologyOn the cellular և molecular basis of heredity, properties ման patterns of inheritance of traits, chromosomal theory of heredity, sex, ontogeny, population ևon the issues of sports genetics և immunogenetics.
  Another important issue in biology is the issue of ecologyProduction of various harmful substances, industrial wastewith the increasing reckless use of renewable և non-renewable resources.
  Taking into account "Current issues of biology"on the topic of ecological issues of a special professional subjecturgency due to the need to implement many measures for the protection of nature, reproduction of natural resources, their effective use, ecological education, as well as trying to prevent the human factorharmful effects, the task was set to find ways to solve them by using interactive methods.
By discussing environmental issues, it is possible to ensure:Harmony of plants, animals, humans և nature, genotype ընդհանուր general և of different natural complexesecological balance.
Academic knowledge is used in the teaching processresource, creation of interdisciplinary և interdisciplinary connections, acquisitionSkills and abilities to apply the knowledge brought in lifeDemonstration, application of professional theoretical knowledge in practice.
  Modern teaching methods are an opportunityEnables the development of the student's creative, logical thinking, self-expression, և distinguishing between primary and secondary goals, and developing appropriate decision-making skills, such as problem-solving.an attitude of being critical.
Modern pedagogy, in addition to the issue of providing subject-professional education, also has another important problem:Involving learners in a variety of social relationships, enabling them to make collaborative, independent decisions;Abilities and skills to take responsibility for them.
In the process of teaching biology, the formulations aimed at the development of students' logical-scientific thinking are constantly changing.
 They are interconnected, the most common of which are science, accessibility, systematization, sequence, scrutiny, and so on.
  In this processThe teaching method used by the teacher և learners և is usedIt is a set of approaches and tricks that reflect interaction.
The teaching method is chosen to make the lesson more active and interestingfor the purpose of which it is possible to develop individual,group և collaborative work skills.
  Interactive teaching methods (interactive) have started to be used in the last few years.
 These methods require more learnerscomprehensive interaction not only with the teacher but also with each otherThe activity of the students prevails during that period.
  Interactive methods at the same time ensure the involvement of almost all learners, which leads to the development of individual և collaborative skills, making the lesson more interesting, engaging և accessible.
Interactive methods provide an opportunity to increase self-esteem and self-confidence.
We have tried the latest teaching methods և with the CPC systemstudy the topic, make it more interesting, develop students' individual, group և collaborative workskills, ensuring their involvement is environmentally friendlyin the issue of coverage of the issue.
It is known that student-centered learning of all participantsInvolvement in the process develops such a moralvalues ​​such as having one's own position, compassion,will, mutual help, ability to analyze, courage ևother 1.
  Mankind today is on the verge of global changeThe reason is man.
  Most of the sun's light energy comes from the atmospherepenetrates the biosphere, is absorbed from the surface of the planet Earth,converted into thermal energy և infrared radiation reflects into space.
 However, due to some "greenhouse gases" in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), ozone (O3), methane (CH4), nitrogen dioxide (N2O), and hydrogen fluorocarbons (CFCl), the atmosphere absorbsMost of the radiation reflected from the earth, leading to "greenhouseeffect. "
  The main role in the "greenhouse effect" (64%) belongs to carbon dioxide, 19% to methane, 5.7% to nitrous oxide, 10% toto fluorocarbons.
  The latter are released into the atmosphereduring production processes, and has the bulk of N2Oծ Contributes to the depletion of the ozone layer 7.
Methane is a strong "greenhouse gas", it has a growth tendency, նրա its quantity in the atmosphere will soon double.
  Sources of methane production are agriculture, coal and natural gasextraction.
The main reasons for the increase in CO2 gas are deforestation, fires, increase in the number of cars.
Global warming changes the Earth's axis.
  TexasUniversity researchers have found that since 2005, the NorthThe load started moving east և managed to move by 1.2 meters.
  This:to prevent or mitigate destructive eventsneed to invest widely և use renewable sourcesthe energy of the earth, wind, water and the earth's crust.
We used it to study the "greenhouse effect"The "Wheel of the Future" method ել Analyze the cause and effect of the problemconnections.
 Building a detailed picture of the causes and effects:Learners are able to make the right decisions about a given issueto eliminate the consequences.
To study the causal relationship of the eventThe students used different diagrams to show the causes of the problem, which in turn led to a number of consequences.
 Noting:all causes and effects: students interactive methodsThey came to a number of conclusions, taking responsibility for each other's learning 2.
Extensive human activity in the environmentIrreversible changes have taken place.
  Planet Earth is differentman has exhausted himself due to the unintentional use of resourcesflora and fauna to the extent that the flora and faunaMany species have simply disappeared and others are still aliveon the verge of extinction.
The society, realizing the catastrophic amount of lost resources, has developed a special system of measures aimed at the rational use and conservation of natural resources.
 During the analysis of the problem, the students proposed the M-table,, where the features of renewable և non-renewable biological resources were revealed separately և Ways were suggestedin order to solve the above-mentioned problems.
  Through the M-tableThe students came to the conclusion that biological resources - plants, animals - not only have important ecological significance, but also constitute the biodiversity of biocracenosis.a means of preservation.
 They used a variety of insectsconservation as polluters in nature, emphasizingthat sanitary insects clean the nature from carcasses, rodents, andSome land-dwelling animals degrade the soil, improving itits quality and structure.
In the four-part method, the students noted the close interaction of animals as the most important heterotrophic component of biogeocenosis with the plant world, as well as microorganisms thatThey ensure the dynamic balance of nature.
Biodiversity conservation և efficient useFish were especially singled out by students at the eventRetraining the processes of artificial spawning, fish acclimatization, hunting quantity, և specifying deadlines 6.
One of the above-mentioned events can be implemented in Armeniaany for the protection of trout whitefish species living in Lake Sanaa.
 The most important task is to add artificiallyfish stocks, banning fishing.
 In Armenia, a group of divers recently conducted research on the bottom of Lake Shana(It also attracts fans of extreme darving), during whichUnderwater botanical research was carried out, bringing 10 species of high-quality plants and algae to land.
An important environmental problem is the alarming scarcity of fish stocks along with the pollution of the lake.
  DozensSwimming in the water for hours, divers have not encountered large, rare fish in various parts of Lake Shana.The largest was barely 10 cm.
 Phytoplankton and zooplankton have increased on the bottom of the lake due to the disruption of the ecosystem.They had to eat the fish.
  Divers in some areasThey were found abandoned full of rotten crayfish and fishnetworks.
There are also reserves, sanctuaries, national in Armeniaparks where very rare in the "Red Book" of Armenia were saved from destruction due to climate change and resettlementTypes of animals: bald eagle, bezoar goat, lamb ևetc.
Armenia is characterized by the species diversity of its faunaև with endemism.
 Through human activity in the last 2-3 decadeshave completely disappeared from our nature or are on the verge of extinction40 species of fish, mammals, birds ուն reptiles.
Poaching is rampant in Armenia, and it is allowedThe hunting is irregular and unorganized.
 The Caucasian nobles were completely destroyeddeer, pheasant, leopard, and only Armenian mouflon և goatSpecial specimens are left 4.
The role of flora resources from plant or autotrophic organismsin the biosphere համար for human life and productive activityIt is unique.
  There are various directions and specific ways of conservation, rational use and restoration of plant resourcesare.
 Of these, the gene pool is stored, specially protectedSeparation of territories, creation of the "Red Book" of plants, organization of forestry.
 The "Red Book" of Armenia has been studied, plants and animals have been discussed through the Venn diagramthe commonalities and differences of conservation issues.
A large number of wild representatives of cultivated plants are growing in Armeniaapple, pear, cherry, plum, aroseni, hawthorn, hornbeam,Grapes, peas, lentils that have survived alongside humans can thereforeare saved from destruction if man takes care of themattitude.
 Particular attention should be paid to wild wheat, rye, barley, Ararat wheat, Vavilov ryeRare places of growth, where there is a great diversity of species, the preservation of which անհրաժեշտ the need for cultivationIt is very possible.
After researching the issue, the students came to the conclusion that it is necessary to ensure the preservation of the gene pool of plant species, the inviolability of natural ecosystems.
Of the many types of wild pears common in ArmeniaThe Caucasian pear has been severely reduced due to deforestation.while its drought resistance to diseases and pestsHigh resistance against can be used to obtain new valuable eggs 5.
One of the "Mosaic" cooperative methodological exercises was used to discuss the issue of flora, fauna and biodiversity.
The students, forming collaborative groups, studied the same topic, performing different tasks.
 The material was studied from different angles, and the image was complete when combinedThe results of group work are 1.
Freshwater is also a current problem in biology and ecologythe problem of water.
  Fresh water is gradually gaining ground in the worldռազմ It becomes a serious political factor in international relations.
 Although that resource is consideredrenewable, but it is restored over millions of years.
 It is not a question of quantitative but qualitative elimination of waterխնդ The problem of pollution, which has become a universal, moreover, a global problem.
Fresh water is a limited ոց vulnerable resource.
  Clean andThe vital human need for safe water is explained by waterwith absolute functional irreplaceability.
The largest consumer of fresh water is agriculture.
In the current situation, the use of freshwater has increased significantly, which makes it more global for humanity.There may be a general lack of that resource.
 The amount of fresh waterto regulate չ in order not to reduce it further, it is necessary to increase the efficiency of its use.
 A number of countries have already passedto the drip irrigation system.
  Man-made in natureAlong with other factors, fresh water is gradually becoming more stablea crucial factor hindering development strategy.
  AbsolutelyIt is acceptable that in the 21st century, fresh water (not oil) will becomeThe main strategic resource of the country.
Ecological state և use of world water resourcesAgainst the background, the image of Armenia of the same name is also worrying.
  The 70 billion cubic meters of water existing in the territory of Armenia at the current level of use "technologies" "satisfies" all the requirements of the people's և life և production, at the same time ensuring the self-cleaning of rivers and basins and the ecological condition.
If fresh water was used sparingly and purposefully, then:It was possible not to worry about the reproduction of this vital resource. և From this point of view, Armenia would be considered one of the most favorable countries in the world 7.
  HoweverThe picture is different.
 More than 70% of drinking water in the Republic of Armeniais lost.
 The barbaric loss of the entrails of the Ararat Valley no onedoes not measure.
  In a number of settlements, artesian water for drinking and irrigationfor the purpose of large-diameter pipes come to the surfaceSpontaneous, unimpeded streams flow into the rivers, raising themgroundwater level, intensifying soil erosion և secondary salinization.
Large amounts of artesian water are also wasted privatelyby fish farms.
Lack of state control over drinking water and water resources in general harms the vital andstate security.
Study and analysis of freshwater issuesThe cube method was proposed by the students for the purpose of:At each session of the cube, one of the issues was mentioned, of which:Then a number of conclusions were drawn.
Thus, due to the violation of the ecological balanceThe planet is suffering from biodiversity loss, climate change, pollution, which can lead toirreversible losses.
  Desertification, population growth, uncontrolled use and consumption of natural resources have led to the extinction of mammals, amphibians բազմաթիվ many species of birds 8 .
  It is necessary for every person, any societythink of the biodiversity that guarantees the existence of the planetabout preservation նի leave it in the beauty and natural for generationsWealth that we use mercilessly.
 One must realize that a person is not oneis a species that is directly dependent on the surrounding natural environment, it just needs cooperation, consistency:to save what gives us the opportunity to live, to survive.
For a comprehensive analysis of the above issues, the students suggested an excursion method to visit the reserves.sanctuaries, national parks for the purpose of studying and conserving the species diversity of flora and faunato organize events.
After the analysis of the problems, the students suggested the ways to solve the above-mentioned problems.

Assessment was carried out at the end of the lesson, emphasizing the fact that it not only testifies to the achievements of students, teachingefficiency, but is considered a means of ensuring and improving the quality of education.
 The main purpose of assessment is for learnersIt is the testing of the level of knowledge, abilities, skills, the discovery of value qualities, based on themImproving the educational process, quality control andEnsuring the increase.
Application of interactive methods of collaborative learning ևThe following key principles were taken into account in the evaluation process: compliance, fairness, affordability, accountability, transparency, reliability 2.
It should be noted how the assessment affectson individual qualities of the learner, as well as on the person in general.
 Evaluation helps to develop perseverance, honesty, self-criticism, and its social function mostly creates a large-scale picture, on the basis of which the given analysis is properly analyzed.the issue.
Thus, teaching through interactive methods enables students to establish themselves, to be fair to each other.to evaluate, to make compromises, which ensures the processefficiency.
 In addition to the pedagogical role, teaching through interactive methods also has a social function.
 Students:By working in groups, they not only gain a variety of collaborationsskills, but a higher level of self-awareness, due to whichTrue feedback is created.
