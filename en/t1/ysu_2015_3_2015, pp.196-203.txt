THE COMPARATIVE PICTURE OF THE CLASSICAL AND CONTINUOUS GRABAR IN THE COUNTRIES OF ATHANGETHOS AND MATTHEW URHAYS Linguistic communication
"When communicating, people usually construct their speech with free connections of words in the language, and sometimes, in order to strengthen the power of their speech, to make it more accurate and pictorial, they use connections already existing in the language, accepted and valued by the society - phrases that have communication value. »1.
This study of ours is an attempt to reveal a comparative picture of what became classical և post-classical Old Armenian, based on the works of Agatangeghos ատ Matteos Urhayetsi2.
 Before pointing out the peculiarities of the idioms of the classical-post-classical periods, let us first define the idiom, answering another question: is it a stable phrase like the idiom of modern Armenian, with a reinterpretation of the components և with a stable syntax?
 The first examination of the Old Armenian translation led us to the following definition: A combination of two և more words, the components of which are mostly reinterpreted, և due to which this connection expresses a figurative idea, more often figuratively in the context, rather than being used literally, is called rendered.
Thus, in our opinion, what has become Old Armenian is not a stable connection.
Let's try to substantiate this provision. In Old Armenian, we have, for example, the so-called "answer" և "answer" with their preferred members.
 Is it possible to look at the "translation version" of the later ones (we think it is the second, since the vast majority of the translations are made in Old Armenian by means of և bilders)?
  At the same time, the question must be answered whether the phrase version has become complete.
  The "translated version", in our opinion, is complete, 1 Badikyan Kh., The translated units of modern Armenian, Yerevan, 1986, page 6.
2 The choice of authors is not random. Agatangeghos և Matteos Urahayetsi is distinguished among his contemporaries by the frequency of use of the phrases, and the language of Agatangeghos's "History" dates back to the 5th century. It belongs to a separate class of bibliography, which is called Agatangeghyan after the author of this work.
for in the corresponding verbal situation it can be used as equivalent to the "original", to be much more appropriate to the personality of the speaker, to the verbal situation.
  Let us turn to the help of examples: to crush // to sharpen swords, to fight // to fight with anyone, to put oneself to death // to toast oneself to death, to define oneself in writing // to define oneself in writing.
The Old Armenian translation, in contrast to the modern Armenian translation, is endowed with a free syntax of components, but by saying "free syntax" one should not mean the expression of any component of the translation to easily take the place of the other, to keep the meaning pure.
 Free syntax mainly refers to the free movement of the verb, which, in fact, is conditioned by its preference in speech and communication.
Through the passages in the works of Ard Agatangeghos և Matteos Urhayetsi, let us find out what figurative և reinterpreted connections were formed in the classical և post-classical regions of Grabar.
 Thus, the work of Agatangeghos, which describes the 4th century. The fateful events, especially the entry of Christianity into Armenia, stand out in its pictorial, very attractive style, due to the appropriate and purposeful use of the 256 translations, and Matteos Urhayetsi's work is a chronology, a story written in chronological order, but the author is not just a recorder of events and faces, but a researcher. he has his own approach to events and faces.
 The number of conversions is 288, that is, the quantitative difference between the conversions of the two files is small.
 Now let's see what semantic-structural groups these phrases create.
  We have divided the phrases of the History of Agatangeghos into 11 semantic groups, and the phrases of Matteos Urhayetsi's "Chronology" - 9.
  Thus, the semantic picture of the translations of Agatangeghos's work is as follows.1. Translated from the names of the parts of the body: Tie the girdle of sin (20) - to follow the path of sins, to reach behind (24), to be heartbroken (34) - to be afraid.

The comparative examination of the classical և post-classical Old Armenian translations in the works of Agatangeghos և Matteos Urhayetsi showed that the largest group of semantics are the translations related to military work.
  The components of the names of the body parts occupy the first place with the variety of their template, especially the internal meaning. The names of identical parts are used in different meanings in different meanings.
  Quantitatively prevailing (with a slight difference from those composed of the names of body parts ցույց showing movement) are those related to military affairs.
  This, of course, is not accidental. The sources we have studied, being historical works, contain numerous descriptive parts of the war, in which, of course, the translated ones have their irreplaceable role.
  As mentioned above, body-related ռազմ movement-transfer expressions are often permeated with elements of one another, which is why we differentiate between movement-transfer expressions with some reservations, summarizing only those not included in the other two groups. According to the structural analysis of the converted, then the bipartisan և energetic, quantitatively comparable, make up the majority compared to the quadrupeds, quintuplets, hexahedrons.
  We found only one seventh member in Agatanageghos (to put oneself to death).
