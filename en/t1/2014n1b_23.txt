Children are our future.
  Therefore, if there is no high-quality, effective education, there is no future.
 However, on the way to higher education, educators often do not fully realize the psychological and emotional impact of the child as a result of the strong flow of modern information.
 With age, these influences increase, and live communication and interaction decrease.
 Considering the issue from this point of view, it is not enough to take into account only the age-individual peculiarities of children in the process of upbringing educators.
 Another approach is needed.
Recently, a special culture has been formed in the field of education to provide some assistance to schoolchildren, which is commonly called pedagogical support.
  From the moment the child begins to attend school, enters a new environment, faces new social, educational, psychological "other problems", the easy, purposeful, effective solution of which requires the teacher's pedagogical support.
  Every problem or problem for a child is an emotional (fear) և operational (ignorance to overcome) deadlock, for the solution of which the support of a pedagogue is needed.
 The problems that are solved with pedagogical support are related to different areas: education, health, communication, entertainment, etc.
  The pedagogue must first of all be interested in solving the problems of the students, and secondly, that as a result of solving those problems the child will register personal growth.
For a long time, there was a stereotype in pedagogy that only those students who, for one reason or another, do not comply with accepted social norms need pedagogical support։ special attention.
  However, the prevailing idea in pedagogy is that all children, regardless of their physical, social or other status, need pedagogical support and a unique attitude.
  Today, modern schools are provided with such a team of specialists (social pedagogue, special pedagogue, psychologist Gylen), one of whose functions is to provide pedagogical support to students.
Referring to the history of pedagogy, we can say that the idea of ​​pedagogical support for students has been at the core of the principle of natural conformity of upbringing.
 It was referred to by Y. A. Komensky, I. H. Pestalozzi, J. J. Russo, K. D. Ushinsky, L. Ն. Tolstoy, J. Dewey, S. Frenen, M .; Montessori, R. Steiner և others.
  However, the main structural features of the pedagogical support were developed by the correspondent member of the RF Academy of Education, academician OS Gazman.
  Later, his students, T. V. Anokhin, V. P. Bederkhanov, N. B. Krylova, N. Ն. Mikhailova, S. D. Polyakov և others.
O. Ս. Gazman, by pedagogical support, meant preventive-operative help to the child to solve his / her personal problems related to physical-psychological health, social-economic status, progress in learning, school rules, interpersonal communication, vital, professional orientation, etc. [6, 61- 68].
There are three main directions of psychological-pedagogical support in the professional literature: • Support as education (OS Gazman, VP Bondarov, IA Lipsky, MI Rozhkov).
 Support by creating appropriate conditions for the child's self-development.
• Support as protection (SV Dudchik).
  Support ensuring the safety of the child.
• Support as individualization (EA Alexandrova, MP Bityanova, IB Levitskaya, SK Turchak).
 Support by always fulfilling the child's needs.
Pedagogical support is a long process aimed at the full development of the learner.
 It has a lasting effect on the development of the child's personality, promoting students' independence [5,167-172].
  Pedagogical support presupposes the constant presence of the teacher in the student's life, not the personal assistance only in difficult situations or in the presence of any problem.
 Pedagogical support does not imply a direct influence of the teacher on the students.
 On the contrary, it is a help in which the learners will overcome the problems they face on their own.
In other words, in case of pedagogical support, such pedagogical conditions are created - a favorable environment, which will have a beneficial effect on the development of students.
  Unfortunately, this is exactly the misunderstanding of pedagogical support in general education.
Meanwhile, the pedagogical process և interpersonal relationships in school will benefit the most in a systemic approach, when pedagogical support is considered by educators as a "way of life", a part of pedagogical essence and mastery, which is manifested not from time to time, from time to time, but in a constant hidden presence.
Pedagogical support differs from concepts such as care, care, protection.
 It is the hidden presence of the teacher in the learner's life, in which case the child can solve his / her own problems.
 If we compare the problem in the child's life with the abyss, which in order to overcome it must at least fly, then the pedagogical support appears as a strong support for safe access.
 In this case, the pedagogue acts as a trusted person in case of possible risk.
 Any positive problem-solving outcome achieved through a child's activity is viewed as a positive experience that changes attitudes toward oneself and creates positive motivation.
Walking next to the child, together with him, the pedagogue helps him with his advice and example to build his own life, to choose the way he should walk.
 Choosing that path is the right and responsibility of every child.
The pedagogue should only help to make that choice more conscious [2, 54].
The purpose of pedagogical support is to develop the child's subjective attitude towards life, to help the growing generation in self-determination, self-expression and self-development.
 To achieve all this you need a developed consciousness, will, attention, perseverance, ability to design և initiative.
• Identify the child's problems, • Help the child to understand the situation objectively, • Help to realize the importance of his role in solving his own problems խնդիրPedagogical support problems are in the accumulation of life experience, • Create conditions where the child will realize the prospects of self-development.
However, the main task of pedagogical support is to create relationships where the learner is responsible for their own problems and difficulties և can always seek the help of a teacher when their own capabilities are not sufficient.
 The pedagogue should express his / her emotional attitude towards this or that action, not forgetting the positive emphasis on the child's personality, regardless of the quality and nature of the action.
And why is pedagogical support needed?
  A number for the child to be able to successfully assimilate social values ​​and norms, to choose the way of his life, to realize it, to discover the outside world, to develop the inner world, to acquire knowledge, to develop abilities and skills.
Support assumes an activity that is performed in the following sequence with the epiles [1].
• Diagnostic phase or identification of learners' potential.
 The pedagogue, by studying the students' personal documents, folders, making observations, analyzes the individual characteristics of the children, the dynamics of development, the style of interpersonal communication, etc.
• Search phase or joint problem identification, observation from the child's point of view.
• Contractual stage or pedagogical support of students in the design of certain ways of their individual development.
• Activity phase or approval of learners' actions, encouragement of initiative.
  Modeling և implementation of relevant pedagogical situations (trainings, thematic conversations, games, etc.).
• Reflexive phase or evaluation of results և analysis.
Pedagogical support can be provided in a variety of ways: • assisting learners in making various decisions, • assisting in solving various problems, • assisting in difficult life situations, • identifying and guiding children at risk, • coordinating work with children outside of school, etc.
As a result of the analysis of practical experience in the study of pedagogical literature, we came to the conclusion that when providing pedagogical support, the pedagogue should: • create appropriate pedagogical conditions, taking into account the individual peculiarities and interests of learners, • be ready to help interact, pushing them to realize self-solving personal problems. or that behavior, but helps to realize the rights, responsibilities and opportunities; • Respect the child's free choice և exercise of independence; • Encourage the child և Teach him to take responsibility for his actions.
The strategy of pedagogical support is to transform the child from a passive role to an active subject.
 The role of the pedagogue is to teach the child to think about the following questions when facing any problem: • why, how did the problem arise, • what results does he expect to solve, how realistic is it, • what actions should be desired to achieve the result, • what are the obstacles, how to overcome them, • how will the steps he has taken affect the people who are in one way or another connected with the situation, etc.
Pedagogical support is possible only when երեխան the child agrees to help և support,  when the educator relies on the child առկա potential,, կա when there is faith in the child's abilities,  when the educator encourages the child's initiative and independence,  when there is Cooperation և mutual assistance between the child և pedagogue և երեխայի when the child's rights and human dignity are respected,  when the pedagogue is guided by the principle of "do no harm".
For successful pedagogical support it is necessary to remember some very simple but important rules [6]: 1. Always accept the child as he is.
2. A child can never be a way to achieve pedagogical goals.
3. The pedagogue's self-expression is in the student's creative self-expression.
4. Overcome all difficulties only in moral ways.
5. Keep your Բարձր Your student's dignity high.
6. Never compare one student with another.
  Compare the results with the activities carried out.
7. Trust, but check.
8. Accept the child's right to make mistakes - do not judge him.
9. Be able to admit your mistakes.
10. Protect your child by teaching him to protect himself.
11. If a child is encouraged and encouraged, he learns to be grateful.
12. If a child grows up in an honest environment, he learns to be honest.
13. If a child grows up in a safe environment, he learns to trust people.
14. If a child is constantly criticized, he learns to hate.
15. If a child grows up in hostility, he acquires aggressive traits.
16. If a child is ridiculed, he becomes closed-minded.
17. If a child grows up with constant reprimands, he learns to live with feelings of guilt.
Generalizing our studies of professional literature, let us single out a number of methods for the effective implementation of pedagogical support.1. Encouragement methods (verbal praise, commendations, awards, etc.).
2. Methods of punishment (rebuking, harsh attitude, personal conversations, etc.).
3. Methods of self-diagnosis (analyze one's abilities, abilities and behavior).
4. Method of self-assessment (give an adequate assessment of oneself, goals, means used to achieve them).
5. Method of self-organization (independently organize the daily routine, the activities carried out, etc.).
6. Self-rehabilitation method (self-restoration of physical-mental forces through frequent change of activities, creative works).
7. Method of self-determination (creating situations when the child has to make an independent choice և make a decision).
8. Method of self-expression (creating situations when the child has to do tasks individually for him).
9. Self-forecasting method (forecasting upcoming events).
10. Communication training method (role-plays, exercises Gyllen).
11. Creative search method (creative approach to solving various problems ստեղծագործ creative application of positive experience).
12. Method of gradual progress (teach the degree of action, going from easy to difficult, avoiding sharp jumps).
It should be noted that the pedagogue providing pedagogical support must have the following abilities: կարող Ability to avoid interpersonal conflicts, կարող Ability to deal with interpersonal conflicts effectively,  Organizational skills, ակց Empathy և Mutual assistance skills, ություն Ability to use all opportunities and resources.
Thus, for the effective implementation of pedagogical support, it is necessary to change or modernize the value system of pedagogues, to master new ways of interaction with students, as a result of which the child will learn to implement the mechanisms of self-determination, self-expression and self-development.
Summing up the above, we should mention that the possible goal of education should be the directed self-development of the child, help to build his own life, worldview, to become an active player in his life.
  Real self-development must lead to exceeding the limits of necessity և one's own strength.
  The mission of the pedagogue is to support the child in the difficult task of his self-development.
