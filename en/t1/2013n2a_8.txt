At the current stage of economic development, there is an unprecedented increase in the role of the financial sector in the world economy.as the growth of global financial markets.
 This reality,can not be without concern, as it not only contributes to the economydevelopment, but also creates certain serious dangers for the further development of the economy.
  Rapid globalization of the financial marketcontributes to any manifestation of financial instabilitymay spread rapidly around the world in a very short period of time, turning into global financial and economic crises.
Modern crises are significantly different from those of previous centuries.
 The point is that the nature of crises changes over time, համապատասխան the nature of anti-crisis measures գն directions change accordingly.
Referring to the general description of the previous crises, it should be noted that until the second half of the 19th century the worldThe economy was characterized by agricultural orientationIn turn, he explained the economic crises of that timeAgrarian nature due to unexpected factors related to naturewith.
  19th Century Scientific Discoveries The Industrial Revolution in Developed Capitalist Countries ‚Technical discoveries in various sectors of the economy led to the causes of crisesalready agreed with industrial factors.
  At present, in developed countries, a post-industrial structure of the economy has been formed, where the service sector predominates, and the main component of the latter is the financial sector.
  All this leads to the fact that the causes of modern crises must be explained due to the financial sector of the economy, which recentlyել significantly increased worldwide during the periodIt is moving further and further away from the real sector of the economy.
Increasing Global Financial Assets լայն The widespread use of new financial instruments, of course, has many advantages, creating opportunities for businesses to turn around.to add additional financial assets, but on the other hand, to themImproper control over this can lead to:The formation of so-called financial artificial "bubbles".
 In a situation where the financial market is able to ensure a higher percentage growth of invested funds, the financing of the real sector of the economy, which is the classic function of banks, loses its relevance.
  In the face of stiff competition, banks make moneyInstead of financing individuals and organizations in need of funds, they enter the stock market, thus contributing to the increase in the number of speculative transactions.
 It is obvious that the deepening of the discrepancies between the real and financial sectors of the economy sooner or later leads to the emergence of a financial and economic crisis, which we have witnessed quite recently.
Another important feature of modern economic developments is that the uncontrolled development of the financial sector of the economy, as well as the significant increase in the money supply in the world economy, contribute to a huge amount of speculation.capital formation, the application of which are new areasnecessary.
  As a consequence, it is happening in the world economydestabilizes normal market relations,as well as the sharp and unfounded prices of assets circulating in the marketsgrowth due to speculative capital pressures.
Referring to 2007-2009. In the global financial and economic crisis, it must be stated that it is deeply involved
to the extent that it has an impact on the world economyIt is considered to be the first unprecedented crisis in the post-war years, which revealed the development of a modern economyinternal structural asymmetries.
  As a result, there was a need to radically reconsider the economic crisisPreviously rooted scientific views on the causes, as well as the directions and tools of measures to overcome them.
The current crisis has been further exacerbated by the globalization of the economyat a high level, resulting in a crisisIt is rapidly penetrating new countries.
The global financial and economic crisis had many negative manifestations, the main ones of which are the following:• The sharp decline in real estate prices, which at the same time became one of the main causes of the crisis.
 This was due to the fact that the unreasonably high price of real estate was not formedreal supply և demand for them, other speculativeAs a result of the transactions, sooner or later that market would collapse.
• Mass development of capital from developing countries to developed countriesleakage.
 The reason was that in the conditions of falling real estate prices, there were serious liquidity problems, as a result of whichInvestors rushed to resell their assets at low prices.
And the selling prices of the latter in developing countries, in contrastdeveloped countries, were lower.
• Significant increase in budget deficit due to the fact thatthat many states had to spend from budget fundsProvide significant financial support to production and financial organizations that have liquidityserious problems were on the verge of insolvency.
• Developing a recession on a global scale.
  It:"It was first formed in developed countries, and then it spread."in developing countries.
 In such a situation, investments fell sharply due to the fact that during the crisisNegative expectations prevailed both in potential investors and in the whole society, in addition, there were liquidity problems, which we have already mentioned above.
 Different:There was a significant reduction and increase of jobs in the countriesunemployment rate.
  During the crisis, companies sought to reduce costs, and since selling assets in a crisis situation posed serious difficulties,The fastest way to cut costs was to cut jobs.
• The appreciation of the US dollar against the currencies of other countries.
In times of crisis, the assets of global enterprises and financial institutions were traded in dollars, which led to a significant increase in demand for the dollar, leading to a significant devaluation of the latter.
The global financial crisis has revealed the financial and economic systems operating in different countries of the worldthe shortcomings of their regulation.
 Or the latter were different in different countries due to the peculiarities of the economybut at the same time they are also of a general naturea number of shortcomings from which lessons should be learned all over the worldcountries.
Among the general shortcomings revealed as a result of the financial and economic crisis are the following:1. Lack of "long money" in the economy.
  And that was the reasonstock exchange indices in 2008 They were further reduced in developing countries because the shares were placed in speculative assets and were taken out of circulation immediately after the first unfavorable signal.
 There is a lack of "long money"in financial institutions and investment companies.
2. High level of inflation.
  Note that it was very developed before the crisisInflation in countries was 1-3%, while in developing countries it was kept at 3-5%.
 It should be noted that the main reason for inflation was the rapid growth of budget expenditures, which in turnwas due to the need to increase social spending, as in some developing countries there are socialist Many functions specific to the state.
3. The imperfection of financial systems is especially developingat the level of countries.
  In fact, some of the investments of enterprises and organizations fell to foreign countriesinvestors, increasing the foreign debt of developing countries, the return of which in turn has further complicated the devaluation of national currencies, as debt is mainlyare denominated in currency.
  Therefore, correct in the current situationwill be a source of repayment of external debt not only externalFormulation of new debts, but also internal debts, the source of which can be the state's gold-currency reserves and funds:on preferential terms.
4. The shortcomings of the state regulation of financial markets, as well as their imperfection of self-regulation, as a result of which a significant part of the turnover of financial assets became speculative.
5. Banking system, risky activities of banks, as wellweak control over banking oligopolies, as a result of which banks actively participated in the process of forming financial speculative "bubbles", depriving the economyMost of the funds needed for the real sector.
6. Widespread offshore financial zones և towards themLack of effective international control mechanisms.
7. Unprecedented increase in the turnover of derivatives, like him!significant predominance of speculative capital in the real economyto capital flows in the sector.
8. Promoting private consumption mainly through loans.
9. Unfair and unequal distribution of national income, which is a consequence of inefficient tax policy.
10. Information system on market processesimperfection և uneven distribution of information.
11. Lack of effective mechanisms for the supranational management of the world economy.
12. The use of the monopoly of one country's currency (US dollar) as an international means of payment in the globalization of the world economy in terms of the issue and circulation of that currencyLack of sufficient international control system.
Taking into account the above, as the main lessons of the recent global financial and economic crisis, we can present the following:1. Long-term development of the real sector of the economyCapital formation through the investment of appropriate fundswith tools ‚2. The financial and banking system, in general, the worldDevelopment of effective mechanisms for supranational management of the economy,3. Tightening the requirements for banks' credit activities;4. Diversification of the economy;5. Rapid development of market information systems;6. Reduction of foreign debts or at least new foreign debtsAvoiding wording as much as possible in order to reduce financial dependence on the external environment, so as not to carry the extra weight of high interest rates, as in the case of the country's gold.making foreign exchange reserves as a source of debt repayment,7. Following market trends during the crisis.
  It's dangerousdevalue the national currency եցնել reduce export opportunities;8. Refusal to use the US dollar as a monopoly international unit of account, which will prevent its further unsecured assets;9. Avoiding inefficient social spending, which will allowReduce both budget deficits and promote inflationreduction.
In conclusion, we can say that the nature of the crisis greatly dependsfrom the structure of the economy ներից from the dominant spheres.
  At the stage of modern economic development, crises are largely the result of disproportions in the real և financial sectors of the economy, as well as the weak control of state structures over the circulation of speculative capital.
  Therefore ‚it is necessary to develop such effective mechanisms at the global level‚which, by ensuring an optimal balance between these sectors, will contribute to the progress of the world economy, preventing it from various economic shocks.
