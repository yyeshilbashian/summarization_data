The cult of the cross is mainly the starting point for Christians.
 The apostle Paul writes about this: "For the word of the cross is foolishness to the lost, but to us who are saved it is the power of God."
 The beliefs of Christian Armenians are conditioned by the cult of the Bible-based cross, according to which many religious words and phrases, phrases and descriptive expressions, comparisons and metaphors, fables and sayings, curses and words of wish penetrated the dialect vocabulary.
The native Armenian word Khach occupies a rather large place with numerous word combinations, dialectal variables and combinations. In Acharyan's Radical Dictionary, a stick for hanging lifers, which later became a sign of Christianity. sorrow, torment ¦ [2].
The cross-semantic unit typical of literary Armenian (Araratyan, Jugha, Karabakh, Burdur, Tbilissi, Karin, Hajin, Hamshen, Malatia, Moks, Mush, Nor Nakhichevan, Shatakh, Ozm, Constantinople, Rodosto, Sebastia, Rodosto, Sebast) , Aslanbek, Peria և etc.).
Phonological parallels have been recorded in a number of dialect-speaking places, which are mainly expressed by the difference between the vowel ավեր and the last breathless deaf.
 It is noticeable that the word deaf throat is mainly stable in dialects.
 Only Turkish-speaking Armenians have h in front of x, which is explained by the absence of the consonant խ in Greek Turkish.
 The word haç (հաչ) was borrowed from Turkish.
A> a kmayin // ao // ey // a // o vowel, ch> sh // j // j with breath-sounding phonological variables, k deaf consonant, also with phonological additions, phonological comparisons are recorded in a number of dialect-speaking places.
  Swedish's Khtrbek dialect 1 Kessab dialect's increasing number of deafnesses at the end of vocabulary can be explained by the deafening of the breathing nipple.
 In the popular pronunciation of the Sebastia dialect, the vowel is increased.
In other areas we have: khaoch (Shatakh), khash (Aslanbek), khach (Mush, Martuni Madina, Bulanukhi Gyabolner, Hamshen, Ashtarak Lernarot), khach (Sasuni Inguznak և Saghdun, Khuti Shen և Taghavanc, khe) Cabusie) և etc.
in Rakert, Kessab, Beylan, Zeytun, Salmast and elsewhere.
We meet the vowelization of the first vowel (cross) In Artial, in the dialect of Tig Zeytun, the vowel is transferred to the simple vowel, leading to the khechi horse in the sexual syllable.
  In Ayntap, in addition to pointing to a cross, the Beylanumkhech's version is ambiguous.
The meaning is igo khechis ("come near me").
 In Aramo, the khech sound version becomes "my cross" when I mean "near me", and in the sentence "I go to him" (in turn to the cross) it becomes a cross.
  It can be assumed that the meaning of this expression is conditioned by the meaning of being crucified - "meet", crossroads - "meeting of the two paths".
 In the Lori dialect, being crucified has the meanings of "unexpected meeting", "unwanted meeting".
 In this case, there are synonyms with the root of the cross, in the semantic basis of which the physical image of the object of the cross in general has nothing to do with the Christian perception of the concept of the cross.
Khech phonology is also recorded in Haghbat's dialect, in the Tbilissi dialect.
 In Tbilissi (Georgia) it again appears in a multifaceted sense, meaning "icon".
 As can be seen, the reason for the ambiguity of the word cross is the general Christian content of the concepts of cross խ icon.
Khoch phonetic version has a single meaning in Hamshen, but և has a multi-meaning in several dialect areas.
 Thus, in Agulis it means "cross", "church" at the same time, in Zeytun և in Akn it is the name of one of the celestial bodies, and in Akhaltsikhe և in Yerkan it indicates the card with the sign of the cross, which the people of Van call spati (we think z + pat // game).
 One of the types of grapes is called khoch in Van.
 Probably the sacramental wine was made from this grape, and the meaning of the word arose as a result of its use.
In the Karabakh և dialects of Van, the formations with -ik, also with ascending -uk are reduced, respectively, in the sense of khachik և khachluk, meaning 'cross'.
The people of Van and Norbayazet add to the word khach the determinants of anger և otyats, forming the toponyms of Jasman khach և Otyats khach. The otyats khach is the meeting place of the apostles Thaddeus and Bartholomew.
Wrath crosses are khachkars that are placed near monasteries far from settlements, on the hills adjacent to the fields, "according to belief, they become a fortress before the wrath of God."
"Grots Brots" writes about that. "Why is the cross of wrath said? Because when there is untimely snow or hail ... it is not done by people, they consider it the wrath of God. In order to fight against that anger, they raise the image of the Cross of Christ ... before heaven և¦ [5].
On the basis of the cult of the material's symbolic object, the name Khachatur, which became widespread among Armenians, arose, from which the people of Agulis formed the names Khachi ատր Khachatr, and the Ararat dialects, Khachik, Khacho, Khicho, Khechan.
  In the dialect of Gyumushkhane settlement of Giresun, khachatur is a simple noun in the sense of "autumn fresh pear".
 It can be assumed that this type of pear ripens on the days of the Feast of the Cross.
From the dialects of the Western faction from the eastern part of Tigranakert to Shamakhi there is a cross version with the vowel extension.
 The similar version is used in Mush և Carno dialects as a form of oath to confirm what is to be said.
 Let us meet the oath of the cross in other dialect-speaking places.
 The akhach in Nor Nakhichevan // akhach - the witness of the "cross is a witness" (= that cross is a witness).
 When swearing, the people of Mshe simply say khach, the Armenians of Stanoz - khach-or, the Armenians of Caesarea, Constantinople - khach-or.
  What the man from Constantinople said is confirmed by the crucifixion.
 As it is noticeable, in this case not only the cross was testified, but also the part of the sacrament, that is, the symbol of the body of Christ.
In Havarik we find the crucifix with the definite word "stress", that is, "let the cross be a witness" (for example, "Cross, Shamam, akhri (= at the end) your stone sirtitanila of my cremation").
 The people of Yerzn have several options for taking the oath, with a cross-linkage, a cross-attachment, and a cross-changed version.
 The people of Van swear to the interlocutor with a real khach khan, the people of Constantinople swear to cross your face with instructions, especially when they consider what the interlocutor said nonsense.
The pavilion holiday dedicated to the Holy Cross, Khachverats, is composed of the word Khach.
  The definite-definite phrase of the Holy Cross in colloquial Armenian becomes sbkhech // spkhech // spkhej // spkhech (> sb + khech) as a result of phonetic և consonantal sound changes, loss of the vowel.
 The proverb Geldi Supxeç, yorğanı al, içeri geç (The spy came, take the blanket, go inside) is popular among the Armenian-Greek-Turkish speakers of Malatya, Evdokia, Caesarea, Ayntap and the Turks.
  The feast of the Holy Cross after the Holy Cross is called Khachin in the words of the people of Marash.
In the Nakhichevan dialect of the Eastern faction, the cross means "September" or "Autumn".
 The origin of the word is related to the feast of the Holy Cross.
  "March is my bride, my daughter is the cross" (Nakhichevan).
The word khach is composed of na akhach (Akhaltsikhe, Van), khachator (Araratyan, Karabakh), Hazakhach (Karabakh), khachmayr (Marash), khchhanek (Goris), khachpatatuk (Lori), khachambur (Araratyan, Mush) khachor // (Van, Mush), khachpar (Araratyan, Utik) // khachvor (Agulis), khachalam (Aries, Salmast, Kyorpalu), khachalem (Gyumushkhane, Constantinople), khachalam (Caesarea), khachkal (Araratyan, Ghazakh, Shirak, Kharak Van) այլ other religious organizations.
 In the Karabakh dialect, the words khachkal և khachamelik are used in the secular sense, "khachadz" on the door.
It should be added that in the Karabakh dialect the word khachamelik has multiple meanings "at the same time as a noun it means" Christ's crucifixion stick ", as well as as an adjective" khachadz "," cross ".
 The same meaning is expressed by Stanoz's cross-polynomial word, which first means "board moving the web's comb", then "cross-stick on the door".
 It should be noted that dialect dictionaries do not give such an explanation as to whether it is a cross attached to a wooden door or a lock forming a cross with a piece of wood.
 In the first case, of course, we would have a deep ritual content conditioned by the reality of the five-story house.
 It is known that on the evening before leaving Egypt, after sacrificing animals, God commanded the Jews: §And take a bunch of zopa, ովը soak it in the blood in the pelvis և apply the blood in the pelvis to the semen above it և on the two dorsals ¦ [3].
 The book of Exodus says that God afflicted the Egyptians with no blood mark on their doors.
 It can be assumed that the cross or the cross was placed on the doors by the power of faith, with the expectation of receiving divine pleasure, և has a religious content.
"Byurakn" magazine adds to the formations with a cross root Hamshen cross - "nig", Swedish cross - "separate with a cross mark, cross" (Did you cross the door?).
  The crosswords of Hamshen and Trabzon dialects are given in the magazine with the following explanation. "Close the door with a nigger (the niggers of the village doors are made of wood," when it passes horizontally through a vertically placed piece of wood to form a cross, from which this word originates "[4].
  It is not ruled out that the Swedish dialect's crucifixion may also mean "close".
 We can assume that the Armenians of Cilicia had a custom of crossing the doors of houses.
 This can be explained by the experience of the Jews.
  It is known that the way of the crusaders passed through Cilicia.
  The Crusaders persecuted non-believers, attacked Muslim settlements and houses, from which the local Armenians crossed the doors of their houses in order to separate themselves and declare their Christianity.
In the religious vocabulary, the cross was subjected to the succession of the literal meaning, that is, there was a loss of the old meaning of the word "... secular - HM), the acquisition of a new meaning" death ", in other words, the replacement of the former meaning of the word with a new literal meaning [1 ].
In a number of formations the word cross appears with its original secular content.
 The Armenians of Crimea and New Nakhichevan had a habit of not using the cross in secular terms.
 For example, the word "cross" was used as a synonym for the word "cross" (cross ").
 The "Mass of the Dove" writes about this that they were "out of pious fear, not wanting to use the name of the cross on simple things, but to" keep the meaning ". [6]
The verb to cross the Kharberd dialect has a secular meaning - "to cross hands".
Leaving aside the many words and phrases that have a secular content related to the cross-semantic unit, let us mention that there is always a secular-religious-interconnectedness-internal semantic connection.
 Yerjan և Ashtarak's dialects of the Ararat dialect are characterized by the word khachunj ("bundled spike"), the secular meaning of which is the religious meaning of the word khachpunj.
  P. Proshyan writes. "When the field is harvested, the wheat is crucified, brought to the owner, and fruit is taken from him as a gift, this custom has entered the time of the gardeners' work. When they finish cultivating a garden, they bring fruit in the evening and rejoice. The name of this joy remains a cross ¦ [7, p. 83].
 The cross in some way unites the religious meanings of "agapi" and "clock".
 The word khachpunj is synonymous with the adjective khachbus ("cross-texture of wheat stalks").
Thus, in the territorial versions of Armenian, the word khach appears only in phonetic versions.
 The dialect vocabulary is rich in phrases composed of the word cross, descriptive expressions, word combinations, comparisons, metaphors and other formations.
