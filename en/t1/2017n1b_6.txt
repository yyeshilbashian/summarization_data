The high scientific rating of the theories of the geography of civilizations and their spatial-temporal motion is based on the objective requirement of discovering, perceiving and predicting modern realities.
  The latter is necessarysee the current crisis in the development of the world communitywhich, in turn, completes what is presented to sciencethe content of the relevant social order.
  The latterIn general, it follows the following: make sense of a new scientific interpretation through the study of civilizations
The "past", "present" and "future" of human development.
Proof of purpose of this article և Research problemsThe demand for separation is dictated by this very logic, when:There is a need to understand, evaluate and evaluate not onlyThe process and destination of human development, but in that areaThe logic of the movement of one's own coexistence (people, nation, state).
 It is imperative of the time to discover how one's own kind is identified with the coexistence called civilization, what is one's own plane of creation and realization of civilized values.
  Does it identify with other communities?or is there its own, original, in which case it is necessary?clarify the content boundaries.
Comparing the results of the successful experiments in this field in the article, we have received our own point of view for the interpretation of the mentioned problems, complete with new theories and scientific hypotheses.
 At the same time we are sure that the proposed newTheories and methodological solutions will be the basis in this areato discover new aspects of world cognition և scientificto expand my discourse.
In terms of methodology, the methodological point of view of social geography has been chosen for the solution of research problems.
 However, due to the multi-layered nature of the object of research, the "civilization" social system, we tried at the same timeConcentrate knowledge, methods and other social sciencesmeans.
In addition, "civilization" is an open system,for the study of which the application of the former mechanical modelIt is impossible.
 Note that this model is based on the fundamentalist proposition that all phenomena of reality are the result of causal relationships.
 Therefore, the deterministic explanation of reality is true if it refers to a closed system whose development (self-development) condition matures in its subsystems.and as a result of the interaction of smaller components գործունեության integrated activities.
  Their regular course is by chanceit is almost devoid of, therefore, fully calculable և appreciable.
The situation is completely different in the case of open systems, such as civilization.
  In this case, the system is already self-developingnature and process change qualitatively, the system with the environmentexchanges energy նյութ information of the material.
  Therefore:The number of preconditions and factors conditioning its development is sharply increasing, which cannot be calculated with absolute accuracy.in practice.
Thus, we can reasonably claim that this article presents a rather complex research task, which is expressed not only by the complexity of methodological approaches և theoretical generalizations, but also by the difficulty of exchanging results.
 In particular:social systems և their identification is considered 1rather complex research problems, as it often takes a long time to be discovered as a result of scientific cognitiontheir essence, տեղը the place in the accumulated scientific knowledge system should be clarified.
  All this is especially difficult when the process of scientific recognition is not complete, և the same termor the concept is circulated in different meanings.
The modern process of scientific recognition of civilizations should be considered by this logic.
 As a social system, it has existed for millennia, but the very concept of the term։ came into scientific circulation several hundred years ago.
 And until the scientific debates on its contentThey do not stop today.
1 The term "identification" is the Armenian version of the Latin "identificāre", which meansis a psychological process of identifying oneself with another person or group of people.
It is one of the psychological defense mechanisms.
 One of the first researchers in this field is the younger daughter of Sigmund Freud.
 The term "identification" is often used as a synonym in Armenian, which, however, is the literal translation of "identification" in Russian.
Thus, the attempts to interpret the concept of "civilization" are many and multi-layered.
 Consider their detailed discussionWe are outside the scope of our research, especially since there is a lot of in-depth analysis in the professional literaturesuccessful experiments [2], [3].
Based on the evolution of scientific thought on the theory of civilizations, we can state that the keyThe problem, both in the past and in the present, concerns the definition of the scientific content of the concept of "civilization".
Civilization exists in objective realityIt is a social system, which is characterized by multi-level (multidimensional) manifestations of both structural and spatial-temporal existence.
Therefore, in order to fully discover the content of this scientific category, it is necessary to answer the following threeto the questions. What is the system, what is its structure, what is it like?
the movement.
  In this article, our research problem includes:The search for the first answer.
As a system, civilization is a certain form of social coexistence.
 That is, it is characterized by the term "civilization"a certain socio-cultural commonality of people.
  Specialists:The main scientific debate is whether the planetThe whole of humanity (past, present և future) lives on ita common coexistence, which is a universal civilizationis that civilization refers only to a certain stage of the historical development of the world society (the development of humanity)after periods of savagery և barbarism), or it represents the highest type of evolution of human coexistence:forming local civilizations.
As mentioned above, we consider civilizationas a social system, which is an objective reality operating in space and time է provides systemic fixation with human coexistence.
 That is, coexistence by the individualThe formation of this system is conditioned by the process of identification of different groups.
 It consists of various system-building components, subsystems and many elements at the same time.system component is a subsystem.
As a system, it has the following definition. a unity of parts, formed by the interaction of its elements
original whole.
  In the case of the social system itconsidered as social (social, political, theoretical,care-cultural) set of phenomena and processes, which:գտնվում are in close interaction with each other ի with the environment ևaccordingly, they form a fixation in space and time:ensuring its objective existence, functions ացումը development:as a whole.
Thus, we define "civilization"human species, its coexistence և life activity (past,present և future) operating in an objective realitysystem, which is expressed in both structural and spatial-temporal (multidimensional) manifestations.
What about the different scientific interpretations of civilization?aspects, then our ideas coincide with Russian academics BN Kuzik և Yu. V. The approach proposed by Yakovets.
  They:There were three functional concepts for the common conceptlevels [4, pp. 29-30].
  Accordingly, "civilization" is completeWe offer a three-dimensional definition for the concept.a) Human civilization,b) World civilization,c) Local civilizations.
Human civilization, as the highest type of social system, is as specific as internal system,as well as the existence of external borders.
  In the case of the latterIt is a natural component of the geographical layer, which is also characterized by the internal subordination of system-forming elements.
 But the two together are at the same time subsystems of the geographical layer, system-building components.
 And so the Earth, Solar and Space systems continue to form.
As for the internal subordination of human civilization, as the highest system of the human species, itsintegrates all types of social systems.
 Moreover,including the sectoral systems of human life - political, economic, social, spiritual-cultural systems, as well as the systems expressing the different forms of human coexistence - their spatial-temporal course.
  Despite the strong internal multiplicity as a system, it is characterized by structural systematization.
 Accordingly, universal civilization is considered a multilevel system, where the subordination of structural components is specific.
 It is the main componentAn intelligent person with his connections, relationships and interactions.
 The latter are of a sustainable nature, based on human life, are reproduced as a result of a historical process, providing both the types of world civilization operating in time and local civilizations.generational change.
Thus, universal civilization is all of humanity:in the "substantive", spatial-temporal whole of its activity.
As the highest type of social system, in addition to the structural multilayer, it also has its own developmentthe life cycle.
Specialists try to reinterpret the course of world history with the chronological component of the theory of civilizations.
  That is, currently in scientific circlesInstead of a class approach (still proposed by Marx), the whole of world history is represented by a shift of world civilizations that dominate at a particular time.
 The latter, in turn, reflects the spatial course of the "World Civilization" social system:the life cycle.
Thus, the "world civilization" social system expresses all the elements within it in the pyramid,the nature of their connections and interactions in a specific time and space.
In other words, it is revealed in a world-type wayThe geopolitical, geoeconomic, geocultural and geo-ecological structure of the planet - a specific historicalperiod.
The highest type of evolution of human coexistence is the local civilization.
  Together with the corresponding degrees of the other system-building components, they form the lower floor of the top of the "Civilization Pyramid", on which the "world civilization type" and the whole human civilization is built.
 Accordingly, local civilizations reflect the full diversity of universal world civilizations andvariability.
Local civilizations express humanity as:All the richness and multiplicity of a unified system ensure its stability, the continuity of the transmission of human cultural heritage and the enrichment of the social genotype.
That is, human coexistence of local civilizationsIn this case, he is able to realize his full potential, already creating civilized (universal) values.
Note that even today there are no common criteria for the separation of local civilizations.
 This is the main target of critics of the theory of civilizations.
  According to them,common criteria for the delimitation of local civilizationsAbsence increases subjectivism, և researchers have the opportunity to arbitrarily grant or deprive this or that coexistence of the status of civilization.
Acknowledging the objective existence of the above-mentioned problem, we see the solution in the context of revealing the structure of the "civilization" pyramid.
 Here are the vertical and horizontal elements of the systemWe accept the connections as a real reality, as a result of which the evolutionary subordination of the types of coexistence becomes obvious և accordingly, the objective basis for the separation of local civilizations.
  Following this:By logic, we can prove that it is an independent civilizationthe factors that separate points.
 They are built on the basis of value identification of communities, the original realization of those values.
 Thus, the originality of local civilizationsis expressed by the following factors:Թն Unique ethno-geographical area, Genetic originality Unique language thinking, Unique religious values original cultural values,Ինքն Unique institutionalization of values;Իր Realization of potential.
Thus, for the separation of local civilizations, we get the following logic. Local civilizations are the highest of human coexistenceare the type that create and realize unique universal values, thus conditioning the whole human life.diversity.
 The originality of the created values ​​is conditioned by the uniqueness of the ethno-geographical area, genealogy, linguistic thinking, faith and culture, their institutionalization and realization.
 They are necessary separately, but notare sufficient conditions.
 Therefore, these unique elements are simultaneousHarmony enables the creation of universal civilized values, which are carried and realized by local civilizations.
Local civilizations as a social systemThey are characterized by two important features: variable course in space and time ոչ non-homogeneity of components.
To summarize, we have been separated from local civilizations throughout human historyShift of seven generations.
  The cyclical movement of their livesThe discussion is already another research issue.
