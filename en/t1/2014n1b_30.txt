The effectiveness of any educational process is first of all conditioned by the evaluation of the quality of knowledge and evaluation.
In the case of e-learning, automated testing of knowledge is widely used, which ensures the application of flexible, advanced testing methods.
Automated knowledge testing is based on the use of pedagogical tests, the compilation of which is a scientific and labor-intensive task, based on relevant experience and rational approaches of a psychophysiological nature.
Numerous researches are carried out in the direction of creating pedagogical tests, which are aimed at the automation of the testing process and the issues of increasing its accuracy [1,17 pages].
In the education system, using computer testing technologies, the tests are used in the process of taking entrance exams, current knowledge tests, semester exams, distance learning, exams.
The computer test of the exams allows to test the knowledge of the given subject, ensures the objectivity of the assessment, frees the teacher from the laborious tests of the written works.
 It should be noted that the objectivity of computer testing և knowledge assessment largely depends on the quality of the content of the tests.
  The development of tests is one of the directions of the scientific-methodological work of teachers ախոս lecturers.
This article discusses the developmental components of pedagogical tests and their basic requirements.
There are four levels of cognition in the testing process.
At the first level, information is perceived, the subject is introduced.
  Its purpose (or task) is the recognition of objects and phenomena.
At the second level, not only the perception of information is done, but also its mechanical representation, the purpose of which (is the task) is to transfer and retell the received information.
At the third level, information is perceived, reflected, analyzed, realized and accepted based on it.
  The goal (or task) of the third level is the practical application of the acquired knowledge in various situations.
The knowledge gained at the fourth level is not only applied, but new ones are created based on them.
 The hallmark of the fourth level is the creative reproduction of new knowledge.
According to the levels of cognitive activity, four types of test tasks can be distinguished.
The first type includes tasks that facilitate the assimilation of information at the level of familiarity.
 For example, the warranty period of the product, the retention limits, etc.
The second type includes tasks that involve the learner mastering information and reproducing it at the level of simple logical operations.
The third type includes tasks that require relatively complex logical operations to master the information - the ability to act on non-standard provisions.
  According to the content, such tasks are mainly problematic են suppose interpretation, argumentation և evaluation actions.
The fourth type are problem-solving tasks, which develop efficiency, creative activity, including tasks for analysis of complex situations, heuristic search, problem-solving.
 Such tasks may be a few fundamentally correct answers that differ slightly from the standard.
 In addition, it is very important to know how the learner came to this or that solution, to find out the course of his judgments, to get acquainted with his calculations and assumptions.
 They mainly use written works to evaluate and complete the performance of such problem-solving tasks.
Test Problem Development ավտոմ Automation of Learner Skills Testing is a complex scientific-methodological problem, one of the solutions to which is the use of computer simulation business games [2, 107 pages].
And what should the test tasks be like?
The traditional questions և problems used in written և oral tests ությունների exams և problems, as a rule, can not be applied unchanged in the tests.
  Special tasks are developed for them with a test egg.
  This work, according to the workload, difficulty։ ability, can be compared with the step-by-step development of the textbook of the new educational subject.
 Experience shows 2, a significant part of some tasks are repeatedly processed և edited.
 As a result of tests on different groups of learners, the simplest, most complex and poorly formulated tasks are removed.
According to the content of the activities performed by the learner, the tasks can be divided into the following groups: • Selection of one answer, • Selection of several answers, • Search for matching between the elements of the two sets; • fill in the blanks, • post, • compile the answer, • count the answer.
Test tasks can be interrogative, affirmative, textual, tabular, graphic, etc.
The choice of the test task depends on the subject, the test assignment ընթաց current knowledge testing, taking exams, test-tutor և etc. , established habits, student specialization, computer testing capabilities և etc. .
According to the name, the same subject, for example, "Fundamentals of Informatics" for students of different professions, for example, accountants, financiers, managers, etc., is passed in different volumes.
 The issue of developing different test tasks for them depends on that.
  They usually give preference to tasks in which the probability of guessing the correct answer is close to or equal to zero.
 It is unlikely to predict the correct answers to tasks that require calculations.
It is also quite difficult to predict the correct answers to the tasks of confirmation of conformity, correct sequence, sorting and completion according to some mark [3, 24 pages].
In any case, the developed test assignments must ensure the objectivity ողների և reliability 3 of the students' knowledge assessment.
    The test assignments must meet the following requirements: • "Subject cleanliness" չ The requirement that the subjects not intersect, that is, the assignment should contain only questions related to the subject , • Logical accuracy of the content, • Local independence, • Efficiency, etc.
The test tasks are evaluated with specificity, abstraction, depth of generalization, completeness of knowledge.
The task should be clear, unambiguous and as short as possible.
Without a test, the task can not be a test.
 It is not recommended to include questions that require non-uniform answers in the test.
The difficulty of the task "complexity" mainly depends on its content և you։.
 The complexity of the task can be determined in terms of incorrect answers "ratio of incorrect answers to the total number of answers".
There may be a different number of "relatively correct" incorrect answers in the test tasks.
  It is not recommended to bring obvious incorrect answers, which the learner will recognize immediately.
Incorrect answers must be plausible.
 The short one-line answer is considered the best.
  An answer option of more than two or three lines is not recommended "large text is difficult to read".
  Lines of words in the task are also not recommended "it makes it difficult to read".
One of the requirements of the test tasks is the minimum amount of information needed for the answer - meaningless loss.
  Excessive detail, unnecessary words, characters distract the learner from the main perception.
  The poor layout of the text, careless illustration, the use of acronyms that are not universally recognized make it difficult to understand information.
  Automated knowledge testing tasks are designed to take into account the limitations of the screen և computer testing system.
 Short answers are placed in the center of the screen.
  The answer options are separated on the screen by one or two blank lines.
  Text-to-color նշ color marking is possible, but it should not distract the learner from the content of the task.
 The content of the test assignments should correspond to the materials of the lectures read, the offered textbooks, the teaching-methodological materials available to the students.
When designing tests, the following principles should be considered when selecting the content of the study material: • Choice of the most relevant knowledge, key elements; In connection with changes in the content of the subject, • the increasing difficulty of "easy" tasks that most learners do correctly, to the most difficult ones.
It is known that it is impossible to correctly determine the knowledge of students with different levels of preparation with the same test.
 Therefore, tests are often developed to test the knowledge of intermediate-level learners.
Thus, in the education system, using computer testing technologies, we can say that they increase the efficiency of the knowledge assessment process, like other forms of knowledge testing, identify gaps, encourage learning, as well as provide feedback on the quality of learning.
