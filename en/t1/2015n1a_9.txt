  Organizing a cultural landscape involves a lotcomplex, often controversial issues related to the improvement, preservation and rational use of the natural environment of human society.
 The cultural landscape has found a more visible embodiment in the rational location of different areas of economic, as well as other, use, which,they are called territorial organization.
 In this sense, we doland resources of great importance to mankindEffective use of space with proper organization.
 Especiallyfor low-income countries, such as the Republic of Armenia,Land resources should be of primary importanceIssues of spatial use of land for efficient use, in accordance with their production potential.
  The aim of the work is to propose provisions for the organization of the landscape, which will ensure a more rational use of land resources or more optimal options for them.ճիշտ The right choice of landscapes.
 The latter in case of economic use will be considered as an appropriate type of arable land (agricultural, forest, etc.).
Currently, the landscaping of the area assumesResolution of the following issues: 1) Optimal sorting of arable lands according to their significance; 2) their correct quantitative ratio, optimal size, horses ևcreating a reciprocal location that will provide the whole systemnormal function  3) Selection of mode of use - necessary reclamation - naturalin order to increase and maintain the potential [1].
The difficulty of our task is that the rapid growth of nature conservation economy has contradictions.
Obviously, the problem must first be looked at in landscape sciencefrom the point of view of leaving a specific social demand [2].
 By accepting this position, the following basic provisions can be formulated with the territorial organization of the landscape: 1. The cultural landscape should not be uniform.
 The stability of the landscape, ecological and aesthetic condition depend on its interiorfrom diversity.
 For example, a small agricultural areaArable lands, which alternate with forests, parks, reservoirs, and even swamps, are environmentally sound but reduce the use of equipment.
 In this case, it is more reasonable to use agricultural machineryadaptation to the nature of the field, not the other way around.
2. There should be no anthropogenic uncultivated lands of different origins in the cultural landscape after quarrying.Garbage piles and bad soils.
  All of these must be obeyedprocessing.
3. Priority should be given to green cover over all land use.
 The best arable land should be used for crops, but with itIt is necessary to maximize the area occupied by treesusing recultivated lands և with low productivityagricultural arable lands.
4. It is necessary to take into account the placement of handrailsMutual coordination of facies [1].
 For example, given the importance of forest protection և soil protection, it is possibleProvide forest areas not only for streams and canyonslength, but also watersheds and slopes, as vegetation is able to absorb և accumulate washed-out և driven elements:forbidding them from leaving the landscapes.
  It thus playsThe role of a potential biogeochemical barrier.
5. Rational placement of bars should be accompanied by themby increasing the potential due to various ameliorative works.
  This:From the point of view of ameliorative agro-technical measures, 3 main directions can be distinguished:5.1 Mechanical means of surface flow regulation(frost plowing, snow storage, slope plowing, border plowing,drumming, scaling of slopes).
5.2 Biological methods (forest zones, multi-branches)farms with intensive livestock breeding, rational crop rotations with rotation of dense shrubsև etc.).
5.3 Chemical methods that have a direct effect on the geochemical cycle և change it և և biologicalefficiency (application of fertilizers), աբանական biologicalprocesses (use of pesticides բ herbicides).
6. Extensive, "adaptable" land use is advisable in many landscapes to maintain the natural balance [1].
  Some experts consider the simple methods of land use to be ideal, given that, for example, nomadic livestock is more "ecological" than the regulation of the food chain.և more effective in terms of nature protection.
Of course, this method is not realistic in modern times,և Such lands can be considered as a reserve fund for intensive land use.
  However, given the specific landscape and geographical conditions, the lands are "adaptive"The use is economically purposeful.
7. In the process of territorial organization of the landscape, it is necessary to review the full or partial removal of some lands economicallyfrom use for environmental, health, cultural and educational purposes.
The highest protected areas are the reserves.
 They:serve as reference earth systems և are considered ideal places for sustainable landscape placement.
  Reserves:should be closed not only to economic activities, but also to anyfor mass visits և should be used only for scientific research.
  Every reserve is a mustbe surrounded by a buffer zone with a limit mode of use.
Unfortunately, many modern reserves, including in Armenia, They do not correspond to their significance; they are used for tourism, hunting, wild plant procurement, and other purposes.
  8. "Landscape care", ie its external improvement, of high aesthetic qualities, is also important.preservation և formation.
 From this point of view, a significant result can be achieved by rational allocation of different arable lands, land recultivation, landscaping and other means.
 Additional events are organized with the help of landscape architecture in connection with the "installation" of other structures in the landscape.
  The ways of implementing the above-mentioned provisions of the organization of the area are very different և depend first of all on the natural nature of the landscapefrom the structure, second from the social order, third from the "heritage", that is, from what we leave to the next generations.
 This way,The landscape expert's recommendations should be alternativeև Include several ways to organize the area: tentspossible ways of transformation, land reclamation, etc., so that there is an opportunity to choose a more economically optimal way.
 Although someIn some cases, it is possible to choose an option that is less economicalIt will be beneficial, but more rational in terms of maintaining natural balance and restoring it in the future.
Landscape specialists now know the theory of cultural landscape նոր the latest methodology of its design.
  One of the modeling processes taking place in agricultureis the use of information technologies in precision farming.
  Modern agriculture should be based on the latest computer technologies that will allow more efficientprocess և use information.
  "Computer software, including him, must be fully utilized in the organization of the landscape."spreadsheets, databases, GIS և other applicationsprograms [3].
 Conclusion. So, the main problem is that first of all
Preserve վի use land resources wisely.
  And one of the solutions to this problem is the spatial organization in landscapes, especially in the regions where the lands are subject to wind and water erosion, swampy or super-wet areas.
 This should include:A system of state measures that will ensure the rationalization of landuse, preservation, restoration of soil yield,creating optimal ratios of fields, in which caseThe landscape will remain unchanged.
Territorial organization should be based on economic, environmental, technical calculations that will ensure environmentally sustainable և reproductive capacitylandscape.
