The current tendencies of the society's development predict that in the future the socio-political and economic spheres will have high technological saturation.
 This equally applies to general education.
 At the current stage of educational reforms, the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) is one of the conditions for increasing the effectiveness of teaching and ensuring practical orientation.
The radical changes taking place in the field of education in the information age are closely related to the development and dissemination of modern ICT tools.
  In connection with this, there is a change in the nature of bearing education (1,2).
  The study of the peculiarities of the use of ICT in education should include the acquaintance with the various factors of the introduction of information technologies in the field of education.
 In particular, it is necessary to study in detail the technical, as well as software, used in education, and to supplement their content.
Various computer programs and the Internet are changing the ways and means of acquiring knowledge.
  Innovative teaching methods are transforming the way we teach in the classroom.
It should be noted that not all methods and programs are harmoniously involved in the educational process, which is explained by both objective and subjective factors.
 Often the computer (with a few exceptions) is used in class as a means of demonstration չի does not fully ensure student activity.
 Here we work with "fake" learning, when the computer is artificially involved in the learning process.
  This danger creates a deception of new methods, in fact, more often reduces the efficiency of the educational process.
  In the cognitive process of teaching, the computer culture of the teacher presupposes the moderate, appropriate and timely complex application of ICT tools (3,4).
It should be noted that computer technology training should be implemented only in the presence of the appropriate material base - the latest software, the computer literacy of the teacher - culture.
The versatility of a computer is to be able to process different types of information as well as perform different operations with the same type of information (5,6).
The use of computer as a teaching tool in biology pursues the following goals: a) presentation and discovery of the spatial structure, functions and features of biological objects, b) presentation of the dynamics of the mechanisms of biological processes, c) experiments with a computer model of a biological object or phenomenon, , g) assessment of the learner's own knowledge և etc.
    Usually the learner happily joins the assessment process when he / she has the opportunity to independently choose the task that is difficult according to his / her knowledge և awareness և to observe self-development.
The purpose of using computer technology in teaching biology is to develop cognitive skills based on the material being taught; second, to teach the material in a variety of collaborative ways, which in turn develops learners' communication skills.
 For example, multimedia technologies allow for the thoughtful, harmonious integration of many types of information, allowing computer-based biology lessons to be presented in a variety of forms, such as moving images with sound effects, including sketches, drawings, slides, and music. videos, animations և animation imitations.
  It is worth mentioning here that the only easily overcome negative side of multimedia media is the additional training required of a biology teacher to work with it.
The use of computer technology in teaching biology provides a number of advantages: • Increased interest in motivation ուս learning process; • Ability to model biological objects և Processes; impartiality of knowledge testing; • responds quickly to learner's actions; • provides individual work (learning);• Provides access to information resources for in-depth study of the material; • Provides հնարավորություն Rational implementation of independent work planning.
Thus, we can clearly say that the use of computer technology in the teaching of biology has indisputable advantages over other teaching aids. The success of the educational process depends on the systematic use of ICT.
The latter presupposes the creation of joint e-courses by biologists, programmers, teachers, psychologists, in accordance with the didactic principles of teaching, which must satisfy the following principles: Modern achievements  should be distinguished by simplicity of structure և efficiency of use,։ should be used high-quality computer programs designed or adapted to the biology course (taking into account the specifics of each age group).
Conclusion.
 It is obvious that the efficiency of teaching natural sciences increases when the theoretical knowledge is strengthened by laboratory-practical works.
  It is a prerequisite for the development of students' ability to acquire knowledge, to make generalizations, to make analytical thinking, to draw their own conclusions, to interpret the phenomena of nature.
  Nowadays, the existence of insufficient material and technical base of educational institutions can be compensated by the introduction of methodological norms.
With the integration of ICT, the above approaches will help students to develop the skills to conduct scientific research, analyze the results of experience, and make generalizations.
