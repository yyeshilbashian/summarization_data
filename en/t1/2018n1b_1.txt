We value the legacy of every famous poetin ideological-artistic, moral-aesthetic wealth of combined manifestations of traditional, new and original, as hefrom the point of view of affirming national, social and universal values.
 With such approaches, the best part of H. Shiraz's works have been appreciated by the readers who love his poetry և our famous writers and literary critics / S.Aghababyan 22],H. Tamrazyan [4], G. Mahari [5], S. Atabekyan [1], D. Gasparyan [3], S. Muradyan [7] և others /.
 We do not want to delve into other high-value investments in Armenian literature by our great poet, who was born in Shirak, achieved pan-Armenian fame and became a classic writer.
  With thatOur above-mentioned other, even foreign writers and literary critics have been engaged, and in recent years about H. Shiraz is unprecedented, comprehensive.The two-volume study was published by Professor Samvel Muradyan, Doctor of Philological Sciences.
 They appreciated him. "in the poet's lyric poetry on the themes of motherhood and patriarchyThe discussions, which were mainly related to "Monument to my mother" / 1968,1979,1980 / լավագույն Some of the best collections of "Monument to my father" / 2017 /with poems.
 We think there is a need for a poetto analyze the above-mentioned works in the framework of the genre he used (poem with poems)from the point of view of the content of the poemstaking modern literary ideas and methodology.
 The author's description of the genre is already interesting in itself.
 H. Shiraz considered the literary type of the first collection / "Monument to my mother" / "Poem with woven poems", the second simply "Poem with poems".
Poetic series, then poems with poems in world lyric poetry were written especially often in the 19th century.During the 20th century ին at the beginning of the 20th century.
  Significant designs have been createdW. Goethe, J. Byron, A. Pushkin, A. The block, A. Akhmatova, I. Brodsky,
K. Balmont և others.
  In natural literature in Armenian literatureJ. Alishan / "Nougak", five volumes, 18571858 / performed for the first time, was considered a series by M. Peshiktashlyan's ZeytunThe songs (1860s) were originally a series of poemsAv. Isahakyan's "Alagyaz Manes" / 1895-1917 /, which he later turned intoA poem created with poems.
 D. Varuzhan's "Song of Bread" is a lotI get closer to the genre of poems with poems.
 V. Teryan performed his famous poetic series.
  In connection with H. Tumanyan's famous quartets "the quartet as a lyrical poem"Linguist, literary critic S. Melkonyan tried to substantiate the hypothesis of considering it a literary type.
 E. Charents' "Tagaran" և etc., etc. was considered a poem with poems.
The series of poems has similarities with the poem with the poems, nevertheless they differ from each other.
 Both have a main, priority theme.
 But there are many in the poemsub-topics and discussions of different ideas can be presentedto come up with different lyrical heroes.
  Poem with poems, according to:is a series of poems, which is "printed in a certain sequence և united by a lyrical hero / whose image canto make changes in the course of a poem with poems /, in motive, theme, image ”[11].
  H. Shiraz is from the 1930sbegan to write poems dedicated to his parents, which he latersummarized in the above-mentioned collections, presenting the literary type with the sub-titles mentioned above.
The literaryization of the characters of the poet's parents, the lyrical, philosophical attitude and meaning, is the result of local thought and creative work.
  And here's the ideaDue to such consistency and interest, unique, original literary-artistic works have been created / especially among them.The book "Monument to my mother" stands out.
 Indeed, in world lyric poetry, as well as in the works of Armenian poets,We do not seem to encounter such an attempt to portray the images of our parents through poetic words and inspiration.
 This circumstance is relevantgave that literary critic S. Muradyan evaluate the above-mentioned works of H. Shiraz in the following way. The book "Monument to my mother", which the author named
a poem with woven poems, not only Armenian is unique in its kind,but in all world lyric poetry.
 Previous ones, including him!Av. Isahakyan, one or several poems were presented to the mother, while Hovh. Shiraz, continuing and developing their deposits, created
is a complete book of 174 poems, which is abundantwith real poetic inventions and lyrical wonders.
 The 4th volume of the collection of poems includes mother songsHe's poem "Monument to my father" woven with 109 poems.
Here, too, there are many good and the best, woven with poetryBoth poems deserve special consideration. "[8]
 We want to make it clear that these poems, which are unique in their kind, are vitalWhat kind of signals and promotion of literary patterns?were.
 Isn't it really world-renowned?In the interests of poets, the desire to comprehensively portray the lyrical characters of their parents is obvious.was not presented.
 Terry is universal in their worksand national, individual inner world, personal feelings, love, his freedom, individual և social environment, related to theminterest in other issues and the need to include them in the realm of poetry have become more pronounced.
 And all thatReflection on the images of the family home և parentshas remained in the background or has been expressed in relation to other artistic and thematic issues.
  What? more for us
It is easy to present the preconditions that could have contributed to ShirazIn poetry, he created the images of his own parents in the field of vision of a lyrical hero, which was a stimulus for his extensive discussion of the motives of motherhood and patriarchy in his lyric poetry.
Spontaneous poet who tends to delve deeper into lyrical self-expression in the motives of creating the images of his mother and fatherThe motives are conditioned by a number of factors.
  In our opinion, firstThe personal destiny of the poet played a roleIt was directly conditioned by the historical and political situation of its people and the circumstances created in the 1920s in the city of Alexandropol (later Leninakan, and now Gyumri) in the Shirak region.
  Already in 1915 The Armenian Genocide in Western Armenia
to the Turkish criminals committed in the 1920s. came to replace
Kemalized under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk)the massacres of the movement.
  They continue their blood relativesto carry out the current work in the territories of the First Republic of Armenia.
 The Turks who invaded Alexandropol killed the future poet's father, the farmer-gardener Tados, when his son was 5-6 years old.
Early childhood orphanage, at home with mother Astghik ույր sistersthe loss of a father, the unattractive environment of an American orphanage, the way of living with a homeless child stealing "one onion, one bread", the opportunity to finally be under his mother's protection, to live in the warmth of his family again,They were a place of deep feelings and reflections to createIn the soul of Hovhannes / Onik / endowed with natural talent, creativein the imagination.
In addition, the relationships and attitudes towards family members, particularly parents, are exceptionally strongA tradition has been formed for the historical existence of our people and the Armenian peoplein individual consciousness.
 The family was understood as the basis for the coexistence of relatives, society and the existence of the nation.
 Parents' love, care, maturity, children for themThe atmosphere of reverence is a special warmth and intimacycreates among them.
 The attitude towards the mother is exceptional,which, being formed in childhood, continues throughout the child's lifeduring which time they reached the level of worship.
 The image of a mother, humantraits, the most delicate and tender attitude of a womanexpressed in eggs, as in the biological nutrition of the childby satisfying the demands, by protecting him physically and morally from unfavorable domestic and vital circumstances;It has a special meaning for the latter.
 And all this,Naturally, H. Shiraz interests, world knowledge,
Less than the scope of literary and artistic works!They could not be left out or bypassed.
When entering literary life, since the 1930sin lyric poetry begins with the mother-themed worldthrough his fictional verse about man and homelandemotions, confession-meditation and philosophicalthe young poet's preference for expressing his thoughts.
Shiraz lyric written on the motives of motherhoodAmong the works were "Monument to my mother" և "MonumentPoems woven with poems "My father".
The source of their idea, of course, is the human and poetic temperament of the author, the feelings of love, humility and respect for the parents.
 By revealing the moral and psychological essence of their characters, the poet has reached mandepicting the diverse and multicolored manifestations of the human being,about his national and universal description of his social andthe goal of expressing և embodying the aesthetic ideal.
In our opinion, the characters of Shiraz's parents and future poet son in Shiraz's poetry have archetypal lines that are related tohave the characteristics of mother, father, child archetypal prototypesto the extent that through them the poet expresses his cherished,The universal feelings and ideas about preserving the human in a human being.
 Besides, in his lyric poetryThe mother, as if bearing the features of her mother's archetypal prototype, symbolizes the rebirth of life and the eternal cycle.
  The father is an archetypal prototype.
 "My father is a powerful archetype,- that lives in the soul of a child, - writes the modern psychologist.
 - The father's archetype is a generalized image of all the fathers of the past, to some extentrepresents a person's attitude towards a man, law, state,to reason.
  And before that it could be the Father's archetypeIncarnate of God, power, struggle, all natural forcesan image that is ready to help or harm. ”[12]
 The above descriptionWe see many of the features of the poet's parentsin artistic characters.
It can be said that "Monument to my mother" և "Monument to my father"Shiraz with the books of the time - Soviet Armenian reality and literatureIn the process of searching for literary characters with a positive description, he achieved his aesthetic goal as his parents, aslyrical hero's relationships, revelations of հոր father's human virtues, son's attitude towards themby self-expression and meaning.
  Archetypal lines in themThe fact of seeing testifies to the fact that the poet mentioned aboveattributes to the parents something observed in the new generationunacceptable attitude or human morality in generalto oppose people who have departed from high values.
The literary type of poems with poems assumes that the poems posted here are "self-finished lyrical"are closely related to each other in the presence of lyrical characters composed of poetic words, whichThe human essence is revealed by the poetic son's lyrical-philosophical confessions.
  In both books, both the poetic-lyrical hero and the characters of his parents were created by the artistic application of some basic features of the lyrical poem and poem genre.
 In general, they are characterized by the pathos, solemnity, high style expressed in the originality of the Shiraz poetic word, but in such a mixture of speech the vital and everyday life is intertwined.
 Such an approachThanks to both, the author has created his relatives and hisas a lyrical hero with a positive description, to some extentidealized literary characters.
 They introduce themselves to the readerboth in everyday life and in the sphere of raising the moral description of an individual, issues of national and universal resonance.
"Monument to my mother" consists of "Prelude", two chapters ևFrom "The End Song".
  Love, respect for the idealized image of the mother, her kindness, care and devotion to her sonThe poet initiated the moral basis of this work from the starting points.// I must open your mother's heart to you: // Like such dark, treacherous men, // I will owe all my prodigal sons // All the lost, all the lost mothers… [10].
The poet uses the genre opportunities of the ballad,uses the legend's fantastic conventionality with his sonTo show the power of motherly love and the power of influence.// They say, as if on a bonfire // They burned the heart of a young rebel. //Say
allegedly, the ashes were taken out of his // Bonfire and taken to his mother, // his mother criedon the ashes, // And when the tears fell on the ashes: // He came to lifehis son… / "Ballad-poem" /.
The mother is an earthly goddess because she is weightless and immeasurablethe kindness and love of the soul for the son, followed by each personIn order to preserve the human in him, he needs to become at least his motherobject of worship. // Now I say, you atheists, // Accept your mother, the mother goddess, // Young or old, the only saint, // Me and you
A handful of mother goddesses.
 / "Message-National Guard" /.
 More and more, they express themselves through new artistic and literary trickscreating the poet's emotions and praise, the radiance and lava emanating from the soul,Poetic diamonds, one of which is "My Mother".
  Orphaned by his father, who meets the basic needs of family membersthe needs of children in ways that seem possible and impossibleThe poet presents the providing mother by comparing the existence of the Armenian man with the big and small phenomena of the spiritual-moral world.
 A monumental mother is created with original poetic comparisonsthe image.
  // My mother is the door of our hope, // My mother is the chapel of our house //, // OursMy mother is the cradle, // My mother is the castle of our house, // Our father and ours is my mother, // OurMy mother is the servant and the master, // My mother is the splendor of our house, // My mother is our splendor,// My mother, our mother is our bread, // My mother is the god of our house… The poet presents the mother mostly with her moral image, with the thought and advice given to her son, with wise generalizations about life, world position, human relations.
  Poems with a common theme with the genre of the poem ևregarding Shiraz with his aesthetic and moral ideasreinterprets the meaning of the image of the mother for the son in episodic situations and in the realm of one poemself-expression.
 Due to the use of such a literary invention, the general theme of the genre "poem with woven poems" is enriched with poems written with various sub-themes.
 In them with artistic perfection and lifeThe lyrical meaning of the orphans' worldviews and life, mental feelings and emotions born of longing for the mother are distinguished.original manifestations and growing up in her life under the auspices of her motherdream expressions.
  And the topic of depicting an orphan childHe accompanied the world literature, appearing in different genres.
  It included "social injustices"!Condemnation of the war and the genocide, because they were followed by the orphans, the expressions of the orphans' mental anguish, and the heartbreaking desire to be under the protection of the parents.
  Think of a verse in the realm of fictionThe discussion was best expressed in Shiraz under the title "Gta"in the poem.
 It is impossible to read where without getting excitedThe above topics, the images of the orphan child and his mother are depictedwith impeccable artistic performance, which makes it more lyricaland the influence of this work created by the interweaving of epic elements.
The boy who left the orphanage because he missed his mother tries to steal a stranger in the marketThe bread in the woman's hand, but it turns out that she is the mother of the boy who became a mobis.
 And the impressive thing is that the author expresses the boundless joy of his little hero to the ideas of a hungry orphan child.in the amount of // He madly cherishes, cherishes, // And stung my soul, // And it seems
or in the market // How much bread was there, they gave it to me.// But he also forgot the bread: // Stillhe was squeezing me on the chest, // Ah, he was my lost mother, // he took his lost sonHouse…The author, who has grown up, matured, and become a well-known poet, introduces the mother in a new relationship, who, being concerned about her son's safety, envies the envious and evil people of the environment.He also gives useful advice on how to express an attitude towards him, seasoned with irony, imbued with life experience. // People
They are very timid, // Always be sweet with your back, // So that your door does not knock // Nocloud, no sorrow.
// One enemy is many, yes, // Seven hundred from a friend, // My son,just believe me, // Always cover your tongue with a sword.
 / "My mother's persuasions" /.
The poet considers the image of the mother in the field of the relationship between the son and the bride.
 And again he makes profound generalizations, where the motherly behavior is beneficial.// The woman's heart was a crystal glass, // I crushed it and I can't paste it. // And from that day, alas, he can not
// Take the wine of my kisses wholeheartedly.
  // What miracle heart is in the heart?maternal, // No matter how much the son is mad, // Not a moment passed, not passeda second of grief // She always clings and has fun with her son.
 By honoring his mother, the poet reveals the moral aspects and merits typical of mothers in general.
 And in order to make the image of the mother in the poem written with poems more personalized and original, the poet presents her particularly modestly,compared to other mothers.
 Such prudenceBringing it, Shiraz writes: // My mother would say, praise me, // Every mother is a mother
always, // Do not criticize others, // There is no wicked mother //.
Nevertheless, the poet gradually unites the image idealized by the visible image of the mother with the ideas of mother Armenia, the perpetuation of the Armenian language that keeps Armenians Armenian.
  Such:Due to the embodiment, the image of Shiraz's mother includes a number of sub-layers of a complex mother-land archetype.
Thus enriching the lyrical and human content of the image of the mother, the author in the second chapter, in the "Last Chapter", with a new whirlwindpresents the waves of poetic feelings and thoughts that pervaded her after her mother's death.
  / Such a structure inadvertently remindsPetrarca's "Book of Songs", in which some of the songs are writtenDuring Laura's lifetime, and the second part after her death //.
 ShirazWhile creating this book, he had already mastered the experience of national and world literature, wrote a unique and original one with its own theme.Poems with two poems.
  They are works that complete the poet's motherhood and patriarchy.
The image of a mother created with lyrical means in the second chapter's essence, the poet relates to the size of the universe to express the magnitude of her death, the grief of loss.// Passerby, humble // Your headseg, // Here rests // A handful of space //.
 The loss of the mother to the poetpushes to present its essence and significance from new sidesfor son // You healed my soul with a prayer, // You saved a thousand and one evils
from the eye, // You were the mortar of God և man, // You drove away my pain and conspiraciesfrom life //.
  It is a harmony of poetic horse and content/ "Morse Tomb" / the title line.
 The greatness of the image of the mother created by the poet is felt by the mother nature.
  His tombstone is created with the participation of God and the angel, with special care andgently. // Snow falls and accumulates // Above my mother, // Like a feather
falls from the angel's wings.
//… // puts it so gently // God flakeflake, // That it does not hurt for the rest of my life // My mother's sore heart is old.
Even after her mother's death, her image and image continueto accompany his son, whether he wakes up or dreams.
 The son continues to feel the need to communicate with him, because he has lost a wise counselor,From the endless hand that cares for its children, from the watchful eye and the tender heart.
  And here is a dream mother who is being temptedson, examines his human nature, the foundations of moral existenceThe strength that he had instilled in him as a child, that is, the ability to be compassionate to people, to help the poor, the needy, the orphan unselfishly.
// I was scared, but I fell in my arms, // My mother said. "I am, I am, // to test you
I came for: // Hasn't it changed your life?
  // I came in the form of a beggar, // Which?God knows, // Is the place your conscience, your conscience, my son, // Or did he die with me… » / "Miracle of spirituality" /.
 In this book, the image of the mother, of course, often appears in parallel with the image of the father, as creators and guardians of the poet's life.
 The literary part of the second part of this poem is the sameThe father of the author appears from the grave.
 The image of the latterThrough the writer, he presents the issue of preserving his national identity, reviving the topic of the liberation of the lost homeland, Masis-Western Armenia, ordering the liberation of the largest part of the captive Armenian world. // But when he looked at Ararat, // he looked at me intently
My father is old, // - What else are you my son, // When our house is half empty… // Out of griefMy father died again, // My son said if you wanted // Let the earth be light on me, // My housedo not leave half ատ //.
The images of both mother and father in the field of the poet's thoughts, feelings, feelings are finally elevated և generalize to the motherland, Armenianlanguage, intertwined with the fate of the people.
 Therefore, the message of the dead mother is impressive and profound. // See, my soul will rise, // Death to my body
death is pure, // Your mother will die at that hour, // When your mother tongue dies.
// I will die,when suddenly // Mother Araks dries up, // When Masis worships you too // It changesgorge and land //.
The book "Monument to my father" was published with great delay by the poetDecades after his death in 2017. [9]
 It is structuralcontinues the idea born of the book "Monument to my mother".
  Here, the author has created the image of his father with poems that have a common theme, but he is also independent with his poems, episodic imagery and lyrical self-expression.
 How և:In the previous book he used the canon of classical lyrical poetryyours.
  The image of the father in the realm of the poet's lyrical feelingsHe is characterized by both a real and an idealized description of a person who is constantly interested in the fate of his homeland, his great devotion to his human family, diligence, and diligence.
 The image of the father, like the image of the mother, emerges in the texture of the poet's feelings, emotions and thoughts in the text depicted with the artistic shades and sculptures of the artistic verse.
 Maybe this book's contentin terms of the number of highly valuable works of artIt is a little behind the previous one, but there is a unique theme hereand impressive illustrations.
 His "dull peasant" fatherHe wanted to present the individual and the Armenian person with such generalized character and interests, where combinedConcerns were expressed about family members as well as national issues and the preservation of universal moral values.
First of all, the poet recreates the image of the father in childhoodin the memories of that period, because he had seen his father in that period.
 His imageThe poet first means as the guardian, the sponsor of their family and home.
  The presence of the father is a guarantee for the child to enjoy the security of the family, harmonious coexistence, the beauty of life and the benefits of life. // My father would come like the winds of Shirak
evening, // Shining shovel on the shoulder, like the moon rising from the mountain, // My father will come,I will remember like a dream yesterday, // It was as if the world was entering through the door of our hutInside… // You would smell all the Shirak melons, // Shiny shovel on the shoulder:like the golden hope of our house, // And he would carry me on his shoulders, and ringing in the hut, // MyIt was flying, Dad, will you take me to the vegetable garden?
  / "My father's return" /.
Remember in the poet's inner world, orphan because of a dead relativeThe image of the father is constantly presented in the field of dreams and longings of a young man who had a childhood.
 It stays in his soul foreverThe feeling of filial love for the memory of the murdered parent.// What a prodigal son I am, // That the grave is unfortunate for my father // Lost a bottomless treasureLike // And I do not find it until today!
// But when the wind blows from the field and the valley // Shovel and waterHe brings a voice: // It seems to me that he is my father again // He waters the melons in the dark.
/ "Illusion" /.
The murder of his father at an early age disrupted the normal life of the consecrated family, and later, in the soul of the mature poet son, gave birth to retrospective emotions.to be deprived of the opportunity of filial gratitude and reparationfeeling of pain. // I owe you, my father, I owe you, // My father, I owe you
I stayed, // They did not let you breathe one day // The scent earned your son.
  / “Permanent speakerthe debt of the son "/.
The author expands on the father as a collective image of the Armenian peasantryfield of interest, including concern for the fate of the lost Western Armenia, a large area of ​​the homelandThe popular message and dream of liberating the captive part.
The poet finally weaves a wise old man in the image of his fatherArchetypal traits that enrich his human nature, convey the wisdom of living with humanistic views and way of lifewith the temperament of a consultant.
 Such an idea arises in JesusThanks to the comparisons with Christ, the Armenian King Ashot the Merciful.
 The poet saw in such a character the expressions of his moral and vital ideals, cherished ideas.
  // It seems that Ashot was the Merciful King in my father, // Because he was a breadwinnersits with the "back" poor, // If it were a leper, whatever it was, bring it, orderHe always had to: // My father was Jesus himself when he entered the crowd // "My father, Sharan's many songs" /.
  And so, the archetype of Jesus, the Wise Old ManThrough the literary image of his father, which is characteristic of his ideas, the poetic-lyrical hero expresses his cherished ideas, national and universal aspirations and ideals about eliminating evil and cruelty in life, establishing harmony in the country through work.
  And they closelyThey were related to the father of living a just and honest life, doing good to peoplein desires and commandments.
 Expressing his ideas from the point of view of his father's worldviews, the author writesIt is the message of creating crops and goods through work, even teaching the enemy lessons of humanity through his work.
  But oursMost of the homeland (almost one tenth) was occupied by the Turks in the pastIn order not to disturb the invaders, the poet's one of his main tasksHe considered the idea of ​​taking revenge on our people through the image of the father to take revenge on the age-old enemy, to bring back what was lost.
 He condemned the world indifferent to our people who went through the Great Genocide.
 The only support for the Armenian self-preservation finally saw itselfto solve the problem of unity and consolidation of the internal forces of the peoplein.
  A patriot living and creating with pan-Armenian concernsThe poet did not abandon the liberation of Western Armeniadeep faith.
 Hence, "Father's silent monologue with the fate of his nation"in both he writes: // But this origin of a witness: // Witness light Shana: // District
The vampire must be liberated // The sea will be liberated in Van.
H. Shiraz, however, presents the image of his father in a certain way in the context of him and his birthplace, the city of Gyumri, its surroundings, the nature of Shirak, the beauty of the gardens cultivated by his father.
 Or does the poet's mind continue to be under Turkish rule?In other areas of the historical homeland of the cities of Ani, Kars and VanAt least to remind the reader of the sacred geographical names of the lost homeland.
 But so is he at the same timeHe acted as a claimant of his occupied country1.
In this book, the life and destiny of the father killed by the Turks becomes a model for Shiraz for the destiny of the homeland.
 His death,It was with the pain of loss that the poet directly felt the depth of grief caused to the Armenian man by the Armenian Genocide.
  And because of his literatureThis type of poem is a poem with poems, Shiraz has preserved in it such features of the poem as solemnity and pathos.
 Here is such a fictionWithin the framework of the depiction, he recreated the character and actions created by his father's trustworthy and creative imagination.
 In the image of Bostanch, a night owl father, the poet saw the lines of a brave Armenian, Hayduk-Fida.
 With this approach he enriched his father's description by presenting him as a "wise, humane, patriotic and brave person."
 In the poem depicting the episode of his murder / "My father's last murmur" / the author writes: // - In the garden of your garden // You hid Hayduk… // - Take you, Hayduk vampire… // - You too
You killed a Turk…1 Note here that this book by Shiraz, like many of his other works, such as “Hayots"Danteyan", "Karabakh mourning", etc., were not published in his homeland during the Soviet years, because the censorship of the time did not allow to publish the Mountainous Armenia of Western Armenia occupied by Turkey and Soviet AzerbaijanThe works of the poet's alleged claimant to the Karabakh Autonomous Region (NKAO), condemning the historical injustice and defending the interests of the Armenian people.
The idea of ​​revenge for the death of his father in the Armenian massacresShiraz does not leave in the thematic-ideological discussions of the "Last Chapter" of the song.
 To express the idea of ​​revenge for his father's murder by a gang of Turks, he chooses the protagonist of W. Shakespeare's "Hamlet" from the world-famous literary prototype, through the ghost of the king's father, who was assassinated by a conspiracy.The episode of telling the message of revenge to his prince son.
 H. ShirazThe lyrical hero was, in fact, inspired by the avenger of his father's deathThe example of Hamlet.
  So he was tortured to death by his fatherDepicting the scene, the Armenian poet writes: // They beat me, tore my tongue
from the mouth, // He was muttering speechless, // I was afraid of a bloody, silent voice,// My son, take revenge on your father… / "The roaring silence of my father" /.
 In taking revenge on the enemy, the poet considers his situation worse than himselfHe feels responsible not only for his father, but also for a million and a half Western Armeniansfor the victims.
  It was already intolerable that in 1915 Armenian Great
The Young Turk authorities who carried out the genocide were not retroactively condemned, and even the works of the poet who rebelled against the genocide and genocides during the Soviet years.They did not even publish it.
 // Hamlet was muttering to a father, // My father, how am I?do not scream, // When a whole highland calls me, - // Until they let at leastI roar with a song //.
 With its shape and content, this is one of the best stripes in the book.
 In relatively short lines (11.7 syllables) the author has constructively and purposefully constructed his thought և to finish it.
Thus, H. Shiraz's motherhood and patriarchy are topicsThey enriched those sections of Armenian lyric poetry with unique touches.
The artistic achievements of the poet's poems "Monument to my mother" and "Monument to my father" can arouse interesting interest when drawing parallels with lyrical works on the same themes in the world of lyric poetry.
 Especially, as it has already been noticed, the poems with the above-mentioned poems can even occupy a special place next to the verse poets of the world, dedicated to their parents.
H. Shiraz, subjected to the above-mentioned literary analysisIn his works, he pursued a moral goal through the idea of ​​parenthood, while at the same time giving patriotism lessons to his readers.
 Their ideological influence continues todayIt must be felt.
