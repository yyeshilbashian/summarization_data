THE WORD "FLOWER" AND THE COMPARATIVE EXAMINATION OF ITS SYMBOLIC MEANINGS IN SPANISH AND ARMENIAN In modern linguistics a great place is given to the semantic examination of word units.
 There are many works dedicated to the semantic study of flower names, but the mentioned field has not been sufficiently studied yet, its study is considered topical.
  It should be noted that for the first time an attempt is made to combine the semantic spheres of the concept of "flower" in Spanish և in Armenian, from which the observation of the concept of "flower" as a national-cultural component comes from.
 Here we must take into account the fact that in each culture it can present itself in a different way, have its symbolic role, which may not exist outside the given culture.
It is known that flowers have been considered very influential and expressive symbols in all cultures.
 From time immemorial, flowers have been the most common means of conveying emotions.
  The roots of the language of flowers still come from the East, passed down from generation to generation, from culture to culture, which received the name "selam".
 According to Selam, each flower իր scented its symbolic value.
In any language, any concept is expressed in words.
  According to E. According to Aghayan, every word that expresses a concept has a nominative role, which is conditioned by the fact that the word's egg, attaching to this or that concept, names many identical objects united by that concept or whole classes of their types, genders, etc. or each subject separately.
  Thus, for example, the word tree in its concept unites all kinds of trees indiscriminately 1.
In the case of flora appointments, as noted by G. Jahukyan, there are collective concepts, in which case there are symbolic-non-symbolic (real) collective nouns.
 Thus, the word tree is collective, on a symbolic level, meaning both trees in general and each individual tree2.
Following the same example, we can refer to the word "flower", which can be "collective" and can include all the flowers separately.
  It should be noted that here it is necessary to consider the semantic manifestations of the word §Í³ÕÇÏ¦ in the form of semantic fields 1 See Aghayan E., Fundamentals of Linguistics, Yerevan, 1987, p. 358.
2 See Jahukyan G., Semantics of the modern Armenian language և word formation, Yerevan, 1989, p. 134.
from the point of view of
 The semantic fields of the words should be studied and interpreted both in Spanish and Armenology.
  The Spanish linguist Caretter bases his theory of semantic fields on the ideology of ima.
  According to Caretter, the semantic field is a group of words that express the same semantic content in such a way that each of the words is opposed to the others by its characteristic semantic distinct lines, each of these distinctive lines he calls imak 1.
The semantic field of flowers can include the names of different flowers, such as amapola, rosa, margarita in Spanish, etc., and in Armenian, rose, clove, violet, poppy, lily of the valley, forget-me-not, daisy, lily, snowdrop, etc.
 As we have already mentioned, semantic fields are the groups of words that can be united in the same sense, belonging to the same conceptual field.
  And in the above-mentioned words, rose, poppy, violet fill the semantic field of the conceptual field "flower".
Flower names, as linguistic units, express concepts in both Spanish and Armenian.
 When talking about the symbols of flowers, it is necessary to single out the flower names that are used in certain structures, phrases և can express quality, feeling or condition.
For example, the phrase "ponerse como amapola" (literally translated as "poppy" in Armenian), which means to blush with shame, can indicate a condition (for example, When the girl advised that she was introverted because the cabbage ducks were terrified, they could like an amapola) 2:
 The phrase "quedar colorado como una rosa (las propias rosas)" can have the same meaning.
In Armenian we have to become a rose equivalent to the mentioned phrase, to cut the phrases.
 It should be noted that in Spanish the same meaning is expressed by the names of two flowers: (rosa) rose և (amapola) poppy, while in Armenian we have the equivalent version, expressed through a single rose flower.
Below we present a number of structures that can show condition through flower names. 1. The phrase "criar margaritas", expressed through the pearl flower, which means to be dead (Los cantantes preferidos del abuelo están yatodos criando margaritas y nadie se acuerda de ellos) 3.
2. The phrase "estar una cosa como la rosa en el rosal", expressed through a rose, which in Armenian means to be appropriate, to be relevant.
3. The phrase “sentirse / estar / encontrarse como las propias rosas” translates to feel good.
4. The phrase "ver rosas y jazmínes donde no hay más que cardos y ortigas" means to be optimistic, including rose և jasmine flower 1 See Saroyan L., on the problem of semantic fields of words expressing the meaning of time, "Foreign languages ​​in high school" , Yerevan, 2004, pp. 131-140.
3 In the same place.
the names.
  Equivalent to this phrase is the phrase "ver elmundo de color de rosa", in the core of which is not the rose flower, but the color of the flower.
 And in Armenian there is no flower component at all - to look at the world with pink glasses.
During the research we have singled out a number of phrases expressed by flower names, which, as we have already mentioned, express quality, such as 5. The phrase "como las rosas de abril / de mayo" means beautiful, flourishing և is used to describe the beauty of women.
  In Armenian it can be equivalent to a rose-like / rose-like phrase, which means good, good, calm, prosperous.
6. The phrase "como rosa de invierno" has two slightly contradictory meanings. In the first sense, it means superficial, and in the second sense, it means fragile, delicate.
Among the expressions expressing emotion in the name of the rose flower, we can mention the following: "olerle / saberle a rosas una cosa a uno", which means to like too much.
As we have already mentioned, flowers are considered the natural manifestations of nature.
  They can present different qualities and qualities of human values ​​in different cultures.
 Each flower has its meaning, առանձին each individual flower differs according to the horse, size, place, culture, human perception and imagination.
It should be noted that the same flower name symbolizes different phenomena, such as carnation can symbolize "love," touch, "joy", "passion".
  Conversely, a number of flowers may have the same symbol, such as carnation, calendula, rose, forget-me-not, orchid flowers symbolize love in different cultures.
The significance of flowers can usually be considered as a distinguishing feature in culture, as an indicator of a national cultural component.
  For example, the rose was considered a symbol of love in the East, and in Greece - a symbol of eternal passion, while in Spain the carnation is considered a symbol of passion.
  Anyuta's eyes flower was considered the flower of the Holy Trinity in the ancient Middle Ages, because Christians saw a triangle on the dark line inside it, comparing it with the Holy Trinity.
If we try to find out the nominal differences of flowers by place, horse or size, then most of them can be clarified by etymological analysis.
  We have tried to differentiate according to the cultural factor, taking into account the fact that many flower names are borrowed, revealing their names requires a lot of etymological work.
  It should be noted that many names have specific semantic elements.
 Thus, for example, the Armenian "poppy" (poppy, "pop", poppy, tulip), in Spanish "amapola" (habapaura, papaver, al-habba, grano, semilla), symbolizes dream and death.
 According to one legend, tulips were born from the blood of soldiers killed in war.
 Probably this is the reason why the poppy can be a symbol of dreams, dreams and death at the same time.
 In Armenian sources, the poppy is a symbol of forgetfulness and constant sleep, the red poppy is a symbol of satisfaction, and the yellow is a symbol of wealth and success.
"Mekhak" (borrowed from "Mexak"), in Spanish "Clavel" (Cat. Clavell (clavo de clavar), cat. Clavell (flor del clavel), cast. Clavel (flor del clavel), usually combined with joy, with the touch, the charm, from which love and pleasure come.
Clove is the most popular flower in Spanish culture շարունակ the most demanded flower for many years.
 In Spain there are different types of clove clavelina և clavel, the most essential of which is the color.
For example, a person with a red carnation can express his admiration, and with a white carnation - sincere love.
"Nomelovides" (Spanish: "Nomelovides").
 According to a legend, a young man drowns in the river while harvesting for his beloved, բառերը the words "Do not forget me" sound like a sigh.
 It should be noted that the equivalent of forget-me-not in Spanish is "No me olvides", the translation of which is the same as "Do not forget me".
 Forgetfulness is a symbol of despairing love.
 In Armenian sources, forget-me-not is mentioned as a symbol of silent longing, secret longing and sincerity, as a symbol of memory, real love and loyalty.
"Vard" (pronounced "Vard", Spanish: "Rosa") has the same meaning in almost any culture: purity, perfection, earthly love, rebirth.
 In ancient times, the red rose was an indicator of love and beauty.
 The white rose is considered a flower of the moon or light և symbolizes purity, prudence և charm.
 The yellow rose is usually associated with jealousy's unfaithfulness, or it may not be the information they want to convey.
"Girasol" (Spanish: "Girasol") symbolizes passion and love, and in Armenian culture - pride - at the same time meekness.
The "pearl flower" (Spanish: "Margarita") symbolizes innocence, purity, earthly and heavenly whole.
  It is a flower of joy.
In Armenian culture, the pearl is the herald of spring and Easter; the mystery of resurrection's resurrection is contained in it.
"Snowdrop" (Spanish: "Campanilla de invierno") in Armenian culture symbolizes hope, tenderness and youth.
  It is considered a harbinger of spring.
  It is also a symbol of hope in European countries.
  April 19 is considered a snowdrop day.
The "orchid" (Spanish: "Orquídea") symbolizes beauty and sweetness, love and delicacy.
  In China this flower is considered a symbol of perfection, and in England it symbolizes the blood of Christ.
The "lily" ("Azucena") is considered a symbol of purity and perfection, as well as peace and innocence.
There are a number of flowers in Armenian, the equivalents of which do not stand out in Spanish due to the effectiveness of their symbolic meanings.
  Such flowers are, for example, the bellflower, which is a symbol of harmony, obedience and steadfastness, the lilac, which is a symbol of beauty, delicacy, rich inner world and help, the lily, which, being exclusively an Armenian flower, always includes the desire to always move forward. which is distinguished by the variety of its symbolic meanings.
  According to Greek mythology, a goddess who tried to escape from Apollo turned into a violet, symbolizing dignity and modesty.
  It has the symbol of fertility, kindness, youth and peace.

By depicting the semantic fields of the symbols of the concept of "flower", we have highlighted the distinctive features that can appear as a national-cultural factor.
  In this case, the fact is taken into account that depending on the culture, the flower, as a natural phenomenon, presents different qualities of human values ​​(see table).
 In the table we have presented the results of the study of Armenian and Spanish at the same time.
 Thus, the notion of "flower", dividing it according to its features, taking into account the cultural factor, we can say that in the semantic fields of that notion there are such symbols that can be typical of many flowers, but not all of them.
  In our work we have singled out "love" as such, which is common to carnations, forget-me-nots, roses, flowers and orchids.
  As we have already mentioned, the same flower can be a creed symbol in the culture of one country and have a negative meaning in another.
 If we try to analyze the words "girasol" la "girasol" (la flor de sol) etymologically, then in both Armenian and Spanish it will be considered an ari flower, but it will not have the same symbol. In Spanish culture it means passion and love, and in Armenian culture it means pride.
  Let us present another example. In Armenian "forgetful", and in Spanish - "nomelovides" flower has the same meaning in both languages, but is distinguished by different symbols - in Armenian - silent longing, sincerity, and in Spanish - despairing love.
From the study we can deduce that flowers have a special place in "Spanish culture" and "Armenian culture".
  We can conclude that the rose (rosa) flower is considered the most beautiful in both cultures, the queen of all flowers, and the lily (azucena) is considered immaculate, white and innocent.
  The pearl is considered a precious thing in Spanish culture, and in Armenian explanatory dictionaries it is not given the meaning that in the Armenian translation of the Bible it is mentioned as a precious thing.
No matter how widespread the poppy, carnation-flower flowers are in the Armenian highlands, their explanations are not presented in these Armenian explanatory dictionaries, instead they are found in Spanish sources with their unique meanings.
  E. In Aghayan's explanatory dictionary we came across the flower name "unforgettable", which is characterized by the expressions "unforgettable", "always worth remembering".
Thus, in conclusion, we can say that the same flower name can express the same symbolic meaning in Armenian and Spanish.
 More often, however, they can differ, which stems from the peculiarities of the languages ​​being studied, the linguistic and cultural differences, and the worldview of the people who speak that language.
