1918-1920 Georgia was no exception among the neighboring countries of the Republic of Armenia in terms of claiming historical Armenian territories.
 Taking advantage of the difficult military-political situation created for Armenia, Georgia tried at all costs to take possession of the historical Armenian Lori "Javakhk Territories" populated mainly by Armenians, and finally managed to annex some of them to Georgia.
Armenian-Georgian 1918-1921 Quite extensive literature has been created on relations (including territorial issues) (Melkonyan A., Javakhk in the 19th century առաջին in the first quarter of the 20th century, Yerevan 2003, Sardaryan K., Armenian-Georgian relations in 1918-21, Yerevan, 2002, Virabyan V. The Georgian-Armenian war, the military-political activity of the Government of the Republic of Armenia (parties, Yerevan, 2003, etc.), but even today the comprehensive coverage of the topic has a modern scientific significance.
Georgian historiography and the press do not always give an objective assessment of the events that took place at the beginning of the century.
  Guram Markhulia (Guram Markhuliya, "Betrayal of Armenians in the Roofs", "iberiana.Gruzia", ​​kavkasia.net/Armenia/article/1324960915.php) stands out with its Irhaka-Armenian publications.
  Meanwhile, the discovery of the historical truth is not only a scientific necessity, but is aimed at preserving and strengthening the Armenian-Georgian neighborly relations.
 In this respect, the topic is topical.
The urgency of the article is conditioned by the fact that both Georgian-Azerbaijani and Armenian-Georgian border adjustments are taking place at present.
  In such cases, controversial questions arise about this or that part of the border.
 A striking example of this is what happened in the Bavra sector, when 300 hectares of agricultural land in Armenia were attributed to Georgia, hindering the implementation of agricultural activities.
  There are debatable issues in the parts of Aghkyorpi և Khojorni, which are mainly conditioned by the border crossing with a forest layer.
Our goal is to once again clarify the area that became the subject of controversy between centuries-old settlers in the early 20th century.
The study of the issue was carried out by the method of comparative examination of historical sources, comparison of facts, generalizations.
  The conclusions put forward are based on the evidence of the sources.
Disputed territories between Armenians and Georgians were the province of Akhalkalaki (historical Gugark province of the world Gugark) along with the adjacent Tsalka region (historical Gugark world of Tregk province), the southern part of the Khram River south of the Borchalu province of Tbilissi (southern part of the historical Gugark province).
 The latter corresponded to the Yekaterinenfeld and Lori police stations in Borchalu province at the beginning of the 20th century, to the section south of the Khram River at the Trialett police station.
 The southwestern Armenian part of Ghazakh province was also disputed.
 There was such a national proportion in the mentioned disputed area: 260 thousand Armenians, 7 thousand Georgians և 30 thousand other nations1.

The issue of the administrative re-establishment of Transcaucasia on a national principle arose before the revolution.
  It was discussed at the 1909 և 1916 consultations.
 According to the Armenian project, the territorial division according to the national principle allocated a proportional amount of land to each nation.
  According to the Armenian National Council of Baku in 1918 According to a document drawn up in December 191, if we take the total number of Armenians, Georgians and Muslims in the Transcaucasia, it should be deduced that Georgians make up 28%, Armenians - 29%, and Muslims - 43%.
  According to the Armenian project, respectively, 29% of the territory should have passed to the Armenians, 30-33% to the Georgians, and 38-41% to the Tatars.
 The Armenian project was based on a fair principle, the Armenian Democrats assumed that justice would prevail after the revolution.
After the February revolution, the three main nations of the Transcaucasus, declaring themselves the owners of the territory, decided to resolve the territorial issue on a national basis.
 This principle was the basis of many governmental and public interethnic consultations, and was approved by all the ruling parties.
 Both the Social-Democratic Mensheviks and the Georgian National-Federalists believed that the demarcation of the borders should be based on the real distribution of this or that nation.
 According to the Georgian Socialist-Federalists, "the following provinces should be included in the territory of Georgia, including the province of Tbilissi (Georgia): Tbilissi (Tbilisi), Gori, Dusheti, Telavi, Sghnakh, Tionet, Borchalu, Akhalkalaki, Akhaltsikhe, Akhaltsikhe part of the district.
 As for the Borchalu և Zakatala regions, they will become part of Georgia if the majority of the population wants it through a referendum. ”2
 1917 In the summer of 2006, a meeting of the Transcaucasian Ministry of the Interior, attended by representatives of the Transcaucasus, also decided to change the administrative structure of the region on a national basis.
  For this purpose, a commission is set up headed by Senator, Professor of State Law Prince Zurab Avalov.
  In the protocol of the commission we read: "Commission members Shahkhatunyants և Khatisyan suggest removing the Lori police station from the Borchalu province, the rural communities of the adjacent Borchalu չ Yekaterinenfeld precincts, which have a widespread Armenian population.
  On the same principle, from the Trialeti precinct to the province of Akhalkalaki, to connect it to Ashghali 1 Ibid., P. 68.

 To take the province of Akhalkalaki out of the province of Tbilissi ”4.
 It is mentioned by the members of the commission that it is expedient to cross the border through Khramget.
Following minor changes, the Ministry of the Interior referred it to the Transcaucasian Special Steering Committee, which convened a meeting (15 members, 5 from each nation, chaired by New Jordan) to approve the draft on a national basis.
 Only the National Democrats are against the withdrawal of the provinces of Borchalu and Akhalkalaki from the territory of Georgia5.
 It must be said that even then the issue of borders was at the level of state-territorial, not just administrative divisions.
 After the proclamation of the Transcaucasian Democratic Federal Republic, when the issue of border revision is raised again, it is already clearer that we are talking about the borders of the three Transcaucasian republics, which would be connected by a federal principle.
Prior to the declaration of independence, the Georgian National Council agreed on a national basis to see about 2/3 of the province of Borchalu, the entire province of Akhalkalaki, as part of Armenia6.
  And in June 1918, during official talks with Armenian ministers, Jordan stated that Georgia had no ambitions for Lori.
 Thus, the setback is one. The ownership of the disputed territories to Armenia, the Armenian people, has been accepted by the Georgian national and political circles.
  But soon the situation changes dramatically.
1918 According to the Treaty of Batumi of June 4, 1945, Akhalkalaki was transferred to the Ottoman Empire.
  Lori (Borchalu province) and Pambak (Alexandropol province), east of the border established by the Batumi Treaty, remain demobilized by German-Turkish troops.

At the same time (June 6) in the official Caucasus newspaper, the Georgian government states that the delimitation and demarcation of the borders between Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan is the sole responsibility of these countries, and that the Georgian government can hold direct talks on these issues with Armenia. and Azerbaijan without Turkish intervention.
 At the same time, it is stated that an agreement on territorial issues, if such is to be signed between Turkey and Armenia, cannot be binding on Georgia1.
  On June 11, the Georgian government decided to set up a commission to clarify the borders.
 The commission protects Georgia's "economic, strategic" borders, including Armenian territories up to Lake Sanaa.
  Representatives of the Armenian government invited for a joint discussion insist on the possibility of maintaining the national principle.
  However, the Georgian government orders to occupy the area up to the central part of the tunnel between Gharakilisa and Shahali, against which the Armenian National Council is protesting in "Paykar" newspaper.
Under certain conditions, the Armenian government considered it possible in principle to make concessions to Georgia in the Akhalkalaki region.
  It was supposed that the descendants of Western Armenians living here could relocate to the territories to be given to the Republic of Armenia under the Entente pressure.
 Georgia, in turn, is obliged to defend the Armenian demands before the Peace Assembly in case of receiving Akhalkalaki, at the same time to support Azerbaijan's agreement to cede some disputed territories to Armenia2.
The Georgian military units managed to capture most of the Lori police station (northern part) and set up checkpoints with the Germans along the left bank of the Kamenka River (Dzoraget).
Their main outposts were located in Vorontsovka, Haydarbek, Alexandrovka, Tsater, Kober, Karinj settlements.
  The Turkish line stretched along the right bank of the Kamenka River, through the villages of Novo Pokrovka, Jalaloghli, Nikolaka, Gyargyar, Vardablur, Kurtan, Darakend, then eastwards, between Kober և Kolageran stations to the town of Martur 3
Georgian party and politicians aspired to see not only the whole province of Tbilissi (Georgia) as part of Georgia, but also 3 R. Hovhannisyan, Republic of Armenia, Yerevan, 2005, pp. 75-76.
Pambak Valley (First Police Station of Alexandropol Province, Yerevan Province) 1.
 During the talks between the representatives of the Armenian and Georgian National Councils, one of the leaders of the Georgian Social-Democratic Party, member of the government I. Tsereteli states that the Armenian-Georgian border should be such that the provinces of Borchalu and Ghazakh are on the Georgian side, and after the departure of the Turks, the province of Akhalkalaki and the Pambak region of Alexandropol2.
 In order to maintain their position in the Caucasus and deepen the Armenian-Georgian conflict, Khalil Pasha, commander of the Turkish troops on the Eastern Front, secretly warned Jamalyan in Tbilissi (Georgia) in October that Georgia was going to invade not only Akhalkalaki and Borchalu provinces, but also Pambak. where no Georgians lived 3.
  Of course, the Georgian ambitions towards both Pambak and Kazakh in Elizavetpol province had a purely tactical purpose, to later announce that they were conceding those territories to Armenia.
Georgian politicians try to substantiate Georgia's ambitions towards Lori-Akhalkalaki by historical, geographical and economic factors, ignoring the national principle.
 However, the need for those territories to be part of Armenia is substantiated, first of all, in national terms.
  105,000 Armenians, 15,000 Muslims, 1,150 Georgians, 13,000 other nations (Greeks, Russians, etc.) or 85.81% Armenians and 0.85% Georgians lived in the disputed part of Borchalu province և Pambak region.
 As for the province of Akhalkalaki, the region of Tsalka, which is its natural continuation, there were 82,000 Armenians, 9,000 Muslims, 7,400 Georgians, 8,000 other nations, that is, 77.35% Armenians and 6.9% Georgians4.
  Geographically, Lori and Akhalkalaki are part of the Armenian Highlands.
 Historically, both provinces have gone hand in hand many times, but they have always preserved their Armenian nature.
  Strategically, they are a natural defense frontier, and economically, these lands rich in pastures, forests, and mineral resources are vital for the Republic of Armenia, which is poor in natural resources.
The Armenian government has made several official complaints. Harutyunyan, Atlas of the History of Armenia, Part B, Yerevan, 2008, pp. 62-63.

He always told the Turkish-German governments, the German-Austrian missions about the liberation of the territories belonging to Armenia under the Batumi Treaty, and always received an answer that the occupation was temporary1.
 According to the protocol signed between the Turkish and Armenian headquarters on October 5, the Turkish troops are obliged to leave the territory of the republic2.
  Finally, on October 18, after the withdrawal of Turkish troops from Pambak and southern Lori, based on the same protocol, 3 Armenian troops attached to the Dro officer corps in Dilijan occupied Lori, from the Shahal station on the border of Yerevan province to the Kamenka River, that is, to the Turkish line.
  Several patrols along the railway reach Tsater-Kober, the end of the Georgian-controlled section of Lori.
  However, the presence of German officers on the Georgian side forces the Armenians to leave Kober and Waters.
  Once again the Armenian side occupied the villages of Korinj (Karinj) and Ծater, but on October 26 they were forced to leave those two villages4.
 The Germans ask the Armenians not to cross the Tsalka River, which they consider the Georgian border, at the same time forbidding the Georgians to cross the "Turkish" line5.
Thus, in the first period of the Armenian-Georgian confrontation, Armenia managed to establish control over Southern Lori, and attempts to move north ended in failure.
All attempts to resolve the issue of the Lori territory through peaceful, diplomatic means failed, the Armenian-Georgian armed conflict became inevitable.
 On December 5, the Georgian troops enter Akhalkalaki.
  Upon learning of the incursion of Georgian troops, an Armenian detachment on the orders of the government occupied the area adjacent to the Alexandropol province of Akhalkalaki province on December 7, avoiding a military confrontation with Georgia.
  The purpose of this demonstrative action was to establish the right of the Armenian side towards Akhalkalaki, but at the request of the Georgian side they retreated to Alexandropol, leaving the villages of Efremovka-Troitskoye in the province of Akhalkalaki6.

It was a matter of redevelopment, it was quite expensive for the Armenians of Armenia, particularly Javakhk.
  "The steps taken by the Armenian leadership with a considerable delay did not yield tangible results."
  The difficult situation created for Armenians in the Lori region is discussed at the December 12, 13, 16 sittings of the Council of Armenia2.
By the order of the Government of Armenia, the Dilijan-Lori military unit, under the command of Dro, will advance on Vorontsovka-Privolnoye, Opret-Ayrum3 line on October 14.
 Until December 15, the Armenian troops occupy Vorontsovka, Privolnoye, Sanahin, Mikhailovka, Alaverdi.
  Ayrum station and Bolnis-Khachen will be liberated on December 16-20.
 Capturing the village of Shulaver, the Armenian forces reached the Khram River, and on December 22 liberated Sadakhlu station and the outskirts of the village.
  With the capture of the village of Beliy-Klyuch in the province of Shulaver and Tbilissi (Georgia), the Armenian armed forces appear 50 km away from the capital of Georgia4.
  On December 25, the representatives of the allies in Tbilissi (Georgia) demand an end to the war.
  According to British Lieutenant Colonel Jordan, who arrived in Tbilissi from Baku, the Armenian and Georgian armed forces should liberate the formerly occupied Turkish territory, including Akhalkalaki, "replace it with British troops" and decide on their status at the Paris Peace Conference.
Georgia rejects the offer - the British make changes to their initial proposals, according to which Georgian troops should remain in Akhalkalaki, in the northern part of Borchalu, Armenian troops in South Borchalu, and in the area between them there should be a British "Neutral Zone".
  Thus, the Armenians were to retreat to the Dsegh-Jalaloghli line.
They had to give in to strong British pressure, as the British military mission was in charge of both the Armenian-Georgian and the entire Transcaucasian issues6.
1919 At a conference of Armenian and Georgian allies on January 9-17, 1945, the Armenian side was forced to agree to 1 A. Melkonyan, Javakhk in the 19th century and the first quarter of the 20th century in Akhalkalaki, Yerevan, 2003, p. 299.

However, under the control of the allies, the participation of the Armenians in the administration was guaranteed, which did not happen.
  Eventually Georgia is finally settled in that area.
 The conference approved the plan proposed by the British to establish a neutral zone in Borchalu, which would extend from the outskirts of Sadakhlu to the positions occupied by Armenian troops before the two-week war.
1919 At the sitting of the Armenian Parliament on January 25, 1919, the Minister of Foreign Affairs presents the 1919 The decision was signed by the plenipotentiaries of Georgia and Armenia at the conference held on January 9-17.
 According to the decision, the border of the neutral zone of Borchalu province in the north was to form the line that connected in 1918. The positions occupied by the Georgian military units as of December 31, 2010.
 It stretched from Legli-Dagh in a straight line of the mountain range to Irghanchayugh village, then in a straight line to the culvert of Kulutash peak. Village, Sadakhlo village, Sadakhlo station, up to Tanadagh mountain, then the border reached Eminch - Khachkaya mountain, Palutli Bash peaks.
The villages of Irganchai, Saati, Jandar, Aghkyorpi, Opret, Khojorni, Brdadzor, Sadakhlo remain north of the border line1.
The southern border of the neutral zone of Borchalu province is considered to be the Dsegh-Jalaloghli line, which was determined in 1918. by the agreement of December 25.
  Thus, it can be said that the borders of the Neutral Zone crossed the following line. The southern border was Dzoraget, the northern border was the Armenian Mountains of Georgia, in the west were the Wet Mountains, and in the east were the Gugarats Mountains2.
 In the north of the neutral zone, Georgian troops occupied the area from Akhalkalaki province to the village of Opret.
  The Armenian troops were to be stationed from the Kolageran station to the Dsegh section, as well as in the Jalaloghli-Gyargyar section.
  The neutral zone of Lori included the Alaverdi copper mines, 43 villages, the approximately 30-mile section of the predominantly Armenian railway with 6 stations.
 The territory of the neutral zone was divided into Uzunlar, Vorontsovka և Alaverdi precincts, each of which had 4-5 volosts, provincial-village groups.
  Alaverdi precinct had 4 volos with 11 villages, Uzunlarin (now Odzun) with 4 vols with 11 villages, Vorontsovka with 5 vols with 15 villages 1 Minutes of the sittings of the Parliament of the Republic of Armenia, p. 163.

  The Armenian-Georgian border was the same in 1918-1920. It was not clarified.
  Later, in 1921, it was finally clarified.
  According to the agreement, the border started from the Uch-talar mountain peak bordering Turkey, Armenia and Georgia, reaches Ortul Daghler to the east, then bends northeast-east, leaving Madatapa Lake and Troykoy village to Khairab, now Kharab, Georgia գյուղ The villages of Darakey (Saragyugh) to Armenia, up to Legli Dagh (now the Achkasar peak in the Javakhk mountains), then the border would cross the watershed of the Armenian mountains of Georgia to PalutliBash 2.
  According to the experts of the People's Council of the Armenian SSR, from ethnographic, economic and other points of view, Agh Korpi, Opret, Khokhmel, Brdadzor, Gulibagh, Damia, Lichkadzor, Khozhorni, Chanakhchi, Chochkan և and other villages should be part of Armenia with their lands.
  That is, they were against the annexation of the Armenian villages north of the watershed of the Armenian Mountains to Georgia3.
  However, the border mainly crossed the northern border of the Neutral Zone4.
  The examination of the material allows the following conclusions to be made: Akhalkalaki province, which is a disputed territory between Armenians and Georgians, is located in the Tsalka region, south of the Khram River in the Borchalu province of Tbilissi (Georgia), as well as the southwestern part of Ghazakh province. belonged to the Armenian people in strategic terms, 1918-1920. They became disputed territories between Armenians and Georgians.
The disputed territories belonging to Armenia and the Armenian people before the proclamation of nation-states in the Transcaucasia were accepted by the national and political regions of Navra.
  Moreover, the issue was raised at the level of state-territorial, not just at the level of administrative divisions of Transcaucasia.
In the first period of the Armenian-Georgian confrontation (October 1918) the control of the Armenian side over South Lori was established, but the attempts to move north ended in failure.
The victory of the Armenian army in the two-week Armenian-Georgian war forced the allied forces in Transcaucasia to take Lori out of Georgian control, to create a Neutral Zone there, which 1S. Karapetyan, Armed Uprising in Lori in 1921, Yerevan, 1955, pp. 12-14.
