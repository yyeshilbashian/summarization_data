The modern educational system makes the student a subject of social-political processes, which closely combines the interests of a "national citizen" and a "free citizen".
At the current stage of the establishment of the "New World Order", many values ​​of Western liberalism penetrate the sphere of the Armenian reality, significantly changing the socio-cultural ideas of the Armenians.
 At the same time, complex systemic changes, democratic and integration processes are taking place in Armenia, in particular, Armenia's membership in the EEU.
 Besides, there is the issue of international recognition of NKR independence.
 That is why the rational formation of the ethno-political culture of the Armenian student is becoming urgent now, which will allow him not only to understand the complex socio-political processes, but also to develop rational approaches to solve complex problems from an impartial scientific position.
The aim of the research is to reveal the essence of the ethno-political culture of the Armenian students, their peculiarities, the ways and means of its formation.
The target of the research is the university student, and the subject is the point of view of its ethno-political culture.
The following issues were raised in the work.1. to identify the negative factors influencing the ethno-political culture of the student, 2. cover the interaction of democratic institutions, ethno-cultural components, the distinction between civic and national identity, 3. Explain the formation of students' ethno-political culture in the context of educational reforms.
The components of the ethno-political culture of the modern student are: self-consciousness, language, religion, customs and traditions, national mentality, mentality, moral norms, political knowledge and values, political behavior, life experience, political orientation.
 These are the reasons for the nature and level of political activity, especially when they become a conviction.
 The student, as a representative of the Armenian ethnos, has not only a unique individual mentality, but also ethnic collective value orientations, therefore he is responsible for his actions.
 By local morality, G. Nzhdeh advises the young youth to be constantly committed to the eternal values ​​of the nation, and to direct the worldview "to the goals of his nation and state, his happiness has only one justification - to serve him for the happiness of his nation" [1, p. 151].
 The blood-kinship qualities and lifestyle of the parents first of all influence the formation of the ethno-political culture of the generations.
 In addition, they inherit and assimilate their collective national traits: warmth, intelligence, hospitality, diligence, nationalism, xenophobia, family worship.
The Armenian student, entering into interconnection with other ethnoses, understands the uniqueness of his personality, his belonging to a certain ethnosocium.
  Therefore, the self-expression of an individual in social processes is impossible without national self-consciousness.
Ethnicity was decisive for Armenians, as they are a cultural center in the absence of their own state, in the face of culture, church, family, national ties, they have preserved their national identity.
The current social environment, the student audience, changes the biological genes of the youth, giving "we" a cultural orientation that is less "mobile and changing than political and economic" [2, p. 90].
A young person who is alienated from political life and does not have a clear goal and political position cannot actively participate in politically motley processes.
  The lecturer's task is to prepare video-practical skills և specialists with moral features for building a future civil society.
  The lecturer's speech "before the word of the lips, are outbursts of the heart" [3, p. 9].
At present, the students' loss of trust in political institutions is noticeable, which explains their passive desire to join parties and NGOs.
 The students do not show any special activity during the presidential, parliamentary and local elections because of the use of PR (electoral fraud), as the voter is not able to express his will, as a result of which illegitimate statesmen appear.
The leader who came to power with the technology of the CC is unlikely to fulfill the promises of the people, to carry out pro-Armenian activities, to regain confidence, to increase the dissatisfaction and the atmosphere of fear.
  Corruption, social tensions, rapprochement of statesmen with oligarchs, disintegration of parties, pressure on non-pro-government opposition parties, money laundering, activation of criminal elements, and electoral fraud contribute to the decline of the legitimacy of the authorities in authoritarian states.
All this has a negative impact on the student's political behavior and appreciation of caring values.
  He is alienating himself from the homeland due to social exclusion.
  Man leaves his native country, stops worshiping that geographical, socio-cultural area, where he has been deprived of various rights, the prospect of participating in socio-political, cultural life.
 Patriotism becomes an abstract feeling towards a country that has left itself defenseless.
The fact that a student is alienated from political life is conditioned by the possibility of his objective influence on political solutions.
The student ceases to be an entity that understands his responsibilities and rights, when the lecturer silences his critical speech, condemns conformism, spontaneity and self-isolation.
  In that case, the student's mentality, in Dostoevsky's words, is not opposed to "moral feelings in the blood."
If the older generation clings to old stereotypes, finds it difficult to adapt to new socio-cultural values, then the youth, being a more receptive institutional group, adapts more quickly to new living conditions and is fanatically inclined to accept Western cultural values, especially liberalism.
 Students reinterpret old values ​​և combining them with new values.
The modern student is in the field of fragmented, contradictory value systems, where there are values ​​of "liberal culture" and "traditional culture".
The student, not having a rich life experience, assimilates the once false values ​​under the influence of chaotic political situations, the immoral norms do not find their full embodiment, therefore a pessimistic, negative mood arises in him.
  The more knowledgeable students master the Western information technology civilization, the more and more they realize the problems of preserving the qualitative peculiarities of our national culture.
The hasty establishment of Western educational models in our schools has led to socio-cultural distortions, ethnic distortion, and loss of identity.
 Western liberal values ​​do not harm the Armenian ethnic identity if the "institutions of traditional national-social relations" of coexistence ամբողջական the whole socio-cultural concept become a guide to activity.
The marginalization of social-educational institutions, the devaluation of national ideas, the penetration of foreign views greatly aggravate inter-ethnic contradictions between different social strata.
The destructive tendencies of the bourgeois consumer society, homosexuality, anti-national religious և globalization are alien to the national mentality and psyche of a reasonable student.
The Armenian socio-environment, the current social relations are the result of the formation of the student's unique behavior.
 Therefore, according to surveys, 24% of our students are not against "brain drain" in countries where highly educated staff are well paid.
  Abroad, the task of preserving the ethnic identity is served, the homeland is moved to a more important internal sphere: national language, manners, traditional family relations, religion, historical memory.
The image of a rational-legal leader has a positive effect on the formation of the student's political culture, who is guided by ephemeral rights, carries out purposeful activities for the benefit of the people.
There is still no culture typical of civilized democracies in Armenia, which will promote the free political practice of the people.
  Ethnocultural components often oppose the establishment of democratic institutions.
  There is a need for active and purposeful ideological and educational work in schools in the diverse ethnocultural groups with subcultures, as an ethnic whole, mitigating their unique socio-cultural differences.
Without a sense of national dignity, the student is morally bankrupt.
  It is not the ethnocentric attitude that is injected into the Armenian student, but nationalism.
  "Nationalism is aristocratic, as it is conditioned not only by the preservation of the purity of its own race, but also by the fact that it bases the structure of society on the principle of supremacy of national interests over state, class and Ukrainian principles" [4, p. 103].
Nationalism excludes the humiliation of foreigners, attempts to prefer a radical nation, ethnic clashes.
The tendency of self-identification with one's own nation grows with the inner aspirations of the Armenian student's self-consciousness.
  Being a citizen of an independent national state is a powerful factor of ethnic identification.
Today, the Armenian student brings national identity to the forefront, not the civic identity, especially since the historical Homeland and the state of the Armenian people do not coincide in terms of volume and content due to historical circumstances.
 Present-day Armenia is barely one-twelfth of our historical Homeland.
The state is subject to the political management of the society, subject to the political demands of the time, and the homeland is a cautious feeling, referring to the call of blood, outside the realm of political time.
 The state thinking of the Armenians is not great, as it has lost its independence for about 10 centuries.
The more the Armenian student identifies with inner pride with his own ethnos, as a unique social-psychological group with a common origin and mental structure, the more the group goals and norms of his nation are not alien.
 A nation will be strong if it has a significant majority of individuals with positive ethnic identity.
 The modern pro-student educational model is aimed at ensuring an effective student learning outcome that will allow the student to understand the nature of political phenomena, navigate the complex vortex of political situations, analyze pressing political issues, and offer rational solutions to political conflicts.
In other words, the student becomes a subject who actively understands his / her responsibilities and rights and participates in the reforms of the country.
Modern educational reforms have made the university-lecturer, student-dean relations closer, the direct participation of students in the managerial life, and the assessment of their knowledge has become transparent.
  The result is great in the classroom, where the student-lecturer relationship becomes direct, a warm and healthy moral and psychological atmosphere is created.
The high school passes from the educational (authoritarian) old model to the student-centered educational system, which allows the student to become a subject of the educational process.
By interactive methods, students are involved in practical work, developing analytical-investigative thinking.
 The student freely expresses his / her point of view with a critical approach, listens attentively to the classmate expressing an inner opinion, enters into a dialogue.
  The organization of the institute of questions and answers greatly contributes to that.
  The student fulfills his role of a political subject not only through the student council, NGOs, having certain problems և competencies, but also individually as a citizen և individuality, with his characteristic worldview, beliefs, temperament և practice.
  The student council begins to become the student's "ear, eye և voice".
Cultural training contributes to the formation of students' ethno-political culture, which in particular enriches ethno-cultural knowledge և develops social-psychological entrepreneurship.
No matter how hard the West tries to support us in the reform of the education system, it is still not able to solve the national educational problems in principle.
 The point is that the topics with social-ethnic content and the complex approach to Armenian upbringing have greatly decreased in the educational programs.
 In similar conditions, some students think that the farther we go from the national, the closer we will get to the universal.
H. Shiraz, condemning this approach, with great power of talent expressed the idea of ​​moving from the national to the universal. Really, my nation, with your vaccine.
Only such an approach will allow combining the interests of a "national citizen" with a "free citizen" [6, p. 46], overcoming the gap between them.
Every nation becomes universal only in the way of perfection.
 Closed in a national case, it is impossible to establish itself as a full-fledged nation-state.
The universal և national interests have always been ingeniously combined in our identity.
 The ability to creatively assimilate foreign values ​​has been one of the foundations of our vitality, thanks to which we have existed for centuries.
 However, the Armenian spirit is blinded by blind faith in a foreigner.
 The interests of the independent Armenian statehood imperatively demand that the university education be organized in such a way as to preserve the national image of the student, to form a full citizen of a democratic society.
  And that will be possible in the case when the concept of "civil society" brought from the West is creatively mastered and adapted to our national one.
Thus, in the mono-ethnic Armenia, such an educational system must operate, which will combine all modern means in the educational process, will form the ethno-political culture of the student.
The latter has two sides, theoretical and practical.
 It will allow preserving ethnic identity in the conditions of globalization, excluding ethnocentrism, cultural self-isolation, assimilating positive experience in interethnic contacts.
