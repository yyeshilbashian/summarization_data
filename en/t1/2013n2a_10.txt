The question of tax efficiency assessment still has no final answer.
 It is not clear which part of the taxpayer's income is effective - a quarter, a third or a half.
 That is why discussions on tax efficiency are often based on international comparisons based on the gross domestic product of the total amount of planned or actually paid taxes at the macroeconomic level and the percentage of planned or actually paid taxes and gross income at the micro level.
In our opinion, in case of calculating these indicators with the mentioned approach, they cannot reflect the real state of taxation, as the potential of tax arrears, which is a reserve of tax revenues, does not participate in the calculation, the calculation of which can change significantly in case of international comparisons.
 In this regard, the field of international comparisons should also be moved to the percentage ratio of actual taxes and the full tax potential (actual taxes / actual taxes + tax arrears), which give an idea of ​​unscrupulous taxpayer behavior, "shadow economy", corruption, tax system efficiency. about others.
  Meanwhile, the indicators determined by taking into account the taxes actually collected give an idea of ​​the efficiency of law-abiding taxpayers և tax administration.
An indicator used to characterize tax efficiency, which is generalized in national comparisons, is the per capita gross domestic product.
As a rule, the higher this index, the higher the percentage of tax revenues և gross domestic product.
 It is also a proof of the fact that the level of tax efficiency is largely conditioned by the level of development of the country and the solvency of taxpayers.
One of the indicators used in national comparisons to characterize the effectiveness of taxation is the indirect tax rate, which gives an idea of ​​the application of the principle of tax fairness.
The higher the share of indirect taxes, the less attention will be paid to maintaining the principle of tax fairness, as indirect taxes are included in the prices of goods and services, shifting the tax burden on consumers, the majority of whom are the population.
"Non-transparent taxes", ie bribes paid by taxpayers and time wasted in contacts with various state bodies, are considered non-traditional indicators used in the comparisons that characterize tax efficiency, and their presence, especially their growth, reduces the level of tax efficiency.
According to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), 2.1-6.8% of taxpayers' income in countries with economies in transition (which can be considered a "bribe rate" of 1) is used in various countries to bribe various officials (pay a "bribe tax") and pay that tax to 1 government official. The share of illegal payments in the total income of taxpayers.
Payment frequency 1 fluctuates in the range of 8-60% 2.
  According to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, both the corporate tax rate and the frequency of its payment are higher in all surveyed countries, in small and medium-sized enterprises, and in small businesses these figures are relatively small.
 No less important is the time that the heads of economic entities lose in various contacts with state officials.
 For countries with economies in transition, this indicator, ie the time tax (which characterizes the share of working time of public officials in the total working hours of taxpayers) confirms the need to pay due attention to non-traditional methods of taxation3.
It should be noted that it is necessary to calculate the indicators that characterize the effectiveness of taxation and apply it in international comparisons, but it is not enough to assess the level of tax efficiency, as the tax mechanisms used in different countries differ even by types of tax benefits. with the degree of their coverage, the scope of determining the tax base and the scope of taxation, the differentiation of taxes and other factors that determine the amount of tax.
  In this regard, it is necessary to use and calculate the features of the calculation of individual taxes, which reduce or increase the efficiency of taxation by individual types of taxes.
Along with the increase of tax efficiency, the share of tax revenues in the state budget revenues may increase.
  This can be facilitated by the application of the basic principles of tax zoning in economic policy, which will allow the application of certain tax reduction coefficients in border areas, which are less attractive in terms of business development.

After the proclamation of independent statehood, certain organizational, structural and legislative preconditions of market relations were formed in Armenia, which were a mandatory condition for ensuring the continuity of the transformation process.
 Systemic changes were also implemented in the fiscal system of the republic, aiming to create an effective, efficient mechanism in that sphere.
 And although the reforms implemented in the tax sphere of the republic in recent years significantly contributed to the establishment of the fiscal system of the republic, nevertheless there are a number of problems in that sphere, which reduce the efficiency of the tax system, which is conditioned by a number of objective-subjective factors.
  Among the objective factors currently influencing tax policy are the following: • Low opportunities of the tax system in concentrating the amount of income defined by the legislation, • Volume of the tax burden in GDP, • Distribution of the tax burden on a narrower circle of taxpayers, which increases tax pressure on the latter. է the tax burden increases; • the transformation of the tax system as a factor hindering economic growth, reducing investment activity; • the decline of the real sector of the economy as the main taxpayer, which works at the expense of economic entities; the decline in profitability; • the criminalization of the economy. the army of tax evaders,• Weakening of tax regulatory and incentive levers in the direction of business activity, etc.
There are subjective factors influencing tax policy: • economically unfounded steps, mistakes and omissions in the development and implementation of tax policy; Lack of mechanisms և Practice, • Lack of a system for forecasting the results of fiscal policy, • Dependence of fiscal policy on international financial organizations, • Lack of mechanisms for ensuring tax policy from lobbying activities, • Instability of the legislative field և Imperfection,• Low level of tax administration, insufficient professional level of employees involved in tax bodies.
Obviously, the impact of the above-mentioned factors has a very negative impact on the country's economy and financial system, leading to a reduction in the revenue part of the state budget, a decrease in the level of financial security of the state to perform its functions.
  In this regard, financial stabilization measures in the country can not be effective, as long as there are no progress in the implementation of the tax collection budget.
 At present, the tax system of the republic is dominated by the problem of non-payment of taxes, which, in fact, may be conditioned by the general financial crisis in the real sector of the economy, stagnation of production and non-declaration of income.
Tax collection is the most important criterion for assessing the activities of the entire state government, a direct indicator of the efficiency or inefficiency of the tax services.
  At the same time, it is considered by a number of international financial organizations as a key tool for assessing a country's creditworthiness.
 In general, the factors affecting tax collection are grouped according to the economic crisis, management and regulation activities, and the motives of taxpayer behavior.
  The fact that a large part of the cash in circulation has a material impact on tax collection, which in turn complicates the financial control of economic processes, is a unique reason for the expansion of shadow activity.
  In this regard, it should be noted that the practice of tax evasion by taxpayers is a very dangerous phenomenon to meet the financial needs of the state.
  Violations in tax relations are extremely dangerous not only for the tax, but also for the socio-economic and political system of the whole country.
  As a rule, in terms of non-declaration of income, weak control over this sector, the commercial and small business sectors stand out.
  However, the volume of cash turnover is the largest in those spheres.
  The situation is further complicated by the fact that currently there are no clear calculations in the country, for example, to determine the average level of profitability of the trade sector, which would allow to form certain ideas about the tax potential of this sector.
  In this regard, it should be noted that the strengthening of tax administration in those areas where there are wider opportunities for shadow activities is becoming an urgent issue.
A significant reason for the low efficiency of the tax system is the issues related to the level of qualification of employees involved in the tax authorities, work organization, social issues.
  It can be said that the means of material incentives created for that purpose in the republic do not serve that purpose at all.
  In this regard, it is very important to set new quality requirements for those involved in the system by providing appropriate guarantees.
 It is no secret that the ultimate goal of economic policy pursued in every country should be to ensure sustainable economic growth.
 Therefore, in this regard, in order to solve the strategic problem, a tax system corresponding to the requirements of a market economy must be formed in the country.
 Of course, in the initial stage of new relations, indirect taxes serve as the main source of revenue for the state budget, which, in our opinion, is objective, as they are able to play the role of budget replenishment more successfully in the conditions of lack of funds.
 In fact, at that stage, the burden of the tax burden falls mainly on the less well-off sections of the population.
  However, it should be noted that the long-term continuation of this situation can become extremely dangerous for the country, especially in the case when they are not able to fully ensure the solution of the problem of financial security of the most important functions of the state.
  In countries with effective market economies, the revenue side of the budget is mainly formed at the expense of direct taxes levied on legal entities and individuals, ie on labor and business taxes1.
 In the tax system of the republic, high taxes act as a factor of restraining the general demand, which causes the economy to decline.
  Indirect taxes, in fact, are not directly related to labor efficiency և capital,, to some extent contradict it, as their calculation is mainly based on factors that determine the profitability of production.
  In some respects they are anti-market in nature, therefore their share should not be large.
In our opinion, the gradual rather than abrupt reduction of the share of indirect taxes in the tax system of the republic should become one of the main directions of economic transformations.
 One of the qualitative characteristics of the efficiency of the tax system is the assessment of the tax burden.
 Of course, it should be noted that the methodology for assessing the tax burden has not been clarified yet.
  There are some direct indicators that can give an indirect idea of ​​the weight of the tax burden in this or that area.
 Many official sources do not deny the fact that there is a tax burden in the country, which becomes an obstacle to the expansion of business and the improvement of the investment environment.
 However, the burden of the tax burden on the republic's GDP is about 14% *.
  In this regard, it should be noted that the main issue of tax policy should be the equal distribution of the tax burden, taking into account the need to ensure social justice and economic development.
 Taking into account the fact that the tax burden in the economic branches and spheres of the republic is quite heavy, ևtaxes perform their uncharacteristic function, that is, the function of confiscation of assets of economic entities, the application of differentiated value added tax rate becomes necessary * RA Law of 2012 to approve the report. "
such as in those և sectors that have a low level of profitability for objective reasons.
  It is also necessary to reduce the value added tax rate for some parts of the technology chain, and to apply a zero rate in the less profitable work areas.
 The tax mechanism should interact effectively with monetary policy, providing certain benefits to financial and credit institutions that use long-term loans for investment purposes.
1 It is necessary to regulate the activities of the entities operating in the securities market in a differentiated way, giving privileges to those engaged in targeted investment activities.
  At the same time, it is necessary to show qualitatively new approaches to the institution of tax privileges, defining their strict purposefulness and maturity.
They should be provided only to those sectors that are of primary importance for economic development.
  The granting of privileges should correspond to the state investment programs, the efficiency of which is quite high.
 One of the current problems in the country is the implementation of structural reforms.
  Thus, we believe that the exemption from taxation of any investment in capital investments can not contribute to the solution of this problem, as structural reforms imply the closure of some economically unpromising production.
  Thus, by exempting from profit tax aimed at the expansion of such productions, in fact, the tax system indirectly contributes to the expansion of unprofitable productions.
  Increasing the investment activity of all economic entities cannot be a subject of economic interests of the state.
  Due to that, we think that the definition of the priorities for the development of the republic's economy has become very urgent, after which the provision of appropriate tax privileges for the promotion of investments in those spheres.
 In conclusion, it should be noted that only the protection of the interests of the state, the provision of expanded reproduction of the economy, the creation of a competitive environment, the investment act 1 Suvaryan Yu.

Fiscal policy aimed at increasing the economy can ensure sustainable rates of economic development.
  However, such a policy, in turn, requires a comprehensive understanding and evaluation of the principles of fiscal policy, as well as the creation of a program basis for the implementation of measures conditioned by them.
