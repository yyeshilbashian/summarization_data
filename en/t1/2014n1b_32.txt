Especially for the development of students' logical and scientific thinking in the process of teaching biologyThey are important for independent, practical workimplementation and especially the solution of problems that are at the same time RAThere are various practical components of the new unit assessment system in the modern education system.
 In order to develop the relevant skills of the students, biology petitions guaranteed by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Armenia, hours for solving problems on certain topics are provided for the organization of general education.and biology in pedagogical universities in the professional program"Problem solving methodology" special professional practicesubject.
Problem solving is an active cognitive processMany functions of teaching and upbringing և goals.
It can be considered a "method", a type of educational activity.
Problem solving is often understood as in the classroom or at homeSolving regular problems, doing exercises by the learner,Getting the right answers.
 Of course, it is necessary, but not enoughto ensure the effectiveness of multi-purpose training.
 In fact, the methodological approach to problem solving is that of the teacherOrient և relies not on collections of problems, databasesincludes a variety of tasks - quality - solving problems, during another class or homework.quantitative, simple և complex, difficult և easy, theoretical and practical, experimental, research, constructive և other nature [2].
 To solve a problemThe state of mind and the process should be included not only in the traditional "problem solving" class, but also in the course of any educational material, observations and experiments, research work.
Problems can arise during the discussion of any issue,teacher-student, student-student joint work, independentlyduring work և in different situations.
"Biology Teaching Methodology" university courseOne of the most important sections is the "Problem Solving Methodology".
 That:Based on our experience in teaching the course, note that teachingWhen organizing, we do not teach problem-solving methods, but methodical steps to teach problem-solving.teaching through sequential, interrelated questions [1] ևthe analysis of the goals implemented during that period.
In our work we will present our experience of problem-solving methodology և we will analyze biologicalopportunities to achieve different goals of education and upbringing by solving problems.
Introducing students to a biology class in high school is not accompanied by the need to solve problems from the very beginningwith the formation of consciousness.
  Therefore, in the 8th grade, when the learnerFor the first time, it is related to problem solving as a component of the assessment of educational achievements, an important and mandatory process of learning biology.in a tense, stressful state, especially if he has not been "friendly" with mathematical subjects.
 It is clear that the formation and development of problem-solving skills is long and difficult for the learneris a job, and requires a pedagogical teacher from a biology teacherA particularly literate, psychologically gentle and patient attitude.
 It is very important to provide a psychological atmosphere for the problemsThe solution should not be perceived as a requirement to receive a grade with a relevant component in biology, a mandatory assignment;upbringing of other character, clarifying the human-nature, reality-personal life relations, biological knowledge for the welfare of life, ensuring a healthy lifestyle, economica way to use it in activities, to plan different processes, to develop thinking, independence և other skills.
In our opinion, one of the priority steps for a teacher to start solving problems is to acquaint the students with the structural and content features of the questionnaire.
 The learner must be goodKnow the structure of the questionnaire, the meaning of the symbols, be able to find the problems related to the relevant theoretical sections, use the explanations at the beginning of each topic correctly, as well as the answers and the appendix.
 Once you have mastered these skills, you can move on to developing problem-solving skills.
  Therefore, it is expedient to implementThe following steps: 1. clarify the topic to which the problem relates;2. Read the problem carefully, explain, clarify everything in the problemfamiliar և unfamiliar concepts,3. Separate the main և auxiliary concepts, information (for example, inheriting a trait often mentioned at the end of problems as a result of solving similar problems in the genetics sectionnature becomes not very tense, information requiring mechanical treatment), 4. Teach the conditional used to solve the problemsigns, develop skills to use them, 5. Develop the problem to differentiate the terms and conditions of the problemsummarizing skills  6. Identify the connection between the main concepts of the topic and the given problemterms and conditions, indicate ways to use them (e.g.scheme of energy exchange reactions, scheme showing the DNA-RNA-protein link, theoretical ideas related to the problem, etc.)7. make a scheme or plan of successive steps;8. Indicate the missing steps, data in the diagram;9. Theoretically clarify the possibilities of implementing these steps based on the available data;10. Develop creative thinking with the help of the schemeWays to find missing data with data combinationslooking for11. choose the most effective way12. be able to make transitions of units of measurement, make accurate mathematical calculations, check them, etc.
From the mentioned stepsduring each implementation, exceptfrom directly maturing the problem-solving process, imperceptiblyMany other goals appear և are solved.
 In our opinion, if thatIf the goals are clearly formulated, to be included in the "assets" of the educational tasks set by the teacher, then it can be said with confidence that the result of the training is more satisfactory or It will be multi-purpose.
We used GPMI as a material to create this "asset"Biology for the 2012-2013 academic year with the 4th year students of the specialty "Problem Solving Methodology" coursethe individual works created by them as a result of the discussions held during
  For each topic discussed, students developed independent methods for teaching specific problem-solving [1] ավորել substantiate the goals achieved during that time.
 The steps proposed by each of them were discussed in the classroom, changed, supplemented, became everyone's property.
Before choosing a solution, the data must first be assumedthe starting level of the class on the topic where neededTraining should be organized.
  Then the main, obvious, primary goals were determined, for the implementation of which the practical work of solving a problem is done.
  The logic of the proposed path և its correspondence to the grade level was substantiated.
Adding and replacing with new questions found with everyone's consent:Algorithms of supposed answers to sequential questions that develop logic have been developed: chains.
  From some steps, different solutions have been proposed in a different sequence.analyze their strengths and weaknesses.
  In the course of each question, the purpose for which this or that was chosen was emphasizedthat way.
 The goal set in a certain step has been separatedև Write in the "asset" of specially created goals, indicating the number of the problemը The step that led to seeing that goal.
  Any problemThe topic, as well as the teaching methods offered by each student, contributed to the continuous enrichment of those goals.
 Below we will present the final result, for the creation of which we used the version edited by students Tsoghik Meliksetyan and Lida Edigaryan.
  Any primary goal highlighted is invisibly linked to other goals,which we have presented in italics.
Thus, as a result of acquiring problem-solving skills, in the learning process it is possible to: 1. Make the lesson more interesting and active.
  Develop individualgroup և collaborative work skills.
  Theory:Ability to use the material in practice, collaborativework, communicating the opinions and suggestions of others, contributing to the solution of the problem, even with a small contribution ևetc., make the lesson more interesting and useful.
 At the same time, they ensure the involvement of everyone, the development of individual, group and cooperation skills.
  In most cases, the solutionIn the process of finding together, learners do not know what they do not knowThey learn from their classmates or overcome difficulties with their help.
 Such an atmosphere develops such moral values,such as friendliness, devotion, mutual help, will and perseverance to overcome difficulties, finish work, express one's own opinion, position, point of view andDevelopment of defense capabilities.
 And for the teacher, the character, temperament and abilities of the learner are revealednew sides.
2. Helps those who lack self-confidenceto overcome or get rid of "fears".
  For this purpose, the student with the lowest level of knowledge can be involved in the problemby asking someone familiar with the concept with a guiding questioninformation about that concept or something related to itbringing out որեն necessarily evaluating it as an achievement.
 And even the smallest contribution to the success of the overall case or the smallestAchieving one's own achievements contributes to the learner's self-esteem, self-confidence, self-esteem և othersto evaluate the possibilities correctly and to form an objective opinion.
3. Development of the ability-skills to use the application book և other sources correctly.
 As we have already mentioned, the solution of the first problemIt is necessary to get acquainted with the structure and sections of the petition, especially to use the meaning of the նշ appendix.
 The development of this feature will also develop the skills to use any source correctly.
4. Concentration.
  In order to cultivate the ability to focus on work, one must first develop the awareness of the need to read carefully several times, to pay attention to each thought, requiring to read not only the mind, but also aloud the requirement, the essence of the problem.to fully understand correctly, especially unfamiliar conceptsto pay attention to, between familiar and unfamiliar conceptsto find a connection, to finally find the key to a solution.
5. Establishment of interdisciplinary և interdisciplinary connections, strengthening of knowledge.
 Applying theoretical knowledge in practice.
When solving any new problem, they are used not only for the given topicrelated to other content / mathematics, physics,Chemistry, ecology, mother tongue և etc. / acquired knowledge and skills.
 This ensures the repetition of the previous material, the previous oneThe opportunity to supplement the imperfect knowledge, the strengthening and development of what has already been acquired, the enrichment of knowledge, the development of skills to apply them in a new, unfamiliar situation.
6. Development of skills to evaluate time correctly.
 At first glance, it seems to be a skill that has nothing to do with solving a problem.
 MeanwhileOne of the key conditions for the success of any job is to accurately assess the adequacy of time and other resources.
7. Development of questioning skills.
  Correct, guiding,Formulation of purposeful questions is based on the knowledge of theoretical knowledge, the ability to find connections between conditions and requirements, the ability to penetrate the meaning of the story, the knowledge of the mother tongue.
Questions arising from one another unknowingly develop logical thinking, to express one's own opinion, to express oneself freely,Ability to communicate with others, oral speech.
8. Development of successive steps to solve the problem, development of rational ways;Perceptions of causation, planning skillsdevelopment.
 Directly derives from the skills mentioned in the previous paragraphs, because perceiving time as the most precious value pushes rationallyto develop and develop the ability to think, to weigh steps, to make the most of all possibilities.
 And through the questions composed in a logical sequence, the activity plan is designed for the learner, the sequence of purposeful steps is clarified, the possibility of choosing a more rational way to solve the problem in the given situation is formed, educates the understanding of steps and actionsattitude.
9. Ability to distinguish the primary from the secondary.
 This goal: It directly follows from the 6th-8th goals.
10. Development of decision-making, orientation, choice skills.
 The ability to solve the same problem in different ways develops creative thinking և strengthens the ideas about the relativity of phenomena formed during the study of biology և related sciences, which is very important for the ability to make decisions, orient, make choices in any unexpected situationfor upbringing.
11. Creating problem situations, acquiring skills and abilities to get out of them, creative thinking, development of imagination.
 Creating a problem situation is one of the most expedient ways for the teacher to intervene in the problem solving process.
If the teacher guides the students to find a solution, it creates an opportunity for everyone to express their own opinion, suggestedto analyze all the options, to form a critical attitude,to develop.
 Such an atmosphere is conducive to learners as wellfor the development of creative thinking, summarizing, drawing conclusions.
  For the teacher, they are also revealed to the learnerbehavior in a similar situation, a way out of itto find its possibilities և other features.
12. Development of knowledge coordination, schematic, application of symbols, modeling skills, ability to express concisely but clearly և.
  As mentioned in the previous pointsthe learner as a result of providing skills and abilitieshe must be able to use the symbols, to understand themmeaning, read the information expressed by them, make combinations, expressions, make calculations, that is, to complete the solution of the problem mathematically, to achieve the final goal.
 The use of symbols to solve problems also develops symbolic thinking, which is very important for the development of logic and the perception of cause-and-effect relationships.
 The realization of all the goals mentioned in this point is theoreticaland will serve as a practical basis for the learner's further learning, development of research work skills, and formulation skills.
In our opinion, as a result of achieving the presented goalsIt will also be possible to raise the level of general literacy and development, to develop the awareness of the evaluation of the teaching-learning process, which is the most important for cognition.in the continuous process of development.
