The processes of teaching and upbringing have common features in dialectical unity, they are conditioned by the logic of the educational process.
 Education is considered the main and main means of upbringing.
  There is no education without education և there is no education that does not educate (J. Herbert).
 The educational function of education was substantiated by A. Disterverg, philosophers G. Hegel, I. Kant և others based on the direction of upbringing։ the ratio of teaching and upbringing.
  Discussing the issue of the effectiveness of a clearly targeted educational process, we consider the choice of method during the activity as a key means of achieving the set goal, due to which actions are taken, situations are created, problems are solved.
Education is a process specially organized by the society, of pedagogical importance, the essential features of which are conditioned by the reciprocity of that process, with the aim of realizing the child's intellectual and personal development, establishing an effective rate of development, ensuring a certain level of education.
  "When describing teaching, one should pay special attention to the question 'how to teach?', Because the effectiveness of the whole teaching process is positively conditioned by the theory of teaching methods that have answered that question" (5, p. 105).
Education is one of the main concepts of pedagogical science, it is decisive in almost all pedagogical understandings, as a consciously organized activity of a person, it also has essential features.
 They are conditioned by purposefulness and planning, organization, reciprocity of processes, positive behaviors accepted in the society, acquisition of qualities based on the demand of the society, patterns of personal development, individual peculiarities, current political, economic, social, cultural conditions, available means and opportunities.
The choice of methods of the educational process depends on a number of criteria: general educational goals, time and conditions necessary for implementation, teacher's work, etc.
 The method of choosing the method և application is multifaceted և multifactorial.
 The teacher, who has his own way of working, uses the method, guided by his own values, feelings, moods, expectations and expectations.
  Very often the method is used as a law, which is determined in advance, it must be applied regardless of everything, because it is for everyone, it must be universally acceptable.
  In the case of such coercion, which is always under control, such a choice and application of methods, we think, can not be considered effective.
  "The teacher, knowing his inner needs, will create a unique, independent way of activity" (1, p. 612).
 Moreover, prominent Armenian pedagogue G. Edilyan thought that every teacher should have his own method, to force him to do what does not come from his inner needs is never desirable (1).
  The role of the learner, who is endowed with heredity, exclusivity, has individual features, carries the influences and influences of the social environment, is no less important in the choice of the method.
 We think that in this whole it is necessary to consider the relation of the method of the educational process with the child's personality, proceeding from the paradigm of a learning-centered approach.
Every educational process has sensory-observational, intellectual capacity-building, moral qualities, willpower, education and upbringing, all of which can և ensure the development of the child's personality.
  Central to the choice of method is the issue of their interconnectedness, which can ensure effective, harmonious, influential relations with oneself, the social environment and society.
 This means that the goals of upbringing summarize the development of a person's "self", the ideas and approaches to make a person a citizen, integrate him into public life, work and teach a person to live.
The method in the context of our discussion is a set of cognitive principles, means, approaches, tricks that regulate the objects of the educational process և objects և subjects, in the choice of which the structure, content and content of the textbooks also have a special place.
The choice of method determines the effectiveness of the learner's self-learning and self-discipline processes, which may later enable him to stand out in society according to his personal qualities, attitudes, principles of activity, and to choose his method of life in terms of their effectiveness.
In modern pedagogical science there is a need for a more in-depth study of the criteria of method selection, because the more correctly the method of the pedagogical process is chosen, the more effective the process is, the individual actions are regulated, clear and reliable.
  Proper selection and application of well-grounded, meaningful methods and tricks can be considered as a condition for the effectiveness of the educational process.
