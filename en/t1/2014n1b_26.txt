In the conditions of radical social changes, the study of the problem of physical education of schoolchildren of different ages and genders acquires special significance.
  In recent years, a number of works have been published on the physical education of urban schoolchildren in the country [3, 4 ÷á others].
  At the same time, there is practically no research conducted on the example of students living and studying in rural areas.
It is also known that the natural and climatic conditions of different regions have a certain effect on the physical condition of the learning youth.
 Rural conditions are no exception in this respect [6, 7, 10 ÷á others].
 Therefore, the problems of physical education in rural areas should not be implemented autonomously, without taking into account the territorial-national peculiarities of the external environment.
The task of this work was to study the state of physical development and mobility of schoolchildren living in rural areas of Armenia.
Three physical development (body height, body weight ÷á chest circumference) ’•÷Å six motor training were studied: agility (20 m run), muscular strength (wrist dynamometer), jumping (long jump), agility (3x10 m running), balance Strength ("Flamingo" test) ÷á endurance (500 m run) indicators.
The studies were conducted in 10 rural schools of Armavir region.
 767 students aged 11-15 participated in the experiments.
  The actual numerical material obtained in the work was developed using the methods of mathematical statistics [5] others].
 The degree of reliability of quantitative and qualitative characteristics of statistical material was assessed.
 The arithmetic mean values ‚Äã‚Äã(ùëøÃÖ), the mean square deviation of a particular combination (ÔÅ≥), the arithmetic mean error (m) were calculated.
The reliability score of the difference between the two age groups was determined using the Student's t-criterion, after which the degree of difference probability (P,%) was determined using a special table.
As a result of the research, it was revealed that all the features of physical development improve with age, which is considered a normal phenomenon.
  Thus, from the age of 11 to 15, the body height of boys increases by 25.5 cm, and that of girls - by 14.8 cm.
  During the same period, the body weight increases accordingly - 19.2 ÷á 15.0 kg.
 The movements of the breast circumference indicators are approximately the same in terms of gender ÷á are confirmed by the results of mathematical analysis (Table 1).
Indicators of Physical Development of Pupils Living and Studying in Rural Tables Table 1 Age Quantity Breast circumference, vertebrae Body height, cm Body weight, girls Unfortunately, the assessment of the physical condition of children and adolescents living in rural areas of Armenia has not been the subject of special study.
 Only one work done a quarter of a century ago can be pointed out.
  However, this study was conducted in the alpine conditions of Armenia in adjacent age groups: 8-9, 10-11, 12-13.
 Attempts to combine to some extent the results obtained by us with the author's materials made it possible to note that in the studies conducted at different periods, there are almost no differences in the physical developmental characteristics of rural students.
Summarizing the data we received, it can be stated at the same time that according to their absolute data, the physical development characteristics of boys are higher than those of girls.
 However, in certain age groups, the characteristics of girls prevail, for example, in body height at 11 years old, in body mass at 11 ÷á 13 years old.
At the same time, girls in all age groups have an advantage in terms of breast circumference.
 Therefore, it can be concluded that rural conditions to some extent affect the physical development characteristics of adolescent schoolchildren.
 As for the level of motor training of rural schoolchildren, the effect of age development patterns on the development of muscle strength, agility, endurance and other abilities is evident here.
  But the gender differences are not the same.
 Thus, from 11 to 15 years old boys' speed abilities improve by 0.5 seconds, girls - by 0.1 seconds, wrist strength by 28.0 ÷á 10.3 kg, jumping capacity - 40.5 ÷á 8.5 cm, to maintain balance. Capacity: 10.0 ÷á 8.7 seconds, and endurance: 33 ÷á 27 seconds (Fig. 1).
During the observed period, the boys' rapid abilities ÷á jumping ability improved 5 times, and strength abilities - 3 times more compared to girls.
 The indicators of agility, endurance and balance of boys and girls develop almost uniformly.
 For a more in-depth analysis of the physical condition of rural 11- to 15-year-old bisexuals, we tried to identify students with accelerated (accelerated) and slow (retarded) development of motor skills.
 As an example, the indicators of agility, muscle strength ÷á endurance are considered (Fig. 2).
 It follows that with age, the development of mobility skills of rural schoolchildren compared to gender is generally slowed down.
Thus, with all three motor abilities - agility, muscle strength - endurance, accelerated boys make up 20%, and girls - 40, in all other cases the growth of the indicators is slowed down.
 It is clear that these data need to be strictly taken into account when organizing pedagogical influences, aiming to improve the process of physical education.
Thus, the obtained factual data make it possible to fully assess the level of physical condition of bisexual adolescents.
 Schoolchildren living in rural areas of the Ararat Valley have an unequal level of physical development.
  Mainly retardation processes prevail here, in all age groups of boys and girls there are low indicators of breast circumference, in boys 11-14 years of body mass, in girls - 11 ÷á 13 years old.
 In 37.5% of the cases of age-related development of motor abilities, the movements of 12.5% ‚Äã‚Äãof boys and girls are reliable, and in the case of 65.5 ÷á 87.5%, they are unreliable.
Based on the analysis of the obtained results, it can be concluded that the level of mobility of adolescent schoolchildren living in rural areas does not meet the modern normative requirements of physical education school programs ÷á can not be provided only at the expense of school academic hours.
Figure 1. Rural readiness indicators of rural schoolchildren 1. boys, 2. The problem is complicated by the fact that the lack of children and youth sports schools in rural areas does not allow to fully implement the principle of freedom of choice in sports.
  On the other hand, the material and technical base below, the lack of appropriate sports equipment, gyms, why not the staff, significantly limit the solution of the problems of physical education of rural schoolchildren.
 We think that in such conditions, in order to increase the level of students' mobility, it is expedient to conduct additional extracurricular activities in any sport.
  It should be noted that sports-oriented physical education is successfully used in secondary schools in certain regions of Russia.
  There are examples of such systems in Armenia [1, 2].

 Unfortunately, such a practice does not exist in rural schools.
 At the same time, sports provide an opportunity not only to increase physical training, but also to improve the health of learners, to involve them in the values ‚Äã‚Äãof physical culture, to increase the level of physical education.
 Therefore, increasing the efficiency of the educational process of rural schoolchildren in our country requires the search and testing of new pedagogical approaches, which is considered a topical issue.
  Research in this direction continues.
