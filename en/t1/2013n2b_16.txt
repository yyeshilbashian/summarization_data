As we know, during the interactions of microparticles, the energy և redistribution of the impulses of the colliding particles takes place, which may be accompanied by the formation of other particles.
 In particular, elastic interactions are characterized by the conservation of the total kinetic energy of the interacting particles; in the case of all types of interactions, they can be described by means of simple geometric diagrams, pulse diagrams.
  And in the case of naturally high energies, relativistic versions of diagrams are considered.
  In general, the pulse diagram method is widely used for elastic non-relativistic [2] and relativistic [3] processes, as well as for non-elastic collision processes.
  Impulse diagrams allow you to find the impulses and energies of the interacting particles at any scattering angle after the scattering process, as well as to solve the inverse problem.
The following approach is proposed below for the graphical analysis of similar processes.
  Using the mathematical representation of the pulse-energy relativistic invariant, the idea where the horizontal pause of energy values, of the ischemic energy space, is dated to the vertical axis of the particle is the momentum of the "motion."
  energy values, where by relativistic-like geometric modeling of a particle, in particular, the energetic state of a relativistic electron Fig. 1 is plotted in a segment whose horizontal "component" is:
is the pause energy of the electron, and the vertical "component"
, where is the relativistic impulse of the electron (Fig. 1).
  Thus, the energetic states of the particles in the energy space are expressed by the non-directed sections of the line dictated by points or structural conveniences, which connect the starting point O (beginning of the energy calculation) to the position of the particle in the energy space. 42022 cmcPE , Կետ20cmeeEcPe.
  Now let us try to analyze some relativistic processes using such modeling.
1. Compton's appearance.
Fig.2 As we know, the interaction of radiation with the environment causes it to scatter.
  Let's build the energy diagram of Compton's speech.
  Express the energetic states of the interacting particles (free moving electron and falling photon) in the energy space at points A և B, respectively (OA =
և OB =:
  segments where the initial pulse of the photon is).
The law of full conservation of energy proves the invariance of the full energy of an isolated system of interacting particles (lengths of OA հատված OB segments (sum of OA + OB).
An ellipse, being a geometric point of points whose sum of distances from two given points (A և B) has the same constant value, unites in the energy space all possible energetic states of the system of interacting particles (electron և photon) before փոխ interaction.
EO2cmecPP.2constcPcmOBOAeEOAKBKKFIIIIII One of such possible productive states is, for example, the systemic initial state represented by point O.
 Consider the productive state of the system indicated by an arbitrary point K, which is the state of the mapping system after a certain process of electron-photon interaction (after the process of scattering a photon on an electron).
 Here it must be assumed that the BK shock reflects the energy state of the scattered photon, while AK refers to the electron of the repulsion (although such a correlation is not uniform, հնարավոր one of the possible outcomes of the process is reverse correlation).
 Let us now rotate the segments AK և BK, the energy states of the scattered photon և repulsion electron, with the aim of combining them with the energy EO fixed system.
  Such a function will make it possible to determine the magnitudes of the scattered electron pulses of the repulsive electron (Fig. 2).
Step 1
Let intersect at point B կենտրոն with radius BK.
 In this case, the arc is the energy of the photon scattered along the axis E, the pulse of the scattered photon.
Step 2.
Draw the intersection with center A ում at the point along the radius AK.
 In this case, the arc is up to the axis E, where the pulse of the electron is repulsed.
Step 3.
Draw the ով arc with center O until it intersects with the arc at point F.
  As a result, a triangle with BOF pulse radius will be formed (Fig. 3), where.

whereWe will now analyze the steps for the possible application of energy diagram construction Կ for Compton's appearance.
  Suppose that the wavelength of scattered radiation (scattered photon frequency) is experimentally measured, that is, the values ​​of the absolute magnitude of the length of the scattered photon pulse as well as its energy state in the EO space are known.
  The following algorithm can be emphasized after the construction of the energy diagram (Figure 5).

points.
2. Construct an energy ellipse passing through the starting point և O with focal points A and B.
3. Draw an arc with center և radius B, intersect at point K with the ellipse.
 In this way, the productive energy state of the system consisting of an interacting electron և a photon will be determined by the position of the point K, which reflects the interaction in the EO space.
4. Construct the AK part of the energy state of the repulsive electron).
Further construction should proceed in accordance with the procedure set out in steps (1-3) above.
Thus, the diagram of energy states makes it possible to estimate the momentum of the known value of the scattered photon, the magnitude of the scattering angle of the photon, the magnitude of the electron of the repulsion as the angle.
  It is also possible to study the correlations of the parameters of different possible outputs of the scattering process, at point K, which characterizes the productive state of the system after scattering, in the case of permissible displacements of the energy ellipse arc.
It is easy to see that the final product of the system, at point M, in the case of an electron-reflected state of stroke, when AM = OA =
Impulse:
(This can be confirmed by drawing a bow with radius կենտրոն AM with center A, which will intersect with axis E at point O (Fig. 6)).
Line 6 cP2cmecPIeEeP2cme0eP Continuing the construction according to the procedure (1-3) և taking into account that OA + OB = AM + BM, ie BM = OB we can be sure: In this case, the pulse diagram will look like this (Figure 7) (no scattering).
Fig.7 Fig.8 And when the final product state of the system is plotted at point N, then the procedure of steps (1-3) leads to the construction of arc I with center B կենտրոն with radius BN and arc III with radius ON with ON intersect only at point N (Fig. 8). ), that is, the momentum scattering diagram of a photon on a stationary electron will take the following form (Fig. 9).
Line 9 (scattering backwards).
  Thus, the permissible motions of the point K representing the final state of the system after the scattering of the photon on the electron can be made according to the MN segment of the energy ellipse arc, and thus within the scattering range of the photon.
    The angle changes. Now let's look at the inverse problem.
  Suppose the wavelength of the scattered radiation wave at an angle (frequency) is required.
  For this purpose, let us pre-determine certain (photonics analyzes (Fig. 10).
Line 10 Here.
 And according to the law of full energy conservation, where is the full energy of the electron struck.
according to the cosine theorem, where.
 On the other hand.
 From the last two relations we will get: However, as we know for Compton's comparison, comparing the last result with (**), we will get to return to the inverse problem և suggest energy (according to).
  (4) the following procedure for constructing the diagram.
 Let us construct the energy ellipse in space, where 2. From point B, take the line BC at a known angle to the axis OE.
3. From the point B to the axis of the ellipse with respect to the axis according to (4), take the line BD, the intersection of which point K with the energy ellipse will be determined after the final state of the electron-photon system.
 Moreover.
4. Draw an arc I with center B և radius BK, which will intersect with the line BC at point F.
 As a result, Compton's BOF pulse diagram will be formed, the sides of which are:
Here is the pulse of the electron of the strike.
  Thus, knowing the angle of the scattered photon by relating to the scattering of a photon (4), one can determine the frequency pulse, the magnitude, and the magnitude and direction of the electron pulse that characterize the energy diagram.
Let us now consider the following problem using an energy diagram, which relates to the scattering of photons on stationary electrons.
Using the laws of conservation to show that a free electron can absorb a photon.
Solution.
 According to the system of interacting particles in question, the initial ground state includes the photon և free electronegative energy states, which are expressed in the EO energy space by two OA =
 with sections (Fig. 11).
This is how the energy-centered ellipse A, B is plotted, which predetermines the NM arc (AM = OA) of the allowable positions of the point K representing the final state of the photon-free electron system in the EO system of energy calculation.
    It is easy to see that the position of point K (the final state of the system) with respect to the focal points A և B (relative to the initial state of the system) is given by two (AK և BK) energy segments, which in itself proves that the final state of the system is divisible.
  In this way, the physical reality of photon absorption by the free electron is excluded, which would lead to the existence of a single component state of the electron absorbing the photon.
  In other words, conservation laws allow only the scattering of photons by a free electron when the two-component (electron-photon) composition of the system is preserved before or after the interaction.
