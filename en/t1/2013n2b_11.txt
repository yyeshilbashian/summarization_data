In our time the requirements for education have changed.
  In addition to the basic knowledge մշտ constant acquisition of new knowledge, the modern teacher must be familiar with teaching information technologies և have the skills to work with them competently [5; 6; 7].
The acquisition and generalization of ready knowledge becomes not the goal of a person's intellectual development, but aids to that development.
In order to better perform tasks containing complex graphic works in the subject of mathematics, it is necessary to increase the level of use of observational materials.
 As such, the most effective way is a computer display created with MS PowerPoint.
The process of displaying on computer projection screens includes: 1. Determining the purpose of a given topic և Researching 2. Editing a set of audiovisual materials (texts, tables, graphs, sound, etc.) ստեղծ Creating computer animations according to a certain plot, script և design, 3. pilot screening. Checking the working capacity of all elements, 4. the final screening.
The structure of MS PowerPoint allows you to work with the entire display as well as individual transparencies.
  The latter allows you to quickly orient։ move through the translucent membranes, as well as to make changes in the structure և material delivery.
 The sequence of transparent images can be accompanied by sound և animation effects.
The main requirements for the preparation of educational demonstrations are [2]:  the presentation should complement the teacher's speech, not a duplicate  the presentation slides should contain the main provisions of the topic that express the material being studied, պահ maintaining a uniform style in the slides of the same color. Use of no more than 3 fonts in such a way that the information is readable, ը the volume of the presented text should not be large (as much as possible the material should be presented briefly),  develop a concept to influence learners with a specific goal action, to leave an impression (unique) effective through tricks, solutions),։ It is necessary to accurately calculate the display time of this or that transparent image.
  The optimal time required for the presentation of one transparent film is 1-2 minutes, and for the presentation of the whole material - 15-25 minutes, the total number of presentation transparencies should not exceed 25,
  The transparent images of the presentation should not be overloaded with different special effects, because the learners' attention is focused on those effects, deviating from the main topic, Equally used as a mutimedia projector, desktop, bishop, printed papers as an educational material և Concept.
The appearance of the task included in the work is as follows. where, in order to represent the equation (1) more graphically with MS PowerPoint, in case of parametric values, we can solve it graphically, for which we present the equation (1) in the form of a system. where, to solve the problem graphically, we need to construct (2) graphs of system equations; general points of the graphs (the points of intersection of the graphs of the equations or the points of the combined sites can be used to make animations more vividly) [1; 3; 4].
(2) Construction of system function graphs և Transparent images with MS PowerPoint animation effects can be created in the following sequence.1. pre-build the function graph
  in the case of a parameter value using the graph movement rules.
  After reviewing the resulting graph, another method of constructing that graph is proposed (to further increase the efficiency of graph construction in case of parameter values), the construction description of which is as follows: a point is selected on the axis to become zero, և with this point we draw a line parallel to the axis, which is as the axis of symmetry (in case of any value of the parameter).
 parallel to the axis, to which we take the point kxbxx00b0k00constxbkxybxxy00b0k00constxbxxy001bbX00xx0xxY0Y01bX0 manually to call the parameter horizontal .
  This horizontal առանց axis of symmetry intersects at a point, which is conventionally called the main point of the parameter (Fig. 1).
                                                            (Fig. 1) 3. Axis of symmetryAxis of symmetry Horizontal of the parameter Horizontal point to the left և left of the main point of the parameter, we will get the points B և C (points և axis of the graph), and from the main point A1 to the left տեղադր we will place the points B1 և C1.
  B; X0; Points C are boundary points by which the coordinate plane is divided into 4 parts (Fig. 2), (Fig. 2) 1 A1b0x1b12bB; 0; xBCx; 0; C4. adjacent to four sites B և B1; B1 և X0; X0 և C; Connect points C և C1 in straight lines, with BB1 parallel to A1C and line A1B parallel to C1C.
  The points of intersection with the X և Y axes will be respectively (Fig. 3). (Fig. 3) In order to construct graphs for different values ​​of a parameter, find the horizontal parameters of the parameter corresponding to those values, then the main points of the parameter.
  From the parametric principal points it is necessary to draw parallel lines to the lines A1B և A1 C starting from the point A1, until they intersect with the X axis, then parallel lines are drawn from the points of intersection to the lines BB1 և C C1 of the parametric IV plots in case of value և of the constructed graph.
The main point A0 (X0; 0) of the line coincides with the point X0, then sections II և III come out, it remains to take lines parallel to the lines BB1 և CC1 from that point (Fig. 4).
  The graph of the function is a straight line passing through the coordinate origin, which positions: in case of value can occupy the following ancient հ; 10 bxB0; 10bxC10; 0bxEb00bkxy0k Symmetry axis (Fig. 4) a. The variance varies in the case of an abscess with respect to the axis of the abscissa.
  In case of different values ​​of the parameter, the graph of the function intersects at least two points and at most four points.
b. in which case it passes A2 (
; b2) in points.
  In the case of different values ​​of the line և parameter, the graphs of the function will have one subdivision, except for the value, in which case they will have a combined plot, ie a number of solutions, c. In this case, the angle with respect to the axis of the abscissa varies within the range.
  The graphs of the functions will have one intersection point (Fig. 5).
 Fig.5 In all the described points it is necessary that the construction lines, main lines, graphs of functions, intersection և auxiliary points are depicted differentiated by color, egg, animations.
 That is why the accessibility of the presentation of the material with computer display, the simple logical structure և the uncomplicated narration make the teaching process cognitively easy.
In order for the screenings to be effective, it is necessary to select appropriate technical means based on the size of the classroom, to determine the students' seats, to choose the optimal field of view correctly, to arrange a preview by adjusting the screen characteristics, to determine the display time in the classroom. .
The proposed method of teaching through modern information technologies will contribute to the teaching process: 1. to increase the efficiency of the teaching process, 2. to stimulate interest in the lesson, for which new directions of teaching are proposed և methods, 3. easier perception, memorization and reproduction of the lesson by the students, 4. implementation of interdisciplinary relations, 5. intellectual and creative development of students.
