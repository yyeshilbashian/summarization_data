Modern Armenian is presented to the world today in two literary versions: Eastern Armenian and Western Armenian.
 Eastern Armenian is the state language of the Republic of Armenia, the language of universal communication, press, radio, television, theater, cinema, elementary and high schools.
 It is a subject of state care and has been thoroughly studied by linguists.
ArmArmenian is the language of the majority of the Diaspora community.
 Armenians who have taken refuge in the four corners of the world communicate with it, many periodicals are published in this language, radio and television programs are given, and artistic paintings are created.
After gaining independence, after the further rapprochement of Homeland-Diaspora ties, the teaching of Armenian-Armenian in Armenia became more urgent, and its examination was based on science.
  Today, the issue of closer rapprochement and mutual enrichment of the two versions of our language sounds very urgent, the implementation of which should start from schools and relevant departments of universities.
The issue of teaching Armenian-Armenian became more urgent after the famous UNESCO publication, according to which Armenian-Armenian has been included in the list of endangered, endangered languages ​​since 20101¹.
In this case, the rapprochement of the two literary versions of the mother tongue and the comparative teaching are perceived as a patriotic step, outside of civic duty.
A brief study of the Armenian-Armenian literary language is included only in the high school humanities curriculum, while the teaching of Armenian-Armenian manuscripts begins in the 8th grade of high school and continues in all grades of high school.
 In this case, the study of Armenian-Armenian originals can simultaneously become a process of studying the Armenian-Armenian literary language.
The teaching of the Armenian language in the secondary school should be carried out in a practical way within the framework of the work on the original.
By using the comparison method, the similarities and differences between the two versions of the mother tongue become obvious, and the understanding of the linguistic features of the Armenian language becomes easier and more accessible.
Training can be carried out by both inductive and deductive methods.
In the first case, the learner, getting acquainted with the linguistic reality, finds its expression in the context of the original.
  In the second case, the learner interprets the linguistic realities by interpreting the Armenian-Armenian words և in the original.
As it is known, Eastern Armenian-Western Armenian literary languages ​​were formed on different dialectal bases.
  If the Ararat dialect served as the basis for Eastern Armenian, then the dialect of Constantinople for the Armenian-Armenian literary language.

This is the main reason for the phonetic, orthographic and grammatical differences between the two literary languages.
The main phonological differences between the two literary languages ​​are the movements of the consonants.
 In ArmArmenian, the vowels b, c, d, dz, j are pronounced as breathing deaf, p, q, t, ts, ch, and the simple deaf, p, k, t, ts, j, become vowels: b, c, d, ձ, ջ (with some exceptions), as beautiful - beautiful, Petros - Bedros և etc.
 In the pronunciation of ArmArmenian, the sound r is eliminated, և r-r is pronounced in the same way (aru-aru, aru-aru).
The pronunciation features of ArmArmenian will be more accessible by displaying the pronunciation of the studied originals.
 It is advisable to combine the original versions in Eastern Armenian and Western Armenian, especially if the teaching is combined with listening to recordings of works (read by Hrachya Nersisyan, Vahram Papazyan and other masters).
The night is sweet, the night is easy! With hashish perfume and balm. I cross the light road with wine. The night is sweet, the night is easy .... M. Metsarents, "Sirerg" The night is sweet, the night is easy! Hashish snake and palasan. I'm going to sleep on the way to Lushen, Kisher is sweet, Kisher is easy .... Then, practical exercises will be performed according to the original topics, such as: - Read the given words in Armenian-Armenian pronunciation1. Flower , փառք (փարք), ջոջ (չոչ).
1 The samples included in the assignments are selected from the works of the Armenian-Armenian authors included in the textbooks of the general education school (Gasparyan D., Literature, 8th grade, E., "Tigran Mets" publishing house, 2017, pp. 187-223.
 Kirakosyan V., Avetisyan Z., Literature, 11th grade, E., "Manmar" publishing house, 2010, pp. 15-109).
-Continue the series of pronouns, explaining the pronunciations: person - after, person - passed, front - bear, stream - male, nail - squeeze, silent - news, forward - sigh.

The next step in the linguistic work on the Armenian-Armenian originals is the verbal work.
Ar-Armenian է is the main vocabulary of Ar-Armenian literary languages, but there are words that are used only in Arm-Armenian.
Separating such words and explaining them in Eastern Armenian versions will not only help to "discover" the content of the literary work, but will also enrich the student's vocabulary.
Verbal work around the originals should be performed with the following tasks.
-Using R. From Sakapetoyan's dictionary, mention the Armenian-Armenian equivalents: (deep), akaghdzun (full), morning (morning), zakatel (longing), kalyak (drop), hambun (hamak), dumb (slow), easy (pleasant), memik ), πατάρον (lie), debtor (tired).

The acquaintance with the grammatical realities of the Armenian-Armenian language is made possible through practical training.
 Applying the teaching-deductive method, the students are first given an idea of ​​the grammatical features of the Armenian-Armenian language, and original works are applied.
It is known that the first feature of the distinction between Eastern Armenian and Western Armenian literary languages ​​(such as dialects) is the composition of the present tense of the verb's definite article (flows - flows, passes - passes).
  The student will know this linguistic reality by observing in the studied manuscripts, such as… A deep trembling flows through them…
   D. Varuzhan, "Tsoryan Seas"… And I pass through the sand with a trembling shore ...
  Մ. Metsarents, "Boats" in Eastern Armenian exceeds the conjugation of the noun, and in Ar-Armenian - the conjugation.
  In the plural, after the suffixes -er, -ner, the conjugation generally increases.
 On a road in the field, Or on the slope of the mountain… M. Metsarents, "Hyugh" Art is gold, Such flames… D. Varuzhan, "Mature Art" in Eastern Armenian is the main ending of the exceptional from, and in Western Armenian they are.
     On the road, and in the river, and in the field… Give me, Lord, the joy impersonal.
  Մ. Metsarents, in the singular syllable of "Give me, Lord" Eastern Armenian, the Armenian language does not have an ending. The meaning of the noun is expressed in connection.
My heart disappeared in the twilight… M. Metsarents, "Secondary" The sexual syllable never gets a decisive article in Eastern Armenian, it can get in real Armenian.
… In the valley of the valley of Aleta
Seas cross.
  D. Varuzhan, "Tsoryan Seas" During the formation of the plural, a series of words with և and's sounds, in contrast to Eastern Armenian, appear on a non-vowel basis.
… All fruits in autumn,
And honey, and milk, and wine.
  Մ. Metsarents, "Hyugh" has a pronoun instead of an indefinite article in Eastern Armenian.
In ArmArmenian there is an indefinite article, a postposition (with the vowel, m ', mn).
  A word of magic enchanted my heart…. P. Duryan, "To love" ... A little more, Ah, shine, shine, welcome! I'm sick.
  Մ. Metsarents, "Ar" "Ar" Armenian is characterized by double denial, which is never expressed in Ar-Armenian.
 Nobody said. "Huck boy, why is he yelling?" P. Duryan, "Lake" In Armenian, the direct problem has only one form - straight.
 I hate the lush women of the halls… D. Varuzhan, "Oh, Talita" After getting acquainted with the brief theory of grammar, practical works on the originals.
"Write out the grammatical forms typical of Armenian-Armenian from the original, comment on the linguistic reality.
- To write Eastern Armenian versions in front of Armenian-Armenian grammatical letters. P. Duryan, "My death" my soul, they say, in the fields, you feel, me, him, a flower, the women, my manchers, he came, showed it to him, he said, to me, to everyone.
- To turn the pre-Armenian grammatical horses into Arma-Armenian.
- Compare the Armenian-Armenian-Armenian originals, noting the grammatical differences. The fragrant breeze with flowers scents the fragrant breeze in the evening, A fragrant dream descends on the souls, How easy is the twilight of this night.
            Մ. Metsarents, "Under the Shine of the Acacias" Sheds quiet leaves from the flowers. The fragrant breeze with fragrances in the evening, A scent descends on the souls.
Thus, the patterns of the Armenian-Armenian language can be learned in Armenian literature classes as part of the work on the original.
 Students learn Western Armenian by combining Eastern Armenian and Western Armenian linguistic realities.
The commonalities and differences between the two literary languages ​​become obvious with the combination of Eastern Armenian and Western Armenian originals.
Knowledge of the Armenian-Armenian literary language contributes to the comprehension of the content of the literary work and the discovery of artistic merits.
Studying the Armenian language is a patriotic step in the realization of the civic duty.
