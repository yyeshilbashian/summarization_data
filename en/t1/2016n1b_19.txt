 It helps the learnerthe development of independent thinking and creativity.
To develop children's abilities and skillsThe correct methods of teaching are importantthe choice.
 The student is gaining knowledge from the teacher todayto report.
"In this sense, it is necessary to be a geography teacherPrepare each lesson thoroughly, because the studentThe mastery of the software material by it is largely conditioned by thatthe quality of the transmitter.
  The success of geography lessonslargely depends on the equipment on which the teacher is to workdays and months ago.
 These are not just maps, but manyvarious exhibition materials ”[1 page 26].
To develop learners' abilities and skillsis important in teachingchoice of methods.
  Part of the interest in learningcan also be supplemented by the use of interesting educational material,as it helps to increase the efficiency of the class.
The scientific-pedagogical experiment was carried out in M. 29 Mashtots Ave.
in 7a, 6b ,, և 4b grades of the basic school. The goal was to present
Ways to increase class effectiveness in geographyduring teaching.
6th grade - 16 students with low progress.
 The lesson is donewith a new method.
 The "Mosaic" method was used.
 The topic of the lesson was "SouthernGeographical:Location:The line.
Flushing the shoresthe oceansSOUTHAMERICAArea:Earthquakes,current և extinctvolcanoesIn the AndesPlain eastMountainouswest!America, geographical location, border, surface. "
 The points set aside for the lesson study were written on the board beforehandwith the following scheme.
The first stage of the lesson is "promotion".
 Implemented during this phaseActivation of students: information on the topicby remembering.
  This forces learners to take examsown knowledge ել at the same time think about the main topic.
The brainstorming revealed the students' knowledge baseDiscovery of the Americas by F. Magellan SouthAbout the history of bypassing America from the south.
The class did not perform well, so students had difficulty remembering geographical objects.the names.
 The map shows the large straits, valleys, plateaus, and mountains of the continent under study, saying their names, and the students, trying to memorize difficult names,Together with the teacher they pronounced them aloud։ signed on the outline map.
The next stage of the lesson is the perception of meaning.
 As mentioned above, electedis the "mosaic" method.
  According to that method, the class was divided into 4 groups.
For example, the numbers of groups 1 are gathered around one table, 2, 3, 4 are gathered around other tables.
First the class was instructed to read the lesson material.
  Then!Leaflets were distributed to the groups, on which it was written that the groupWhich side of the question should he represent?
Each member of the group was selected as a sub-theme expert.which will teach the members of the other groups its sub-theme.
 15 minutes were giventime.
 After graduation, the results were summarized.
1st group• Geographical location• South American territory, the tip• Africa և Hv. Differences in America's geographical location
The 2nd group• The line• Coast drawing• Coastal oceans3rd group• Surface:• Mountain West!• Plain east4th group• Earthquakes• Active volcanoes in the Andes.
Each group presented its work.
For example, the first group analyzed Hv. Geographical America
, Compare the area, the extremities հետ with the geographical location of Africa.
Then all the groups presented their works.
 Clarifications were given to the incomprehensible questions.
  Each expert tried to teach the other members of the group his sub-theme.
  HoweverThe students had a hard time completing this task.
 Then:They were able to work on a sketch by collaborating in a groupon the map.
The usefulness of the method was found out during the weighing stage.
  The result became obvious when the GUS method was used.
 This writing assignment was given to the whole class on a spreadsheetto complete the questions.
I knowI would like to knowI learnedIt took 5 minutes.
 After graduation, the results were summarized.
  In the process, the outline of 8 students was checked and evaluatedMap works և Completed questions in the GUS table.
As a result, it turned out that some of the students did not master the new welllesson.
7a grade - 16 students with average progress.
 Topic: "Allocation of the world's natural resources".
 In this class և by usThe "mosaic" method was used.
In the first stage of the lesson, students were tested by a brainstorming sessionknowledge of natural resources.
 The words were written on the board.
 Then he was instructed to read the new lesson.
At the stage of understanding the meaning, the class was divided into four peoplegroups.
  The groups were given handouts on which to discusstasks.
Each group was instructed to study and analyze the section for them in the defined period.
Groups of four people worked on the given parts.Group 1 - "Land resources" sector,Group 2 - "water resources" sector,Group 3 - "Mineral resources"The 4th group - the section "Global Ocean Resources".
Upon expiration of the time allotted for the given worksThen each group presented their work.
  Then the children returned to their groups, each teaching the other members of the group the part of the lesson they had mastered.
At the reflection stage, the groups told the lesson.
  The "Questions" included at the end of the lesson was used to determine the degree of masteryTasks "section.
As a result, 8 students were evaluated who were able to:classify natural resources according to origin, shown on the mapThe most important mines և explained the concept of "natural resource".
 That is, they overcame the minimum A and B average levels.
The other is 4b with 24 high-achieving studentsIt was the class where this method was used.
  The topic was "The Discovery of America".
Potatoes, cigarettes, cotton, tomatoes, coffee, peppers were put on the table.Pictures of horses և etc.
  The question is, which of these items are there?imported from America to Europe, which, on the contrary.
  First, the blackboard was divided into two parts.
  "America" ​​was written in one column and "America" ​​in the other."Europe".
  After thinking for two minutes, the students chose from the above items the ones they thought had been imported from Europe.They wrote under the word "Europe" and the rest under the word "America".
At the stage of understanding the meaning, it was instructed to read the material silently.
Again the class was divided into groups, this time into 6 groups, 4 students in each.
During the weigh-in phase, the whole lesson was told by my choice.
 As a result, all the members of the group learned the lesson.
 To be sureto see if they have mastered the lesson, run at the end of the lessonquestions.
  They were able to explain the impact of early travel on human development, such as:Explain the motives for traveling around the world.
12 students were evaluated.
In other words, we were already able to reach the maximum C in 4b gradelevel.
Conclusion. So we can say that every lesson has
The nature of his approach, depending on the complexity of the material, the studentsabilities.
Used in selected topics in the "Perception of Meaning" phasemainly the "Mosaic" method.
 As a result, by helping each other, all the members of the group learned the lesson.
  Such a method is possibleto teach educational materials on the same topic with different content components.
Suggestion. 1. In low-grade classes
read the educational material aloud in separate sections andDiscuss with the help of a teacher.
2. Teaching in 50% արան higher grade classes can be organized in "Mosaic" or "Tour"in the gallery "method.
3. To achieve good results at the beginning of each topicLearners need to be introduced to the study of new materialrequirements set aside for.
  Can be used for mappingmethod.
In general, the effectiveness of trainingIn order to improve it is necessary to apply new methods և tricks.
