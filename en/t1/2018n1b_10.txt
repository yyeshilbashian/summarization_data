Timeliness.
 Our republic is not left out of the socio-economic changes taking place all over the world, which constantly presents new requirements to the theory of pedagogy-practice.
 Even today, one of the problems of school education is the creation of positive motivations for learning, which refers to the subject of physical education.
A number of authors, M.A. Arvisto [1], V.K. Balschich [2], VI Zholdak [3], V.A. Sokolova [4], OS Farfel [5], E.P. Sherbakova [6], the study of scientific works shows that the development of schoolchildren's physical-sports interest remains one of the problems of schoolchildren's physical education.
  This is due to the worrying situation created in recent years. Deterioration of the level of health and physical fitness of preschool children is observed, low level of positive motivations for physical culture, sports, healthy lifestyle.
  The study of motivations for physical culture is a necessary condition for the organization of physical education for schoolchildren and the management of their physical education process.
The purpose of the research.
  Determine the ways in which junior high school students develop an interest in physical education classes.
The research was carried out in Hrazdan city N 5 basic school after Hovhannes Tumanyan.
 79 students in the third and fourth grades will be included in the research.
 A questionnaire was developed for the release of the detainee, an individual interview was conducted with the help of the teacher.
As a result of the analysis of the obtained data, we got the following image.
 The majority of respondents (86%) mentioned that they gladly participate in physical education classes.
Although physical education lessons differ from other subjects in their emotionality, their ability to move freely during the lesson, and other positive aspects, in our opinion, such an answer is declarative in nature, as evidenced by the answers to the following question.
 If they had a choice, 30.3% of the students answered that they did not participate in physical education classes.
  For this period of age development, such an attitude contradicts the natural need of children to move.
 The roots of such a contradiction may lie in the organizational and methodological problems of physical education classes.
The students' attitude towards physical education classes was clearly expressed in the answers to the question "Are you absent from physical education classes?" - Figure 1.
             Figure 1. Students' absence from physical education classes About 60% of students try not to miss physical education classes, which may indicate that they wanted to be objective; they linked unique absences to illness or other causes.
 It can be mentioned that the schoolchildren who answered in this way show a rather stable interest in the physical education class.
 Schoolchildren's indifference or complete lack of interest in physical education classes is reflected in the answer "I often miss physical education classes."
 16.4% of the respondents answered that they often miss physical education classes, citing good reasons. "I forget my uniform", "I do not feel well", "it hurts somewhere".
The next question, "What do you not like about physical education?", Aimed to find out the factors that prevent you from actively participating in physical education classes.
  The schoolchildren mentioned a number of negative aspects, which can be attributed to the methodology of conducting physical education classes, to the content of the program, to the organization of the educational process - Figure 2.
Figure 2. Factors hindering active participation in physical education classes 30.3% of the respondents mentioned that they get very tired during physical education classes, that is, they do not like physical activity.
  The majority of respondents, 20 students or 25.3%, were girls.
 31.6%, on the contrary, stated that they do not move much during the physical education class, that is, the physical loads are small.
  It is interesting to note that almost the same percentage of schoolchildren who chose the answer "we move less" - 32.9 - attend various sports groups: judo, karate, football, field hockey, boxing, dance, for which the physical activity is probably small.
 62% of schoolchildren '"dissatisfaction" with both large and small physical activity classes in physical education classes may indicate a mismatch between the physical activity of schoolchildren and the non-implementation of the principle of individual approach.
 22.7% of the respondents mentioned that they are not interested in physical culture, which, of course, is quite an unfavorable phenomenon, it requires revealing the causes and immediate correction.
 Such a situation may be due to their low level of theoretical knowledge of the subject "Physical Culture" բաց lack of purposefulness.
It was gratifying that the schoolchildren are quite clear in their interests, they understand what kind of exercises they want to do.
 48.1% of them mentioned that there are few competitions in physical education classes, and 44.3% said that there are few games.
As a result of the survey, it was possible to find out what attracts them to physical education classes - Figure 3.
 Of the answers to this question, most schoolchildren chose "free movement" - 62%, և physical exercises - 49.3%, which can be considered normal due to their natural need to move.
  One can separately emphasize the desire of the surveyed schoolchildren to compete - 40.5%.
Figure 3. Physical activity preferred by students in physical education classes The meaning of engaging in physical culture and sports is closely related to the individual significance of these lessons for each student.
  Students choose motivation based on meaning It's very likely that these motivations stem from the goals of physical education.
Based on this, it was possible to find out whether the children do physical exercises on their own and for what reasons.
 The polls showed that only 34.1% of the respondents perform physical exercises independently.
  This indicator almost coincides with the number of children attending sports or dance clubs.
It can be assumed that independent physical exercises are perfected by children's coaches.
 As motivations, the respondents chose the options "I just want" »" to be healthy ", respectively, 22.7 և 13.9%.
  The other incentives were less percentage: Figure 4.
Figure 4. Motivations for self-exercise with physical exercises Here are some observations: In our opinion, the "I just want to do it" option is motivated by the child's natural need to move, and the "to be healthy" option can be considered as a motivation.
As a result of the survey, the factors hindering the performance of independent physical exercises were found out, see Figure 5.
 As a hindering factor, the respondents mentioned the large number of classes - 35.4%, բաց lack of desire - 20.2%.
 The latter is a very serious signal և requires clear measures to change the attitude of these children towards physical culture.
Figure 5. Factors that hinder physical activity. To find out the factors that influence children's motivation, they were asked to answer the question of who or what motivates you to exercise.
 Coaches have more influence in this issue - 32.9%, parents - 26.5% և spontaneous desire of children - 27.8%.
Thus, the conducted research allows to make a series of conclusions.
  The development of interest in physical culture among primary school students can be carried out by influencing individual motivations վրա the motivational sphere as a whole.
 However, everything is interconnected in the motivational sphere of schoolchildren. When some motives are created, others are directly influenced and formed.
  Based on this, the influence of both individual motives and the complex impact on the motivational sphere as a whole is pedagogically justified during the targeted pursuit of interest in physical culture.
  For example, the successful formation of learning cognitive motivations is achieved through learning awareness and the development of motor skills.
  Creating productive motivations is a necessary condition for arousing active, sustainable interest in physical culture among schoolchildren.
 Without the orientation of the result, the motor activity of the schoolchildren is not effective, both in terms of active interest and the physical and technical training of the schoolchildren.
  The specific level of the result depends on the school age, the level of physical fitness.
 It can be the result of a game, a sport game, the educational standard, the result of a competition, specific indicators in movement tests, etc.
Effective motivations need to be found in the process of learning motor skills as well.
 Therefore, during physical education classes, it is necessary to include competitive activities of individual importance for each student, when schoolchildren, while studying, at the same time prepare to participate in a competition held in a given class or school.
 But here, too, a certain individually achievable result must be defined for each student, which must be evaluated by the teacher, classmates as success և self-overcoming step.
 In this case, there will be an internal motivation to train with physical exercises, which determines the interest of schoolchildren in physical culture.
The analysis of the results of the survey, our observations made of physical education lessons, the fact that at different stages of children's development, new motivations for physical culture appear, suggest that physical culture is ultimately cognitive, leading to cognitive which can be developed by constantly increasing the level of theoretical knowledge of physical education, sports, hygiene, healthy lifestyle of their primary school children.
