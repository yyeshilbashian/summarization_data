It is known that snake bites are often accompanied by severe, if not fatal, damage to various organs, particularly the liver and kidneys.
  That is why snake bites are dangerous not only for the tropics, but also for the inhabitants of developed countries (Warrellal., 2013).
Venomous snake venom (Viperidae) has a number of properties that accelerate the passage of toxins to the blood vessels of the lymph after the bite, spreading throughout the body, infecting various organ systems (Panfoli I. et al., 2010; Grazyna F. et al., 2007).
It is known that in case of various poisonings, the kidneys are more "damaged" compared to other organs.
 This is due to the fact that the kidneys are a unique filter that cleans the blood of harmful substances.
  The exception is the poison of the kidneys, the symptoms of which include adrenal insufficiency (Orlov BN et al., 1990).
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to find out the effect of Macrovipera lebetinaobtusa venom on the structure of the kidney և capillary network.
 The image of the injuries will allow to orientate what pathological processes take place in the nephron ժամանակ during poisoning around it, for the development of further antitoxic drugs.
Material և methodology. The experiments were performed on laboratory male white rats weighing 200-250 g.
 The experimental animals were divided into two groups, with six animals in each group.
The first group was a control, the animals of the second group were injected with a poisonous 2.5 MCH 50 at a dose of 5 mg / kg.
 After one injection, the animals were put to sleep with nembutal (n / o route) 40 mg / kg and the kidneys were removed.
 The kidneys were placed in 5% formalin, post-processing and preparation of the preparations was done by histochemical method (Chilingaryan GM et al., 1986).
  Kidney microscopy was performed using digital eyepiece (ocular) FMA050AmScope UCMOS09000KPB with x 6 և х20 lenses.
Research results. Since gyurza venom is a typical hemotropic venom (Orlov BN et al., 1990), ie it affects the circulatory system, it was initially assumed that the kidneys should also be affected by the Malpighian coil.
 However, the obtained results have a different picture.
 As can be seen from Figure 1, the renal vessels are only partially damaged.
Instead, tissue injuries are observed.
 Compared with the preparations obtained from the animals of the control group, the images of the poisoned preparations can be seen in the destruction of the tissue.
 The most pronounced decay was Bowman's capsules, which were torn, torn, and fused in place.
 The fact that the renal vessels were not damaged by the effects of anticoagulant poison may be related to the structural features of the vessels in the various organs, in particular the renal capillaries are known to have fenestrae (windows) which release high molecular weight P (67) et al., 1996).
  Because the most destructive components of gyuric acid, metalloproteinase PI (23 kDa), phospholipase A2 (13-16 kDa monomers և 26-32 kDa), ունեն others have much lower molecular weights, so on the basal membrane.
 Decomposition of the Shumlyansky-Bowman capsule under the influence of hemorrhagic venom has been described in a number of other studies (Soe S. et al., 1993; Chaiyabutr N. etal., 1999).

Conclusion.
  Thus, it can be concluded from the obtained results that the poison of the Caucasian Gyurza, when acting on the kidneys, disrupts the work of the nephrons, damaging the structural integrity of the Bowman's cavity, as a result of which it causes kidney failure.
  As a result, the kidneys are unable to perform their function, and the venom remains in the tissues, continuing its destructive activity.
 Based on the resulting image, it is necessary to obtain an antitoxic agent, which should be a low-molecular-weight mobile compound, the absorption of which will be rapid, to ensure timely protection of epithelial cells.
 Taurine, quercetin and similar physiologically active substances may be candidates for this type of substance, and research is underway.
