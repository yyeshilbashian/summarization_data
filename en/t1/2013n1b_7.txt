Suicide is currently a global social issue.
  It is studied by a number of sciences: law, social sciences, psychology, ethics.
  This article addresses the psychological aspects of suicide prevention.
  Almost every five minutes someone loses his life.
  Most troubling is the fact that the number of suicides among 15-24 year olds has tripled in the last 30 years [2; 3; 4].
 In our country in 2011 Suicide attempt cases in 2010 increased by 9.4% compared to the previous year, amounting to 647 cases [1].
  As a result, suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people (accidents are the number one cause of death).
  Suicides can be mentioned for various reasons: avoiding pain or mental stress, directing aggression towards oneself, a means of punishing loved ones through guilt, with the influence of momentary illogical emotions և impulses.
  Suicides are committed by single people.
 They often suffer from "tunnel vision" when they think that suicide is the only way to overcome the problem.
 The unfortunate thing is that the problems are temporary and the suicide is irreparable.
There are many myths about suicides that can be trusted to lose a person.
 The most common misconception is that people who are mentally abnormal commit suicide.
 It is also widely believed that there is a specific psychological type of person who is prone to suicide.
However, anyone can end his life, regardless of his psychological type.
 Another misconception is that if a person decides to commit suicide, he will definitely do it.
 In a crisis situation, a person really feels the need for mental support, emotional warmth, compassion.
 However, the desire to commit suicide may be temporary.
 The next misconception is that "people who talk about suicide will never do it."
  Contrary to popular belief, the majority of suicides indicate their plans directly or indirectly after death.
 The ability to discuss their intentions helps people who are overcoming dangerous intentions to know where to turn for help.
Most people who commit suicide try to get attention in one way or another.
  Signs of impending suicide may be: 1. expression of suicidal thoughts, 2. Previous suicide attempts, 3. Depression experienced by unhappy love, 4. Despair caused by chronic illness, educational or work failures; 5. obvious personal changes, 6. use of alcohol or drugs, 7. feeling helpless, 8. Changing habits.

 It is necessary to remember that every threat of suicide must be taken seriously.
  The cry for help is hidden under the usual complex.
 If you notice something unusual, alarming in the behavior of your relatives or friends, try to get them professional help.
 The first thing to do is to take that person to a psychologist or psychotherapist.
  If he refuses to go to a specialist, he should be helped to express his feelings, to show sincere compassion and care.
  You can offer to consider other ways to solve this problem.
It is also necessary to find out whether there is a specific plan to commit suicide.
  If such a plan exists, the situation becomes more dangerous.
 If the person has chosen the place of suicide, the weather, the means, it indicates that the last step is very close.
  If he persistently refuses to approach the specialist, make an appointment for the next meeting.
 During that time you can get advice from a specialist.
  A person who wants to commit suicide needs to inspire confidence in his / her personal merits, because he / she needs those around him / her.
His support can save his life.
Suicide prevention can solve various problems. Control of access to various means of autoaggression ափ restriction, control of risk group և factors, provision of medical and psychological assistance.
  R. Kochyunas presents the rules of psychological counseling for people who intend to commit suicide.1. meet them often 2. Emphasize the positive aspects of their lives, 3. There is no need to panic, try to hide that feeling by telling the visitor about the moral norms of inadmissibility of suicide, 4.

Psychological help is especially important for people with severe suicidal ideation, the vast majority of whom are healthy.
  The main purpose of emergency care is to prevent further development of և suicide.
  It is necessary to help the person to master the situation, as well as to correct և correct non-adaptive personal attitudes, which lead to the development of crisis situations, suicidal tendencies.
  We must assume that the crisis is not so much a consequence of the circumstances as a negative attitude towards it, as a consequence of which the traumatic situation is considered to be a stable phenomenon.
The urgent steps of crisis prevention are: 1. The conversation.
  The first step in preventing suicide is to establish personal contact and gain trust.
 Suicidal people are often in a state of psychosis (unbearable mental pain), their consciousness is impaired, so talking to someone else can reduce the level of anxiety.
  The most important thing in this situation is to be able to listen.
  It is necessary to encourage the open expression of thoughts and feelings with the help of empathy, reducing tension.
  At this stage, it is also necessary to conduct an assessment of the circumstances and the degree of risk of suicide.
  If true, the conversation should be aimed at delaying the decision to commit suicide.
2. Conscious possession of the situation.
  With the help of special questions, assertions, it is necessary to overcome the feeling of an exceptional, insurmountable situation.
 The severity of feelings can be reduced by focusing on previous achievements and successes.
  At this stage, it is possible to use such methods as the expression of emotions, the expression of suicidal feelings, the search for sources of emotions.
3. Approval of the agreement.
  The next step is to solve the problem behind the suicide activity.
 However, in no case can this problem be reduced in the eyes of the person, but on the contrary, try to divide it into parts and give their solutions separately.
 At this stage, it is possible to help the suicidal person find alternative ways to solve the problem.
  The main ways of working are to put forward hypotheses for resolving the situation, to formulate a certain plan, to keep silent in order to stimulate the initiative of the person, to give time for the elaboration of the plan.
4. Active psychological support բարձր increase self-confidence.
The leading methods of this stage are persuasion, inspiration, activation of personal resources.
 The last, final step is the inspiration that the person will definitely overcome the problem.
5. Search for resources to overcome the crisis situation.
Such resources can be family, professional activities, close people, the realization of dreams.
 It is possible to speak freely with such a person, so that he does not feel in the role of the interrogated.
 At this stage it is necessary to outline several ways of overcoming the crisis situation, but in no case should your opinion be dictated to him.
In the end, it should be discussed how the overcoming of this situation will be useful for overcoming new difficulties in the future.
As a result of the listed activities, the person must make sure that: 1. difficult emotional states are temporary վեն will change during therapy, 2. others in similar situations also felt so bad, and then their condition was completely restored, 3. He is strong for his relatives and friends, and it will be very difficult for them to get out of life.
In the extreme case, he can be persuaded that everyone has the right to control his life freely, but that possible questioning can be postponed for a few days or weeks so that he can weigh everything later.
  Working with such people can be especially gentle, respecting a person's right to freedom of choice, but also reminding others that they have the right to help them reconsider their decision.
After the crisis assistance, it is expedient to organize further work using different therapeutic methods: cognitive psychotherapy, speech therapy, axiopsychotherapy, art therapy.
The first approach to solving this problem is to increase public attention, to find ways to prevent it.
 In many cities, there are crisis centers around the clock. to get consent.
  We think that it is time to create psychological telephone "hotlines" in our city as well, in the center of which, in addition to psychological violence, there will be various psychological issues, problems, including the early prevention of suicides.
V. The satirist mentions. "Problems will always be with us.
 The problem is not a problem in itself, the problem is how a person overcomes it.
 This is what has a negative impact on people.
 If we learn to deal with the problem differently, then the problems will become different. "[8]
