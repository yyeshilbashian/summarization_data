At the current stage of development of the RA economy, one of the most important issues is the activation of the investment process in the country, whichThe solution is a possible precondition for further economic stabilityto ensure economic growth.
  In the current situation, it is very important to evaluate the effectiveness of investmentsthe issue of decision making.
 The timing of the receipt of the invested funds, the prospects for the development of the enterprise depend on the accuracy of such an assessment, the credibility.
 Along with the improvement of market economic conditions, Armenian companies need to introduce modern management methods aimed at increasing their competitiveness ևmodels.
  Achieving the long-term goals of companies ևThe efficiency of investment management is of special importance for sustainable development.
  Investment:The projects allow the companies to develop new products, carry out technical upgrades of production, improve production processes, create competitive advantages, improve the quality of products for sale, strengthen their own market position.
  In practice, the extreme complexity of investment decision-making due to the long-term use of capital, the uncertainty of the results of investment projectsto a high degree, with a complex nature of investment processes;puts the limited finances of the company with particular severity,efficiency of human և use of material resourcesThe need to develop a comprehensive management system for investment projects aimed at maximization.
  Moreover, thisThe problem is even more pressing for small and medium-sized enterprises, as they have smaller reserves to eliminate the consequences of wrong investment decisions compared to larger companies.
  The evaluation of the effectiveness of the investment project endsin absolute և relative terms to determine its level of profitability.
  Evaluating the effectiveness of investment projectsA number of quantitative and qualitative indicators are used for this purpose.
The following system of correlated indicators is most often used for this purpose: [1] 1. net income (NI),2. net discounted income (NDI) or, as:it is also called an integral product,3. net present value (NPV);4. profitability index (PI);5. Internal rate of return (IRR);6. payback period (PP);7. Investment efficiency ratio (ARR).
We have evaluated the effectiveness of the investment program of "Ani" LLC with the above-mentioned indicators.
"Ani" LLC is engaged in the production of bricks and other construction materials.
 The company currently produces 15 productsname, which includes 10 types of bricks, paints, cement lightblocks, cell glass և other materials.
"Ani" LLC wants to implement a business planInvest in own և external financingwith involvement.
The sources of funds for the implementation of the business plan are as follows:  1. Long-term loans,  2. own contribution.
Long-term loans are provided for equipmentհամար To attract working capital for production.
500.5 million AMD is envisaged for long-term loans5with an annual interest rate of 14% with a maturity of one year
 The credit means will be directed to the expansion and development of the production of brick and other products.
  As a result of attracting investmentsIt will be possible to increase sales in the local market, as well as to organize exports.
The Company's investments will also be directed to current մասն partial reimbursement of working capital costs և currentin the direction of realization of expenses.
 The company's own investmentsThe amount is 308 million AMD.
The projected turnover of the company will be sufficient to ensure the repayment of loans, return on external financial resources and profitability.
The return on investment is planned to be realized in five years.
 The repayment period of the borrowed capital is chosen on the principle that the working capital is directed to the gradual increase of production capacities, the replenishment of working capital, the partial satisfaction of the market demand for the product, as a result of which it will be possible to direct the means to the production.

So, based on the indicators mentioned in the business plan, let's calculate whether:How long will it take for the initial investment to be repaid, ie the simple investment repayment period - PP? Cash flow in the first year amounted to 90,200,000, which is less than the initial investment, in the first year քերը Cash flow amounted toIn I, II և III year: 490,700,000 + 481,434,000 = 972,134,000  Investments will return in less than 3 years (but keep in mind that:The simple investment repayment period does not take into account moneyvalue fluctuations).
Balance = 1-972134000-808500000 / 481434000 = 0.66It turns out that the Payback period is 2.66 years.
     And if we take into account the discounting of fundsvalue, then we have to calculate another indicator - DPP (discount period of compensation).
    Before calculating this indicator, calculate the current value of investments (PV)Let's count the year when the initial investments will be repaid.In և II year 79122807 + 308077000 = 387199807 <808500000I, II և III year 387199807 + 320956000 = 708155807 <808500000I, II, III և IV year 708155807 + 265161810 = 973317617> 808500000This means that the initial investments will return in 4 years.
If we assume that the cash flow is equal for the whole period, we can calculate the balance of the fourth year.Balance = 1-973317617-808500000 / 265161810 = 0.378As we can see, the investment pays off in 3,378 years(DPP = 3.378), which is longer than in the case of a simple compensation period.
Now calculate the net present value of the investment project (NPV).
To do this, we use the current values ​​(PV) already calculated for each year.
 How do we know?       According to our calculations, the current values ​​of the project will be equal.For the first year: PV1 = 79122807For the second year: PV2 = 308077000For the third year: PV3 = 320956000For the fourth year: PV4 = 265161810For the fifth year: PV5 = 290435576, after receiving ևIt is effective to invest in this project.
    For this project, let's count the profitability discountindex (DPI).
  This indicator indicates that investments in the projectDoing so is effective.
The internal rate of return is the discount rate at which NPV = 0.
 It is impossible to determine the IRR in the form of a formula, thisThe index is determined by sampling.
 Let's make the following table.The volume of initial investments in the table is 808.5 million AMD, the discount rate is 14%.
 In this case NPV = 455 million, which is greater than 0, but we need to apply a discount rate in which caseThe net present value is equal to 0.
  Arbitrarily assume that the discount rate is 30%, in which case NPV = 48.95 million AMD, andIf we accept the discount rate of 40%, then NPV = -114.59 million drams.
Then the discount rate at which NPV = 0,is in the range of 30 և 40 percent.
 In this case, we calculate the IRR.         That is, IRR = 33%, it is the maximum limit after which the investment program will be unprofitable.
 Until then, it will be profitable for the enterprise to finance the given investment project.
It should be noted that it should be taken into account in the evaluation of the investment projectTake the financial dependency ratio, which shows the firm dependence on foreign loans.
  The calculation scheme assumes the ratio of borrowed funds և total assets.
 The higher the index, the larger the share of borrowed funds, which indicates insolvency.high risk մասին about cash deficit in the enterprise.
The financial dependency ratio specified in the organizationis equal to 0.619 or 62%.
 This proves that 62% of the credit for the implementation of the business plan are the means, and the remaining 38% are own.
 This is a normal indicator for implementing such a business project,as it is generally accepted that the share of own funds in total assets should exceed 25%.
 And in the organization itis equal to 38%.
  Then the investment project can be implemented.
Conclusion. Investment project performance evaluation indicators, despite their potential practical significance,
They have significant shortcomings.
  Thus, they are mainly partialտնտեսական The economic efficiency of investment projectsdescribe it from one point of view.
 That's why projectsFor a more comprehensive assessment, it is necessary to consider these indicators as a systemic whole, each component of which tries to supplement the results of the use of the others.the gap.
 However, even if all the observed indicators are usedIt is impossible to avoid serious complications.
  So because they areThey are different in nature, so their values ​​can create the opposite picture.
 In this case, the problem of giving preference to one of the indicators arises, which, although very often solved in favor of NPV, but in our opinion, this solution is "incomplete" and does not have sufficient justification.
