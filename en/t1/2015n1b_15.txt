Various books on fascinating mathematics often ask problems for determining the shortest paths through the surfaces of polynomials or different spatial bodies, which are sometimesare called "Ant-spider" or "Locust-spider" problems.
Why are these problems called insects?
There are several main reasons.1. To make it more interesting and understandable.
2. It is more convenient to consider these insects as a material point.
3. Insects can move freely in different sessions of the polynomial.
This paper not only addresses the problems of determining the simplest classical shortest paths, but also considers the mostproblems of a general nature.
In our work we have tried to make possible interesting generalizations և to consider practical problems.
The first section looks at the most proposed in various geometry textbooks և fascinating math textbookssimple problems.
  Used to solve similar problems the following method.It is necessary to depict the different spans of spatial bodies և to find the shortest path connecting the given two points smoothlyon the stretch.
       In the second and third sections, more serious and general problems are considered, when it is necessary to consider different stretches.In some cases, the shortest path is not always obtained by sitting.
The cases of all possible arrangements on the locust և spider's face-to-face sessions were observed դեպքում in each casethe shortest paths by observing the corresponding stretches.
The work is interesting, instructive for both schoolchildren and teachers և architects, it is necessary even if simpleIn such cases, make a comprehensive analysis և observepositions of possible different extensions.
I. In this section we will study in textbooks և fascinatingThe simplest, most introductory set in the problem booksproblem groups.
Problem 1.1 [1] Find the shortest unit area of ​​a cubethe length of the path that connects the opposite vertices of the cube (Fig. 1).
Figure 1:Solution.
 Because with each session the roadshave the same length, so it is enough to show that the cube is stretched in pairs, in each case the shortest path is obtained.with adjacent sessions (Fig. 2).
For example, կարճ the shortest way to cross side 1 would be ․𝐴𝐶1 = √4 + 1 = √5.

The following cases are possible:If 4𝛼 <1800, ie 𝛼 <450, then 𝐴𝐴1
If 𝛼 = 450, then 𝐴𝐴1 = 2𝑏.
If 𝛼> 450, then the shortest path of the surface is 2𝑏,since հարթ1 does not intersect the side of the pyramid in a flat stretch area.
Answer: if 𝛼 <450, then the shortest path is 2𝑏𝑠𝑖𝑛2𝛼,               if ≥ ≥ 450, then the shortest way is 2𝑏.

  Draw the lateral surface of the cylinder (Fig. 5) ևTo find the shortest path, connect points A և B of the stretchin a straight line.
If 𝑥 <𝜋𝑟, then the shortest path is obtained                                                                      Figure 5:𝑙short = 𝐴𝐵 = √ℎ2 + 𝑥2.
If 𝑥 = 𝜋𝑟, then 𝐴𝐵 = 𝐴′𝐵 = 𝑙short = √ℎ2 + 𝜋2𝑟2.
If 𝑥> 𝜋𝑟, then the shortest path is obtained                                   𝑙short = 𝐴′𝐵 = √ℎ2 + (2𝜋𝑟 - 𝑥) 2.

Solution.
  That is, the spider և the ant are sitting in a rectangleon opposite peaks.
The shortest possible routes cross the FG rib, or the DF rib, or EG rib, each of which intersects The shortest routes will be:1 ․ Via FG (Fig. 7)

3 ․ If c> a և c> b, then the shortest path will be։.
That is, the shortest path will cross the longest side.
II. Most surprising are the problems in which the shortest path is obtained not in the span of two adjacent sessions, but in three adjacent ones.
by bypassing the sessions.
These problems are more common, how can they be done?affordable but at the same time interesting privatizationas well as various generalizations.
In this section, we will look at two main problem classes: from the private (input) problem to all possible generalizations.1 ․ When the points belong to the opposite sides of the cube, then:
We generalize in the case of a rectangle.
2 ․ When one of the points belongs to one of the cubes and the other
which side of the opposite session, we generalize in the case of a rectangle.

Problem 3.2 Given a cube 𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐷𝐴1𝐵1𝐶1𝐷1 with AB և BC on the sides K և𝐴𝐵.
  Find the position of point MThe points L are chosen so that 𝐵𝐾 = 𝐶𝐿 =
On the plane 𝐴1𝐵1𝐶1𝐷1, the shortest path is from M to Kis equal to the shortest path from M to L (Fig. 15).
Fig. 15:
Solution.
 To shorten the path connecting the points K ով M with a basket A1B1Find, draw the cube ABA1B1The extension of the seats A1B1C1D1 so that they lie in the same plane ¥ The extension given in Fig. 16 is shown in soliddotted և dots are also shownThey are like a cube. "
Figure 16:The shortest way to cross the side of A1B1 will be MK.
  In order to:to find the shortest path intersecting the ribs BB1 և B1C1, we need another waydepict the spread.
 The picture shows the dots marked with dotted lineswith barcodes.
 And finally, to find the intersecting sides of AA1 և A1D1The shortest path, you have to depict this stretch with dotted linesdots with double barcodes.
  Therefore, the shortest path connecting the points M և K to the surface of the cube will be one of MK, K / M, K // M.
The perpendicular bisector of K / K passes through point B1 և intersects D1C1 such that Eto the point that: .
Thus, if point M is inside triangle EC1B1, then MK /will be the shortest distance.
  In the same way is the point F of KK //with a median dividing D1C1 by 1.
In 5 ratios.
 If the point M:is inside the triangle A1D1F, then MK // will be the shortest distance.
 In other cases, MK is the smallest.
Consider the points L, L /, L // և U, V in the same way by dividing it by A1D11.

In 5 ratios.
Fig ․17Thus A1B1C1D1 was divided into 8 parts, for each of themThe shortest path to the cube surface is easily locatedconnecting point M to points K և L.
 For HNOB1, the lengths of these paths are approximately equal to MK և ML.
 Therefore, if M is inside HNOB1 և belongs to the search pointsgeometrically, then belongs to the KL's orthogonal.
In the same way, the geometric location of the points sought in OC1B1 is the median of LK /.
 Now we can construct the geometric position of the points M so that the area of ​​the cube connecting the points M և K is the shortest path equal to the area of ​​the cube connecting the points M և Lon the shortest path (PQ perpendicular to KL /, QR to KL, RSKL /, ST is K // L /).
Problem 3.3 Given on the side AB of 𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐷𝐴1𝐵1𝐶1𝐷1 cube M և 𝐴1𝐵1𝐶1𝐷1N points on the session (Fig. 18).
  Find the area of ​​the cube M և NThe shortest way to connect the dots.
Solution.
 You need a cube for thatdraw on the plane with 3 eggs (Fig. 19).
It can be taken from point N to a plane parallel to 𝐴𝐴1𝐵𝐵1, which 𝐴1𝐵1, 𝐶1𝐵1,
Will cross sections 𝐴𝐷, երում at points 𝐷3, 𝐶3, 𝐷2, 𝐶2 respectively և solve the problemFor 𝐴𝐴1𝐵𝐵1𝐷3𝐶3𝐷2𝐶2 (as the road will not pass through 𝐷3𝐶3𝐷2𝐶2).
Fig. :18Figure 19:Calculating the length of each of the sections 𝑀1𝑁, 𝑀2𝑁, 𝑀3𝑁։ taking the smallest, we get the shortest length of the paths connecting the points M և N.
Conclusion. Thus, in our work we tried to present not only textbook-type, but also more complex types of problem-based problems through a variety of problems, by proposing
the solutions in each case.
 In the problems of each separate type group, all possible cases were discussedThe shortest paths were presented in almost all cases through general formulas.
  The work is so interesting that it requires a multifaceted approach, depending on the different positions of the points.  which we do not encounter in simple textbook problems.
