In various fascinating mathematics textbooks, problems of determining the shortest paths through the surfaces of polynomials or different spatial bodies are often posed, sometimes referred to as the "Ant Spider" or the "Locust" Spider.
Why are these problems called insects?
For several main reasons.1. To make it more interesting and understandable.
2. It is more convenient to consider these insects as a material point.
3. Insects can move freely in different sessions of the polynomial.
This paper addresses not only the problems of determining the simplest classical shortest paths, but also the problems of a more general nature.
In our work we have tried to make possible interesting generalizations և to consider practical problems.
The first section discusses the simplest problems posed in various geometry textbooks և fascinating math textbooks.
  The following method is used to solve such problems. It is necessary to depict the different spans of spatial bodies և to find the shortest path connecting the given two points on the plane.
       In the second and third sections, more serious and general problems are considered, when it is necessary to consider different cases of outbursts; the shortest way is not always obtained by adjacent sessions.
The cases of all possible arrangements on the locust's spider's face-to-face sessions were observed; in each case the shortest paths were determined by observing the corresponding stretches.
The work is interesting, instructive for both schoolchildren and teachers և architects, it is necessary to make a comprehensive analysis, even in the cases that are being clarified, to consider the positions of different outlines.
I. In this section, we will look at the simplest, most introductory set of problems posed in textbooks և books of interest.
Problem 1.1 [1] Find the length of the shortest path per unit area of ​​a cube that connects the opposite vertices of a cube (Figure 1).
Figure ․1 Solution.
 Since the paths have the same length in each session, it is sufficient to show that the cube is stretched in pairs, in each case the shortest path is obtained in adjacent sessions (Fig. 2).
For example, the shortest path crossing the 𝐷𝐷1 side will be ․𝐴𝐶1 = √4 + 1 = √5.
Answer: ։5.
Figure Խ2 Problem 1.2 [1] The side of a regular quadrilateral pyramid 𝑏 is the right angles adjacent to the vertex 𝛼.
 Find the length of the shortest path on the surface of the pyramid, the beginning and end of which is the same vertex as the base, it intersects all the sessions of the pyramid.
  Discuss all possible cases depending on J.
Solution.
  To ensure the shortest path, depict the lateral surface span (Fig. 3).
From Fig. 3∆𝑆𝐴𝐴1 ∠𝐴𝑆𝐴1 = 4𝛼.
The following cases are possible: If 4𝛼 <1800, ie 𝛼 <450, then 𝐴𝐴1
If 𝛼 = 450, then 𝐴𝐴1 = 2𝑏.
If 𝛼> 450, then the shortest path of the surface is 2𝑏, because in a flat stretch հատված1 does not cross the lateral surface of the pyramid.
Answer: if 𝛼 <450, then the shortest path is 2𝑏𝑠𝑖𝑛2𝛼, if 𝛼 ≥ 450, then the shortest path is 2𝑏.
Problem 1.3 [1] The base radius of the cone is 2𝑎 and the parent radius is 6𝑎.
  Find the shortest path along the conical structure that passes through the parent endpoint at the base մյուս intersects the other alloys.
Solution.
  Draw the lateral surface of the cone (Fig. Եւ4) ենքcalculate the length of segment 𝐴𝐴1, which will be the shortest path: 𝑙𝐴𝐴1̌ = 2𝜋𝑟 = 4𝜋𝑎Fig ․41800 𝛼 𝛼 ⇒ 𝛼 = 1200 և ∆𝑃𝐴𝐴1 according to the cosine theorem 𝐴𝐴1 = 6√3𝑎.
Problem 1.4 [2] The radius of the base of the cylinder is,, the height is ℎ.
 Find the length of the path on the roller that connects 2 points on the circles of different bases.
Solution.
  Draw the lateral surface of the cylinder (Fig. 5) համար To find the shortest path, connect points A և B of the cylinder in a straight line.
If 𝑥 <𝜋𝑟, then the shortest path is Nk․5𝑙short = 𝐴𝐵 = √ℎ2 + 𝑥2.
If 𝑥 = 𝜋𝑟, then 𝐴𝐵 = 𝐴′𝐵 = 𝑙short = √ℎ2 + 𝜋2𝑟2.
If 𝑥> 𝜋𝑟, then the shortest path is 𝑙short = 𝐴′𝐵 = √ℎ2 + (2𝜋𝑟 - 𝑥) 2.
Problem 1.5 A spider is standing in the C corner of the ceiling of the room, and an ant is sleeping in the K corner of the floor.
 What path should the spider choose through the walls of the room to reach the ant by the shortest path (Fig. 6)?
Solution.
  That is, the spider և the ant are sitting on opposite vertices of the rectangle.
The shortest possible paths intersect the FG side, or the DF side, or the EG side, each of which will have the shortest paths: 1 ․ FG road (Fig. 7) Fig ․6 floorFig. 7𝐾𝐶2 = (𝑎 + 𝑏) 2 + 𝑐2, then 2 և By EG և DF roads (Fig. 8)
k 2 = (𝑎 + 𝑐) 2 + 𝑏2, then 2 = (𝑏 + 𝑐) 2 + 𝑎2, then Fig. The relations 8 (1), (2) և (3) differ only in the last summands.
 The products 2ab, 2ac, 2bc can accept different values ​​depending on the size of the room a, b, c, ie the shortest paths depend on the dimensions of the room. one.
  fractions.
Dividing 2ab, 2ac և 2bc by 2abc, we get: Consider the following 3 cases.1․If a> b և a> c, then the smallest case will be 𝐾𝐶2 (3).
, then the smallest of those 2 ․ If b> a և b> c, the shortest path will be 𝐾𝐶1.
3 ․ If c> a և c> b, then the shortest path will be։.
That is, the shortest path will cross the longest side.
II. Even more astonishing are the problems in which the shortest path is obtained not in the span of two adjacent sessions, but by bypassing three kits.
These problems are more general, ինչպես it is possible to make both affordable but at the same time interesting privatization, as well as various generalizations.
In this section, we will look at two main problem classes: from the private (input) problem to all possible generalizations.1 ․ When the points belong to the opposite sides of the cube, we generalize in the case of a rectangle.
2 ․ When one of the points belongs to one of the sessions of the cube, and the other to one side of the opposite session, we generalize in the case of a rectangle.

 The point M on the side D1C1 is marked so that D1M = a.
 Arbitrary 𝑎 ∈ [0; 1] In the case of a value, determine the length of the shortest path connecting the points K և M on the surface of the cube.
Solution.
  Determine the shortest paths connecting the points K և M on the surface: 1. With sessions AA1B1B և A1B1C1D1, Fig. 92: AA1B1B, AA1D1D և A1B1C1D1, 3.

Problem 2.3 The locust m is restored on one of the two opposite sides of the rectangle.
at point n, the spider on the other p.
at q with respect to the point.
  What is the shortest path a passer-by needs to reach the locust on the surface?
Solution.
 This problem is brought to the combination of problem 1.2 և problem 1.5, but the result is not very simple in the general case, as in this case it is necessary to take into account the dimensions of the rectangle a, b, c.
III. The next lesson of the most difficult problems is the study of the arbitrary positions of the locust in the opposite session in the case of a fixed arrangement on the side of the esard որոշ the determination of the shortest path.

Problem 3.2 Given a cube 𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐷𝐴1𝐵1𝐶1𝐷1 with K AB on the sides AB և BC և𝐴𝐵.
  Find the position of point M The points L are chosen so that 𝐵𝐾 = 𝐶𝐿 =
On the plane 𝐴1𝐵1𝐶1𝐷1, so that the shortest path from M to և K is equal to the shortest path from M to L (Fig. ․15).
Fig. 15 Solution.
 To find the shortest path connecting the points K և M, find A1B1, plotting the seats of the cubes ABA1B1A1B1C1D1 so that they lie in the same plane ¥ Fig.
Fig. 16A1B1 The shortest path crossing the rib will be MK.
  To find the shortest path intersecting the ribs BB1 և B1C1, we need to depict the stretch differently.
 The picture shows dotted lines և dots are marked with dashes.
 And finally, in order to find the shortest path intersecting the ribs AA1 1 A1D1, we need to depict a single stretch with dotted lines, and the vertices with double stripes.
  Therefore, the shortest path connecting the points M և K to the surface of the cube will be one of MK, K / M, K // M.
The perpendicular bisector of K / K passes through point B1 և intersects D1C1 at point E such that.
Thus, if point M is inside triangle EC1B1, then MK / will be the shortest distance.
  In the same way there is a point F with KK // - perpendicular image, which divides D1C1 by 1.
In 5 ratios.
 If the point M is inside triangle A1D1F, then MK // will be the shortest distance.
 In other cases, MK is the smallest.
Consider the points L, L /, L // և U, V in the same way by dividing it by A1D11.
2 և 1.
In 5 ratios.
Fig ․17 Thus A1B1C1D1 was divided into 8 parts, each of which is easily located the shortest path, connecting the point M on the surface of the cube with the points K և L.
 For HNOB1, the lengths of these paths are approximately equal to MK և ML.
 Therefore, if M is inside HNOB1 է belongs to the geometric location of the sought points, then it also և belongs to the midline of KL.
In the same way, the geometric location of the points sought in OC1B1 is the median of LK /.
 Now we can construct the geometric position of the points M so that the shortest path with the surface of the cube connecting the points M և K is equal to the shortest path with the surface of the cube connecting the points M և L (PQ is the median of KL /, QR is KL, RS is KL / of, ST of K // L /).
Problem 3.3 Given the points N on the seat M և 𝐴1𝐵1𝐶1𝐷1 on the side AB of the cube 𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐷𝐴1𝐵1𝐶1𝐷1 (Fig ․18).
  Find the shortest path connecting the points M և N on the surface of the cube.
Solution.
 To do this, you need to draw the cube on the plane with 3 eggs (Fig. 19).
It can be taken from point N to a plane parallel to 𝐴𝐴1𝐵𝐵1, which 𝐴1𝐵1, 𝐶1𝐵1,
The sections 𝐴𝐷, կհ will intersect at points 𝐷3, 𝐶3, 𝐷2, 𝐶2, respectively և solve the problem for 𝐴𝐴1𝐵𝐵1𝐷3𝐶3𝐷2𝐶2 (since the path will not pass through նիստ3𝐶3𝐷2𝐶2).
Figure ․18 Figure ․19 Calculating the length of each of the segments 𝑀1𝑀, 𝑀2𝑁, 𝑀3𝑁, taking the smallest, we get the shortest length of the paths connecting the points M և N.
Conclusion. Thus, in our work we tried to present not only textbook-type, but also more complex types of problems through more comprehensive և various problems, proposing the ways of solution in each case.
 In the problems of each separate type group, all possible cases were discussed, and the shortest paths were presented in almost all cases through general formulas.
  The work is so interesting that it requires a comprehensive approach, depending on the different positions of the points, which we do not encounter in simple textbook problems.
