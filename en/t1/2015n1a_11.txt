The United States is a world economic and political leader, and the analysis of the recent anti-crisis experience is quite valuable both in theory and in practice, with the aim of further improving the state of anti-crisis regulation of the economy.
The legal basis for the anti-crisis settlement of the US economy was the "American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan", which provided about $ 790 billion for economic recovery (we are talking only about the volume of assistance to the real sector of the economy).
  Under the mentioned program it is planned to implement a set of measures that have both direct and indirect effects on the economy.
In general, the main areas of crisis management in the US economy are: • Assistance to organizations in the acquisition of troubled assets, financial assistance, • stimulating domestic demand, • stimulating the labor market, • developing innovative potential, • supporting SMEs, creating financial incentives for them; infrastructure development.
Below are the main directions of the anti-crisis regulation of the economy, according to the allocations directed to the latter.

The next major direction of anti-crisis measures is the reduction of the tax burden for the population և organizations, which accounted for about 36% of these allocations.
19.6% of US $ 154.8 billion in anti-crisis spending went to US infrastructure development, including $ 48.7 billion (6.2%) for energy infrastructure development.
 It should be noted that the US government attached great importance to the development of the energy sector, ensuring the country's energy security, reducing the economy's dependence on energy imports, and discovering alternative energy sources, which was reflected in the country's anti-crisis program.
 It should be noted that the United States accounted for about 22.55% of world energy consumption, which was quite high compared to other countries.
 In the run-up to the global financial crisis, the United States has reduced its fuel and energy production in the country, instead expanding its imports.
It should be noted that within the framework of anti-crisis regulation, about 13.3% of anti-crisis measures were directed to the financing of infrastructure programs of the economy.
 These programs included a number of sectors, in particular, transport, energy, telecommunications, water supply, agricultural infrastructure, etc.
 Moreover, these infrastructure projects would be fully implemented only at the expense of US-made raw materials.
 This clearly speaks of this country's anti-crisis settlement strategy լինելու long-term economic growth.
The survey shows that the bulk of US government anti-crisis measures (about 80%) were related to fiscal policy, with tax incentives accounting for 36% of the total package, of which 30% was for the general population. and 6% to organizations.
 It should be noted that the tax incentive measures did not provide for the abolition of taxes or reduction of their rates, but indirect incentives, such as the provision of tax "vacations", changes in amortization methods, tax reimbursements, temporary redistribution of tax burden, etc.
  It should be noted that only one third of anti-crisis measures have a direct impact on this or that participant in business relations.
 These include the expansion of public procurement, direct lending to SMEs, financing of infrastructure, etc.
 Some measures were taken to overcome the stagnation of the real estate market, where the risks of borrowers' bankruptcy were still high.
 In conclusion, it should be noted that about 80% of US anti-crisis measures were related to general economic policy, more specifically, fiscal policy, aimed at regulating general economic processes, such as expanding demand, stimulating investment, expanding fixed capital accumulation, etc.
 Only 20% of anti-crisis measures were selective, ie they are intended for specific areas, such as soft loans for SMEs, provision of guarantees, etc.
Referring to the analysis of the effectiveness of the above-mentioned anti-crisis measures, it will be carried out based on the quantitative-qualitative criteria and nature of the latter.
  Thus, the analysis of US macroeconomic indicators shows that already in the fall of 2009 there were signs of economic stabilization in this country. In the third quarter of 2009, GDP growth was recorded at 0.4%, or by annual results, the GDP decline was 0.5% compared to the previous year.
 According to the results of 2010, the GDP growth was 3.1%, դր As of December 2010, the GDP growth was 29% as compared to the same period of the previous year, According to the results of the same year, growth was registered in all sectors of the real economy.
 Production of durable goods in 2010 exceeded the production of short-lived goods by 3.5%, and in 2011 - by 9.6%.
 According to the results of 2011, the GDP growth made 4.1%, դր as of November of that year, the production index exceeded the index of the same period of the previous year by about 19.2%, ներով According to the results of that year, the production growth made 5.2%.
Due to the growth of production, the financial situation of American enterprises also improved. According to the results of 2010, the profit of the American non-financial sector increased by 11.4% as compared to the previous year, and by 17.4% as compared to the 4th quarter of 2007.
Research has shown that 60% of US GDP growth in 2011 was driven by consumer spending, 23% by investment growth and և 11% by net export growth.
  Already in the third quarter of 2011, the US GDP index exceeded the crisis level, exceeding it by 0.2%.
The main increase in US government spending was recorded in 2009, amounting to about 36% of GDP.
 It should be noted that it was at the expense of large government expenditures that it was possible to avoid a sharp reduction in personal consumption expenditures, it was a strong impetus to increase investment due to the growth of savings.
  In 2011, government spending fell to 33% of GDP, which is typical of the US economy.
  At the end of the third quarter of 2009, the level of investment in GDP reached 25%, compared to 22% in the worst period of the recession.
The most serious post-crisis problem in the United States was the high level of unemployment, in the fight against which the state anti-crisis measures did not provide significant positive results.
As in 2011, the unemployment rate in the first half of 2012 was 9.0%, which was 0.63% lower than in 2010, but still higher than the natural level of the latter.
  This was explained by the fact that the rates of economic recovery were not yet sufficient to reach the potential level of GDP, to reduce unemployment to a natural level.
  The main obstacle to rising unemployment was the sharp decline in the construction sector as a result of the crisis, which resulted in large numbers of workers being laid off in both the sector and its infrastructure.
 In addition, it should be noted that the low rate of recovery of the US economy was due to insufficient foreign investment, which decreased due to the crisis.
Thus, the analysis of US macroeconomic indicators shows that the economic growth in this country after the crisis began in the second half of 2009, the main macroeconomic indicators characterizing the economy by the end of 2011 had reached pre-crisis levels.
  The production index in 2011 was already close to the pre-crisis level of 2007, and the GDP exceeded the pre-crisis level by 0.2%.
 It should be noted that with a macro-statistical index of 0.184 anti-crisis effectiveness, the United States ranked second in the world after Great Britain.
As for the main short-term measures contributing to the restoration of economic growth, they were the following: • Creation of new jobs. About 2.5 million jobs were created as of 2011, և this process is continuous, • implementation of infrastructure projects, • reduction of the tax burden on the income of the population խ promotion of consumer spending, • reduction of the tax burden on business.
In the medium to long term, anti-crisis measures that promote economic recovery can be distinguished: • Implementation of infrastructure projects; • Investments in human capital; • Financing of innovative projects. As already mentioned, the effectiveness of anti-crisis measures is determined by the nature of its main elements.
  Therefore, regarding the effectiveness of US anti-crisis measures, we can conclude that the priorities of the US state anti-crisis settlement have been: • Reducing the tax burden on business, • Promoting consumer spending, both directly and indirectly by reducing the tax burden on various programs. Encouragement - financing, both directly through the implementation of infrastructure projects, and directly through the implementation of science and human capital.
Taking into account the above-mentioned, the mentioned priorities of anti-crisis measures and the directions of their implementation can be considered strategic, as the latter aim to have a positive long-term impact on the economy, ensuring long-term economic growth, investment promotion, development of priority sectors
  At the same time, the directions of the state anti-crisis measures were coordinated with the strategic directions of the country's development, such as stimulating consumer demand, developing innovations, increasing the energy efficiency of the economy as a precondition for further sustainable economic growth, and at the same time eliminating the financial crisis. The main reasons contributed.
  All this testifies to the US government's commitment to the long-term economic growth of the US government.
As for the nature of anti-crisis measures, the bulk of the US anti-crisis measures, about 70%, were indirect in terms of their impact on economic actors.
  The latter pursued goals of stimulating the general economy more than directing effects on specific economic entities.
The following is an assessment of the effectiveness of the US government's anti-crisis measures.
Judging by the positive dynamics of macroeconomic indicators, we can conclude about the effectiveness of the US anti-crisis program.
  2009 From the second half of the year, growth was observed in all sectors of the economy, and in 2010 most of the macroeconomic indicators of the economy equaled the pre-crisis indicators (Tables 2,3).

Financing of infrastructure projects (13.3% of the anti-crisis package), including energy - 6.3%, financing of research projects - basic science - 5.5%, investments in human capital - 32%, financing of sectors most affected by the crisis, mainly production and construction spheres - 8%.
Anti-crisis measures to support the real sector of the economy (first of all, stimulating aggregate demand նվազ reducing the tax burden) were aimed at eliminating the main causes of the crisis in the economy, which were the reduction of domestic demand անկ the decline in lending.
Most of the tools selected for anti-crisis measures (69%) are classified as indirect methods of state regulation of the economy;
  This would stimulate the cleansing of the economy from inefficient participants ևimprove the conditions for doing business.
In order to reduce the risks associated with anti-crisis measures, state control was tightened by increasing the publicity and accountability of the allocated funds.
Strategy - Elimination of the causes of the crisis - Toolkit Description - Risk control - Reduction Referring to the main factors limiting the effectiveness of US anti - crisis measures, let us single out the main ones. • Increased state budget expenditures, • Increased unemployment as a result of declining potential GDP, • Inadequate foreign investment as a result of the global recession.
The main risks of the US state crisis management regulation were: • the risk of misuse of funds, the reduction of which strengthened state control, • the increase of state intervention in the economy, • the increase of the budget deficit.
In order to reduce the risks of state economic regulation, an unprecedented high level of control over the use of allocations was envisaged, which was enshrined in the US Anti-Crisis Program.
 The latter stipulated that the allocated funds would be distributed according to tenders, auctions, grants, the results of which should be published on the Internet.
 In addition, the US House of Auditors was given additional funding and authority to properly oversee financial investments in the economy.
In conclusion, it should be noted that the US anti-crisis measures can be considered effective, given the level of economic downturn caused by the financial and economic crisis, the rate of post-crisis economic recovery.
  It has been more effective than in other world countries, such as the EU, Russia, China and Japan.
  Moreover, the US recession started earlier, it was deeper compared to the mentioned countries.
