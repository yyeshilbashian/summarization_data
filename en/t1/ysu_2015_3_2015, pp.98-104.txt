FUNDAMENTALS OF SPELLING OF THE SOUND-LETTERS OF THE VOCABULARY (5-12th century BIBLIOGRAPHY) In the ancient Armenian phonetic system, the sounds of the beginning of the word have undergone a historical change, as a result the sound of the beginning of the word is pronounced.
 Grabar scholars often find it difficult to understand the basics of using sounds.
In this article, examining the basics of spelling letters, it became clear that being guided only by the provisions of historical-etymological spelling is not enough. A number of propositions of comparative linguistics should also be introduced, as most words beginning with the letter h // y are borrowings.
There are a number of observations on the historical development of Armenian letters and letters in Armenian linguistics.
 E. Aghayan considers the reason for the Grabarian change of the letters h / y to be Grabar. … If the word starts with a vowel, then during vocalization the vocal cords should start vibrating from the moment we start expelling the air, otherwise, if the vocal cords start vibrating later, the expelled air gives breath, ից the sound increases from the beginning of the word »1.
Մ. Abeghyan presents a separate sub-chapter in "Theory of the Armenian Language" entitled "The change of the Y sound into H hagag", noting that in the original literary language of words, in many dialects, the y sound either came out or was largely identified with H hagag. with.
  "There are dialects in which, at the beginning of a few words, the old y's, apparently, come to mind as a vowel, which is a new sound in our language."
Varag Arakelyan in his work "Grabar Grammar" calls the phonetic change of the beginning of the word y> the "expressive change" of the consonants3.
Ashot Abrahamyan referred to the pronunciation differences of the TV consonants in his work "Grabar Manual" in the subchapter "Changes in the pronunciation of consonants", presenting several examples4.
H. indicates the Indo-European origin of the sound h in modern linguistics. Martirosyan. The sound h at the beginning of a word can be either a phonetic addition or an ancient reflection of the Indo-European throat * H.
That sound of the beginning of the word has been preserved only in Armenian և Khetaluvian languages ​​1 See Aghayan E., Fundamentals of Linguistics, Yerevan, 1987, p. 267.

  For example, in the Old Armenian there is the word hav, which means grandfather, ancestor, who is descended from the Indo-European * HawHo pap, ancestor և is related to the Latin words avus (grandfather), Gothic awo (grandmother) to the Lithuanian av'ynas (uncle).
  The Armenian also has a chicken of the same name - bird, meaning chicken, one of the relatives of which is the Latin word avis (bird).
 Its Indo-European root is thought to have been in the form of * Hawis1.
With the expectation of an exhaustive answer to the question of the orthography of the phonetic letters of the beginning of the word, we have studied the roots beginning with the phonetic letters by performing an etymological, semantic, phonological-typological examination.
The weakening of the consonant y at the beginning of the word is observed from the 5th century, as in the second component of the word yoghdoghd the consonant y fell during repetition.
H. Acharyan explains the process of deleting the pre-consonant and turning it into breath on the other hand as follows: "Between the two" is the breathing y, which is still used in the dialects of Karin և Mush, և if the breathing sounds turned into breathing deaf, then the breathing y turned into h.
  In both cases there was a resurgence of vibration. ”2
The change of sounds of H // y sounds H. Acharyan considers them to be progressive, which are the result of "many imperceptible successive changes" 3.
 In order to know the spelling of the letters H / sound correctly, it is necessary to know the "sound laws" of the sound changes of the ancient Armenian language, the only proof of which is the repetition of the same expression without exception.
According to the etymology, the words beginning with the sound letters H are: 1. The sound-letter sequences used in Indo-European roots: • p> h - hal (melting), hagh (time), father, furnace (oven), care (pain), soul, hol // roll (naked), soil, wind ( cool), shepherd, fire // hrat (fire), thick (strong), firm (exact), har // floor (hit), smooth, bed (river), hinel (weave), herd (sheep group), horan, rich, bride, question (inquiry), hegh, far (far from place or time), heriun (machat), plow (1. running the land, 2. field), heru (last year), hև, hen (weaving) , five, old (sick), sick.

The first basis for distinguishing the sounds of the beginning of a word is the realization of the preposition y.
 By the fifth century, it was already ingrained in its roots.
Examining the orthography of the sounds of the beginning of the word, the phonetic features, performing a phonological-typological examination, we came to the following results: Ha-301, He-75, Hi-28, Ho-55, Hu-26, H-77, Hi-19 Ya Examination of the typological usage of the sounds -111, Ye-34, Yi-34, Yo-45, Yo-45, Yu-21, Y-6, Yu-1H // y, it became clear that the sound oh is more frequent than y.
 According to the frequency, the Armenian sounds precede the a, h, e, o, i, and vowels.
