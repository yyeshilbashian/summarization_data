THE PRECEDENT OF LOCKERBIE AS A PRECONDITION FOR THE FORMATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF AUT DEDERE AUT JUDICARE The rulings of the praetors և other magistrates (oral statements) իս decisions acting as a precedent in Roman law.
  Time was the "proof" of the justification of the introduction of judicial law, the guarantee of its stability.
  As a result, the concept of "settled jurisprudence" (jurisprudence constante) emerged.
 Judicial precedent when acting as a legal act of the court.
  In legal theory, the court precedent is defined as the decision of the court in a specific case, the substantiation of which is obligatory for the same instance when making decisions in similar cases.
 Thus, the court precedent is the decision made by the court in a specific case1.
In contrast to parliamentary legislation, judicial legislation is predetermined by the fact that: • Judicial legislation is always a by-product of justice. it is not an independent action in the sense that it is conditioned by the exercise of the main function of the judiciary - justice; • it is exercised on the basis of a law adopted by the legislature շրջանակներում within the law; • judicial legislation related to interpretation լր filling legal gaps is developed by judges only norms, based on legal principles, and not on the subjective expression of a judge.
  The above-mentioned legislation should not contradict, first of all, the constitutional provisions, they themselves cannot change or abolish the law2.
The principle of judicial precedent strengthened the binding nature of judicial decisions not only for the parties to the case, thereby renouncing the principle of resjudicata.
 The principle of stare decisis was formed, which means to keep the decisions and justifications of the previous cases.
 It is necessary to pay attention to the binding parts of the different precedents of the court decision 1 See Cross R., Harris J., Precedent in English Law, Oxford, 1991, p. 100.

to the question of
  Thus, it is possible that in particular which part of the court decision contains the element of precedent, the part of the motives (motifs) or the conclusion (dispositifs).
  The UN International Court of Justice has expressed its opinion on this issue, noting that not all parts of the court decision are endowed with precedent binding force.
  According to Judge Anzilotti of the UN International Court of Justice, only the concluding parts of the decision are binding, not the reasons 1.
It is necessary to state that the concept of precedent is not identical for domestic և international legal systems.
  The term unprecedented in international law has its interpretation, in particular, its interpretation is conditioned by the composition of the subjects of international law, their peculiarities, the peculiarities of international law as an independent legal system.
  States, as subjects of international law, have a great role in the formation of international practice and the creation of norms of international law.
According to Article 38 of the Statute of the United Nations International Court of Justice (hereinafter referred to as the Court), "the Court shall, in resolving matters referred to it, apply ... judicial decisions դ the doctrines of experts of different nationalities best known in the field of public law.
Thus, the Statute of the Court includes its decisions among the sources of international law.
1992 On March 3, 1971, Libya filed a lawsuit against the United States in the fight against illegal actions against civil aviation security. In connection with the dispute between the parties over the interpretation of the Montreal Convention և application 3.
21.12.1988 In Lockerbie, Scotland, Flight 103, owned by Pan American Airlines, was operated from London Heathrow Airport to John F. Kennedy Airport in New York.
  The plane crash was decided by the US District Court in 1991. Two Libyan citizens have been charged, according to which they placed an explosive on the plane, as a result of which the plane sank.
The claim against the Libyan Court is based on Article 14։ 1 of the Montreal Convention.
The Court first examined the United States's objection to the Court's jurisdiction և Libya's position on this issue, based on Article 14 1 1 of the Convention. "Any dispute between the Parties concerning the interpretation of the Convention shall be settled by negotiation and, if this is not possible, by arbitration.
  If, within six months of the request of one of the parties to the arbitration, the parties are unable to agree on the conduct of the arbitration, the party 1 See Bederman D., International Law Frameworks. Foundation Press, 2001, p. 45.

3 See Questions of application of the 1971 Montreal Convention arising from the aerial incident at Lockerbie April 14, 1992, ICJ Reports at 114.
Upon request, the case may be heard in the International Court of Justice in accordance with its statute. "
The parties acknowledge that their relations are covered by the provisions of the Montreal Convention, which were in force և´ during the plane bombing և´ by Libya.
  However, the United States considers that the instrumentation does not fall within the jurisdiction of the court, as not all the conditions of Article 14 1 1 of the Montreal Convention have been met.
 In particular, the US representative noted that Libya had not proved that there was a legal dispute between the parties, and that even if there was a dispute, Libya had not proved that it concerned the application and interpretation of the Convention, so Article 14 of the Convention could not apply. .
 Later, the American side mentioned that the circumstances of holding negotiations, requesting arbitration and maintaining the 6-month period related to it have not been proven.
  In this connection, the Court finds that the dispute between the parties could not be settled through negotiation, and the defendant's refusal to arbitrate relieves Libya of its obligation to comply with the six-month period laid down in the Convention.
Libya stated in its position that the only legal document applicable to this dispute is the Montreal Convention.
  The United States has said that the Montreal Convention does not apply to the case, as it does not refer to "bilateral disputes" but to "the threat to international peace and security that has arisen as a result of state support for terrorism."
In the Court's view, the dispute concerns the interpretation of the application of the Montreal Convention, and should therefore be guided by Article 14 1 1 of the Convention.
The Court finds that there is a dispute between the parties concerning the application of Article 7 of the Convention.
 According to Article 7 of the Convention, "the Contracting State in whose territory the alleged perpetrator is situated shall, if he does not extradite him (without exception, regardless of whether the crime was committed in his territory or not) be obliged to refer the case to the competent authorities of his State for prosecution." .
The Court notes that the requirements of Article 11 of the Convention apply to the dispute between the parties in this case. "The contracting parties are obliged to provide legal assistance to each other during criminal proceedings.
 In all cases, the law of the State to which the request for legal aid is addressed shall apply.
The rules of Part 1 of this Article shall not apply to bilateral or multilateral agreements between the Parties on the provision of legal aid in criminal matters. "
The United Kingdom և the United States demanded that Libya extradite those accused of the crime և to prosecute the relevant Libyan officials, to find all the materials related to the crime, to submit all the documents և material evidence, as well as to pay appropriate compensation to the relatives of the victims.
At the outset of his dissenting opinion, Judge Oda stated that the substance of the case, which is being heard by a jazz court, is that the two sides are at odds over the extradition of two Libyans who are in Libya and are accused of flying to Pan America on US Airlines flight N 103. in the area of ​​destruction 1.
In fact, the following happened in the relations between the United Kingdom and Libya. The United Kingdom has requested that the accused be extradited to Libya, but Libya has refused to comply.
 There is no dispute between Libya և the United Kingdom և over the interpretation of the Montreal Convention և regarding the request for extradition of the accused մեր the rejection of that request, which is the main issue in this case.
  That is why the statement made by Libya against the United Kingdom under Article 14 կետ 1 of the Montreal Convention must be rejected.
Նորë `Çëáí, a new principle was formed in international law: aut dedere autjudicare (to bring to justice ùñ »Ï³Ù to bring to justice Ñ³Ýó³Ýù ³ÝÓ ³ÝÓÇÝ) 2.
The legal significance of Security Council resolutions.
  The United States pays particular attention to the fact that the measures against which Libya objects are measures taken by the Security Council in accordance with Protocols 731 (1992), 748 (1992) and 883 (1993).
  Security Council Resolution 731 (1992) called on Libya to respond promptly and effectively to United Kingdom և US mediation, and Security Council Resolution 748 (1992) called for economic action in Libya3.
According to the US position, Libya, appealing to the Court, tried to annul the Security Council decisions.
 The United States has argued that even if Libya's claim is based on the provisions of the Montreal Convention, those claims have been replaced by other Security Council resolutions based on Chapter 7 of the Charter.
 It follows that the dispute between Libya and the United States is regulated by the norms based on the above-mentioned decisions.
Libya claims that the specific wording of Protocols 731/1992 /, 748/1992 / / 883/1993 / clearly shows that the Security Council has never demanded that Libya extradite its citizens to the United States or the United Kingdom.
  During the court hearings, Libya stated that this was always its main argument.
 In addition, Libya believes that the Court should interpret these protocols "in accordance with the Charter determining their legal force", and the Charter prohibits the Council from requiring Libya to extradite its citizens to the United States or the United Kingdom.
  Libya concludes that its statement is admissible "because the Court can decide without prejudice to the interpretation of the Montreal Convention ... regardless of the legal significance of Protocols 748 (1992) և 883 (1993)".

In addition, Libya draws the Court's attention to the principle that "the date of its submission is a decisive factor in determining the admissibility of a declaration".
The court finds that Libya's last consideration should be accepted.
 1992 March 3, when Libya submitted its application, is in fact the only date that is crucial in deciding the admissibility of that application.
  Therefore, it is not possible to be guided by the protocols of the Security Council 748 (1992) և 883 (1993), as they were adopted later.
  As regards SC 731 (1992), which was adopted before the date of application, it cannot be a legal impediment to the admissibility of the application, as it is of an advisory nature և has no legal binding force.
 This means that the Libyan applicant can be declared inadmissible on the above grounds.
The American side stated in its objection that even if the Montreal Convention recognizes the rights that Libya claims, this case is not applicable in accordance with the resolutions adopted by the UN Security Council (1992 N 748 և 1993 N 883).
 According to the respondent, the dispute arose in Libya և between the UN Security Council և, և the provisions of Article 14 1 1 of the Montreal Convention do not apply to it, therefore և the dispute can not be examined by the Court in any case1.
In his statement, Judge Herceg considers that Libya's demands are influenced by the mandatory decisions of the Security Council, which deprives Libya's application of its substantive basis.
In his special opinion, Judge Coymans finds that the Court's sole task is to determine the presence or absence of a dispute under consideration.
The fact that this issue has been referred to the SC for consideration և The Council has made a decision in this regard which does not in any way affect the Court's competence ման to determine the objective reality of the existence or absence of a dispute.
On the objection that Resolutions 748 (1992) և 883 (1993) deprived Libya's claim of a substantive substance, Judge Coymans shared the Court's view that the objection was not at all preliminary in nature.
  However, he also considers that these resolutions, no matter how authoritative, are not final and decisive, therefore the decision to accept the case can not be questioned.
Judge Rezek considers that the logic of the arguments put forward by the parties would have been more comprehensive in the Court's decision if the issue of the Court's jurisdiction with respect to the political bodies of the Organization had been reflected in that decision.
He considers that the Court has full jurisdiction to interpret or exercise the right in this or that case, even if the exercise of such jurisdiction may lead to a critical review of the decision of any other UN body.
 The Court does not represent any member state of the United Nations, but as soon as the Court is not subject to any political influence, it is a body of interpretation of the rule of law, which is the criterion for any democratic procedure2.

According to Judge Schwebel, the fact that Protocols 748 (1992) և 883 (1993) were adopted after Libya submitted its application is irrelevant.
 Despite the fact that the jurisdiction is usually established from the date of submission of the application, there may be some exceptions.
 The cases referred to by the Court have nothing to do with this case.
The question arises: does such a decision of the Court hinder the efforts of the Security Council in the fight against terrorism, does it provide a means for disobedient states to avoid the implementation of Council decisions by appealing to the Court, does the Court have jurisdiction over Security Council decisions?
Judge Schwebel considers that the Court does not, in general, have such powers և, in particular, that it has no right to repeal or reduce the significance of decisions of the Security Council confirming the existence of any threat to peace, և determining the measures to be taken to eliminate such a threat.
  The court has repeatedly stated in this connection that it has no authority to exercise judicial control.
 There is no hint in the Charter that the Court has such a right.
 It is the opposite of the Charter, because if the Court had the power to repeal the decisions of the Security Council, the Court would have exercised administrative powers in the areas where, according to the Charter, the Council has such powers and functions.
The provisions of the Charter ությունը the history of its creation testify to the fact that the Security Council is subject to the principle of the rule of law, but at the same time it has the right to depart from the norms of international law, if it is necessary to ensure international peace.
 The fact that the Council is obliged to adhere to that principle, and the Court is the main judicial body of the UN, does not mean that the Court will have jurisdiction to ensure that the decisions of the Council are in accordance with the law.
  The nature of the negotiations in San Francisco shows that the authors of the Charter did not intend to reserve the right of judicial control to the Court.
The Court cannot agree with this position because the above-mentioned resolutions were adopted by Libya after the submission of the application, and according to the practice of the Court, the adoption of Security Council resolutions does not limit the Court's jurisdiction over any legal dispute.
In the light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the arguments put forward by the respondent concerning the Court's lack of jurisdiction to hear the case are unfounded;
Thus, the legal significance of the decisions of the UN International Court of Justice is that the precedents of international law are clarified and concretized through precedent, later applied in the practice of international relations, and the precedent of "Lockerbie" is based on 1 See Bordunov V., International Air Law, Moscow, 2007, pp. 88-90.
