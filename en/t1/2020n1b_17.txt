Introduction.
 Solving systems of linear equations is one of the most common problems in a number of sciences related to mathematics.
  Since linear functions are the most well-studied models, the most common dependence models are linear models, which in turn lead to the solution of systems of linear equations.
  Therefore, the rapid solution of systems of linear equations becomes relevant when studying various problems in different branches of science.
  And their speed can be solved with the help of digital methods.
then straightforward methods for solving systems of functional linear equations.
Gaussian method (expulsion of variables).
 Consider a system of linear equations for an unknown. Let's look at one of the most widely used methods for solving systems of equations, the Gaussian method, also called the variable expulsion method [1-3].
  With the help of the Gaussian method, the calculations are performed in 2 main stages, which are called straight-reverse steps.
  The essence of the Gaussian step-by-step method lies in sequential deportation, which results in a system equivalent to the baseline system with a corresponding upper-angle matrix.
  The determination of variables is done in the reverse step.
The direct step consists of the expulsion steps.
In particular. Step 1.
 The purpose of this step is to exclude the variable from the equations.
 Let's call it the main element of the first step.
Find the quantities called 1-step manufacturers.
 (1) Equations 2, 3,…, -1 of the system of linear equations by subtracting the quantities from the corresponding equations multiplied mentally.
  With the exception of the Saturn linear equations system, we will expel the system from the equations, the variable.

Step.
 The goal of this step is the system of linear equations, where the variable is expelled from the equations.
 The coefficient is called the main element of the -th step.
  Find the step-producers.
The system-equation of the system of linear equations obtained during the previous step, subtracted from the equations by multiplying them by their quantities, and leaving the equations 1, 2,…,-unchanged.
  This will allow all the equations of the system, except for the 1st, 2nd,…, -equalities, continuing the expulsion - in the general case of the expulsion - we will get the following system with linear equations. variable.
Equation like this As we can see, the resulting system (3) already contains, because as a result of the changes, some equations can be thrown there, becoming identities.
 Moreover, it is assumed that no equation was obtained during the shifts, the coefficients of which are 0 on the left and 0 on the right, because in that case the resulting system, such as the equivalent (1) system of starting linear equations, would be incompatible.

The system of linear equations obtained in the penultimate step is performed as a result of performing the straightforward calculations of the straight step of the linear Gaussian method.

As we can see, as a result of the program written in PASCAL programming language, the answer coincides with the result solved by the direct method.
Note, however, that the written program does not allow systems of solvable linear equations whose number of unknowns coincides with the number of equations.
  Obtaining the algorithm of the mentioned case և the design of the program is connected with rather big difficulties և can be solved in case of serious work by the specialists of the relevant field, the programmers.
However, in recent years, computer mathematics kits have been developed by relevant specialists, which are a powerful tool for solving systems of linear equations for various mathematical problems [15-18].
  Such packages are MAPLE, MATHEMATICA, MATLAB, MACSYMA և other computer packages, which allow solving without delving into the nuances of programming.
  We will use the Mathematica package.
  The solution of mathematical problems of different nature leads to the solution of systems for determining the roots or equations of different types of equations [15-18].
  For this purpose, the package provides quite effective means, of which in this case we can mention Solve, Reduce, Eliminate mathematical problems - operators.
  Using the mentioned operators, let's solve the systems of linear equations solved by direct methods for the purpose of comparative analysis.

As we can see, in the case of all the examples used by both operators, the answer is obtained instantly with the Resolved Result.
Completely coincides with the comparative analysis of the results of solving systems of linear equations by the direct method.
  Let us present the comparative analysis of the solutions obtained as a result of the application of direct և numerical methods for solving the systems of linear equations (Table 1).
As a result of the analysis we can state that .1. The direct և digitally obtained results of the solution of systems of linear equations coincide with the methods.
using 2. The foremost advantage of digital methods for the analysis of systems of linear equations is the saving of time by applying straight methods.
  Of course, in order to solve linear equation systems in PASCAL programming language, it is necessary to write the program in advance, but having it, any system can be solved in 4-5 seconds, of course, when the number of unknowns is equal to the number of equations.
  And in the case of the MATHEMATICA computer package, it is possible to solve a system of arbitrary linear equations instantly by simply importing the appropriate operator.
3. The advantage of the MATHEMATICA computer package over the PASCAL programming language is that with the latter it is possible to solve a system of linear equations of any kind, and with the help of the PASCAL programming language it was possible to solve only systems of linear equations where the number of unknowns was equal to the number of equations.
