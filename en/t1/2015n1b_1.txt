G. plays an important role in the processes of modern Armenian literature. The multi-genre literature created by Khanjyan.
  He seems to create equally in the fields of prose and dramaturgy.
 However, it seems that the study and analysis of our reality in the writer's plays takes place in a more objective, visible and expressive artistic environment, and the actors are more impressive and convincing in their human description.
 The dramaturgy of a writer who has passed an effective creative way is most closely related to the patterns of modern dramaturgy and the manifestations of national life in terms of its content and variety of artistic tricks and conventions.
  A concept of existentialist ideas is noticeably felt in the author's worldviews and aesthetic approaches, which in a unique way reveals the playwright's point of view and attitude towards the national, internal political, moral-psychological phenomena.
  However, G. Khanjyan interprets the vital phenomena in the plays of his collection "Theater 301" [1], using the domains of the value system and universal aesthetic ideals rooted in the national culture.
In one of our articles [2] we showed G. Some peculiarities of Khanjyan dramaturgy, analyzing the plays "The Year of Satan" written on the historical theme "Theater 301" with a historical theme.
 This article examines the playwright's other plays depicting modern life in the "Theater 301" [1] collection.
 In these plays, the writer is actively interested in the internal political, moral and psychological shifts in our reality during the last decades, various political intrigues in the name of democracy, legal and illegal (especially illegal) efforts to succeed in the presidential elections.
  Within the framework of the genre's possibilities, the comedy "There is no escape from you" was created using some principles of Surrealist imagery.
  Radio host Tigran, the leader of a party called Galust, was offered to run for president by his party, promising all kinds of financial support.
 Tigran, however, had to act according to his dictation after being elected.
 Regardless of Galust, the representative of the criminal world Scho, in his turn, tries to support Tigran on the condition that he undertakes to fulfill the decisions in the interests of the criminal world.
 These unusual offers to Tigran and his wife, Tamar, become attractive, as "Galust" and "Shkho" give them a considerable amount of money to participate in the election campaign.
 Such an incredible, somewhat seemingly probable history exposes the legal principles of democratic politics to the abusers who serve the interests of their party members or the criminal world.
It is noteworthy in the comedy that Tigran reveals his ideas about the events taking place in a unique way, presents "ingenuity", gives a unique interpretation to the opportunity given to him to participate in the election campaign.
 His cynicism towards political issues, for example, was expressed in his discretion when interpreting the meaning of the concept of "democracy", which, according to him, means simply "to lead the people."
 Of course, the information received from those with connections with the upper echelons of power also contributes to the political adventure.
 For example, Shkhon Tigraninas, representing the criminal world, is in "It is the ministers or the prime minister who, you think, will stick with us" [1, p. 254].
Through dialogues, the playwright quite accurately reveals the distortions caused by the collapse of modern political life, especially the expectations of unworthy candidates related to the presidential elections, their sponsors, their bodyguards to occupy high positions.
 The latest play is presented in the play by Galust's bodyguards Sakoyu Karo.
 In addition, in case of being elected president, Tigran (trying to seduce) is visited by representatives of homosexuals and prostitutes to strengthen their place in public life with the support of the future president of the republic.
A remarkable transformation is taking place between Tigran and Tamar.
 The money earned promotes not only ideas about the prospect of a prosperous life but also arrogance and greed for power.
 The prospect of having the power and rights of the President of the Republic is more in Tigran.
  Such a premonition awakens in him, first of all, feelings of exaggerated self-glorification, exaggerated notions of his abilities and possibilities.
 Here are the judgments he makes regarding the proposal addressed to him. "Do not think anymore.
 I have been given a chance, not by these people, no, but by the Upper Providence, He has established, kings are chosen by the gods.
 I knew from childhood that I would be chosen, I modestly waited for my hour, I knew that my time would come.
So, no whining, no regrets ”[1, p. 270].
 Thus, the former radio host, based on the above-mentioned proposals, which promise other dubious success, consciously considers him to be fully worthy of being a presidential candidate.
  Entering the game, he finds himself in funny tragic situations.
It gets to the point that he, selfishly trying to save himself from the fire that broke out in his apartment with one gas mask, wants to use that catastrophe for his campaign.
  "TIGRAN - The fire on the eve of the elections can play a good role. As they say, there is no evil without good.
In the evening newspapers, radio and television will publish that the house of presidential candidate Tigran Hayki Haykazyan was set on fire by unknown people on the eve of the elections, firefighters somehow saved the life of the subordinate և his relatives, the causes of the fire are being investigated, terrorism is not ruled out "[1, p. 284].
 And Tigran's victorious, victorious, victorious cries on the occasion of the fire, the desecration of misfortune, unintentionally push the public to see his և E. Among the interiors of the famous Panjuni image of Otyan.
 Intimacy makes both equally disgusting.
 In the field of comedy, Tigran is first the soul of Brave Nazar, then of Panjuni.
Within the framework of the artistic reality of comedy, the idea of ​​the existence of a high moral and psychological value in a modern Armenian man was expressed in the image of Tigran's father.
 It turns out that the latter fought during the Artsakh liberation war, was wounded, is now confined to a mobile chair for the disabled, is dumb.
 His father hears, understands, but cannot speak.
 He expresses his attitude to the events taking place at home through the language of movements.
 The playwright informs the reader about it through remarks.
 The father realized that the boy had accepted the rules of the game to run in the presidential election illegally, and had even been blackmailed by Galust, who financed the campaign, and in the absence of the latter, threatened to take revenge on him.
 The author presents the attitude condemning his son through a remark as follows: "Dad is trying to explain what you are doing, where are you, boy" [1, p. 263].
 There is an obvious authorial intention in the episode when the following narrative thought is heard in the reading of the radio host Tigran Haykazyan, which is again presented in a remark. "The reading of the Book begins with the line" BAN E, chapter C, "I built my building like a fool on the sand" [1, p. 264].
  Tigran is indifferent to such a warning, saying it is an old recording.
After all, an authoritarian attitude towards a presidential candidate like Tigran is expressed through a contemptuous speech uttered by Tamar over the phone, which can be considered an attitude towards an's popular authority, an unknown candidate.
"This is an assassination attempt," says Tamar. "Terror, my husband is a presidential candidate."
  What, do you care? ”[1, p. 284].
  In the comedy, each active person is presented with different unique aesthetic-literary tricks of satire. Humor, irony, satire, and ridicule are used here again.
  The murderous mockery in the play is combined with acts of cruelty, such as Tigran, accusing Galust of murdering a journalist, blackmailing, Tigran's house being set on fire, and so on.
 At least the dramatic tension is intertwined with the comedy.
  The artistic intertwining of all this was done with great skill, due to which "Escape from You" should be considered one of the best plays of the playwright; in the other plays of G. Khanjyan's "Theater 301" collection the life of middle and lower class people is mostly depicted.
 To raise sharp social and psychological questions, the playwright even uses the novel "Trial" by the world-famous Austrian writer F. Kafka, creating the drama "Case N FC-2".
  Using the names of biblical characters for his characters (Joseph, Mary, Paul, Peter, Martha, Mary, Matthew, Simon, etc.), as well as introducing the anonymous characters in their profession or positions (Lawyer, Inspector, Investigator, Counselor, Director, Priest, etc.) The author, in fact, by making a generalization, turns the judicial system in the state into an arena of sharp exposures and criticism, where a person is not accused in a civilized way; in general, the world order where human dignity is not respected is condemned.
  The depiction of condemnation of an innocent person, bribery, and various kinds of lawlessness in the judiciary was a unique response to make the similar phenomena of our reality visible and to condemn them.
G. Khanjyan is endowed with the peculiarity of penetrating our public life, sculpting the painter of an individual's destiny, depicting him in a certain development.
  He tends to depict the unique individual and national mentality of his heroes in border situations.
  Where man is tempted to find himself in the midst of the realities of the present moment, in the ideas and feelings of eternal moral values ​​that vibrate within him, where there is a desire to establish order in inhuman, absurd relations, as a deep distrust of the achievements of science.
 From the point of view of these ideas, let's examine the two-act play "Gordian Knot".
  Here is a unique limited environment - a building with metal mesh windows, then "Underground or a big hole, niches on the walls", where the relationships and relationships of the characters take place.
 By artistic convention, it represents a small world, which symbolizes the phenomena of the big world and human characters.
  And the actors of the play perform without special names, with their professional, sexual, physical characteristics / Boy, Girl, Professor, Mistress, Sanitary A, Sanitary B, Drunk, Woman, Priest, Miachkan, Poet, Idiot, Voice.
 Introducing them in such a way shows that they are generally deprived of a complete human personality, or they have been deprived of the opportunity to be so.
 Everyone serves the director of that institution, who appears in the play only with his voice.
 What? Among them, however, there was sympathy for the Boy and the Girl, who refused to obey those who enslaved them, such as the director of the hospital and the Professor.
 They do not betray the Boy Girl, who is hiding from the pursuit of the latter.
The way of life, life and behavior of these people gathered in the underground person have a number of parallels with the environment in which the playwright lived and in general.
 This circumstance increases the cognitive significance of the work.
 The play ultimately condemns the devaluation of man, in particular the fact that human organs are traded against their will, and consequently enslave man (regardless of gender) in modern reality.
 The inevitable situation (which has in common with the social, economic, moral and psychological hardship created for those of us living in our reality) turns into a Gordian knot.
 The writer, not seeing the way out of the current situation, not seeing in the sphere of rational regulation (the representative of science, the Professor, in fact, became the deputy director of the hospital, the accomplice and perpetrator of criminal acts), can not consider such conditions humiliating and restricting his freedom.
  The real egg of rebellion against the absurdity of irrational reality becomes the natural outburst that takes place in the dumb idiot, the latter explodes the hospital and the underworld, killing himself as a result of the explosion.
The playwright G. Khanjyan, using theatrical, stage, dramaturgical conventions, in fact, in every way creates heroes who embody his ideas about the human environment known to him in the environment.
With them, he creates a mosaic image of the post-Soviet years, our society, the present crowd, different human and national groups, groups, individuals, which becomes a typical artistic environment for the expression of his creative, aesthetic and worldview ideas in general.
  Such a picture is presented by the play "The Expressway in the Dark".
 There is no plot here, it is the conventional environment train, which symbolizes the modern era.
 The play presents different characters, people in different moods, who are personified without names.
 The author once again shows the imperfection of the imperfection of the representatives of our society, some masses.
 According to the author, such a mass of people could not be found in the great movement and process of national and public life.
  They get off the train in the last episode of the play's conditionality, as they are parasites of time.
In the playwright's modern life and the aesthetic evaluations of plays depicting people, irony prevails over the manifestations of satire.
 It occupies a middle position between humor և satire ևև used, combined as needed.
  The image of Captain Abgar is obviously ironically created in the comedy "The Ship of the Sun".
 With his understandings of pathetic patriotism, patriotism, leader, leader, he is a satirical image of a public figure with unrealistic ideas.
 The captain of the real-symbolic ship, finally finding himself in a border situation, is abandoned by all the crew members of his ship: Captain Gokor, mechanic Jakan, cook and nurse Shushan, who was in love with the captain.
  The latter act with the pragmatic thinking typical of modern man, accountably.
 They do not share the captain's uplifting spirit with national and world values, as they see that his ship and plan of action have nothing to do with the real environment and real opportunities.
According to the German existentialist philosopher K. Jaspers, "Human existence has two sides:" existence in the world "- real existence / existence / - freedom, the essence of man, which is manifested only in borderline situations (illness, death, etc.)" .
 Some manifestations of such a worldview are noticeable. In Khanjyan's dramas.
  In our opinion, such a bio-philosophy is very effective for artistic thinking in general.
 We see various remarkable expressions of such approaches in the playwright's works "Bolero", "Cemetery Choir", "Roadside Theater", "Arrest", "Guardians of the Ruins", "Homeless Dogs", "Pahmtots".
 In the play "Guardians of the Ruins" the image of post-Soviet years or the early period of independence is presented by the beggars who appeared at the bottom of social life with the image of Sirak, Luco, Matsik, Orpheus, the prostitute Woman, their perceptions.
  Begging is really their borderline situation, because in the past they were people involved in society, with a certain profession, a family.
  They have found themselves in such an extreme situation for various reasons.
 The collapse of the Soviet Union, the earthquake, the material insecurity in the conditions of new market relations, etc. contributed to it.
  The border situation is aggravated by security threats, as a result of which they are conducting military exercises inappropriate for their age.
 What is remarkable about the play is that, out of conditional freedom, begging, they still prefer to be involved to some extent in public life, so they even voluntarily come to perform the unusual, unpleasant and forced exercises of the Guard.
  Their human, humanitarian character traits are manifested spontaneously towards those who come in contact with each other, even towards the Guard who tortures them with exercises.
 And when, thanks to Orpheus, it turns out that the Guard allegedly took part in the Karabakh liberation war, they became more angry with him.
  And so, the Guardian's condition worsens when the shard left in the body during the battles moves.
 The beggars try their best to help him.
 Unable to pay for the hospital, when the Guard does not want to seek medical help, Luso says. "Do not be afraid, my dear boy, are we dead? We will work day and night, collect money, give it to the hospital, do not be afraid" [1, p. 230].
 The image of the Guardian was also impressive.
 His strange, rude behavior towards adult beggars is repulsive in advance and provokes a benevolent attitude.
 Gradually, when the cause of it is found out to some extent, the attitude of the "beggars", the reader or the audience towards him changes.
  The Yerkrapah who took part in the Karabakh war had a guard post entrusted to him, where in some circumstances he was wounded by a bomb blast and even got some mental disorder.
 In his consciousness, however, the idea of ​​protecting the guard post in every way was fixed.
 In fact, for the sake of the homeland, he is a human character dedicated to fulfilling the duty entrusted to him, one of our brave young men who defended the homeland at the cost of his life in the guard post entrusted to him.
The play "Roadside Theater" successfully presents the image of Grigor, a businessman who died or died during a car accident, in a imaginary environment, where other heroes appear in a theatrical performance.
 In this environment is the girl whom Grig-Grigor loved.
 He promised to get married, had sex with a girl, and then left.
 The director, in the person of Grigor, who is a civil servant-businessman, constantly exposes the essence of the activities of his class, the falsity and selfishness.
In one of the first episodes, for example, opening the context of Grigor's words, he says: "We become bureaucrats to start a business under our own protection" [1, p. 166].
 And Grigory is already directly accused of selfishness and irresponsibility, of breaking the oath by the Girl who was deceived and abandoned by him in the past, who, as it turns out, committed suicide.
 In the play he says: "No, egoist, you can not remember, I do not want you to remember, you are a user. User, use, throw, use, throw, what to remember, what is it for you people? zero, especially the woman, right? ”[1, p. 169].
 Considering the whole system of conditionality of the play, it can be said that to some extent the incompleteness of the characters, the publicist expressions are poorly conditioned by the illusory, worldly, dreamy, unreal environment.
 Here again the absurd and the mythical were merged, combined with the whole.
The structure of the drama "Detention" is mainly depicted in traditional biographies.
 Here the characters are more vital, the visible manifestations of details about their life, character, psychological structure, moral ideas contribute to that.
 The author, in general, guided by ordinary aesthetics, created episodic characters of Mardo, Nazo, Tina's grandmother, Kuku, the doctor, seeing in the lives of these ordinary people և the boredom of the manifestations of everyday life, monotony, և the spontaneous creative work of the working man in Mardo's inner self. dedication to doing work.
  Making plants in the herbarium of Armenia on his own initiative, destroying it due to the harmonious relations with the woman in everyday life, testifies to the fact that his love for beauty is suppressed by his boring daily life.
 The revelations of the beauty of the working human soul, the feeling of inner freedom due to the influence of the harsh realities of the constantly oppressed everyday life.
In principle, almost the same moral and psychological pressure is exerted on Taurus, who came to their house unexpectedly and escaped from a psychiatric hospital.
  When answering the doctor's questions, it turns out that his freedom is constrained by the monotonous, monotonous daily life, lack of caring interests, the demand for romantic dreams.
  He sees a lack of encouragement for such feelings not only in the Mardoyan family, but also in the behavior of the treating physician and the treatment of patients.
 In fact, Taurus in the borderline situation created for him more fully expresses the ability to appreciate the feeling of human freedom and beauty, the willingness to be direct with people, unselfish and unencumbered.
 His behavior in Mardoyents' house testifies to all that.
 Here he advises Tina to play by indulging in self-indulgence, encouraging Mardo to look at samples from the herbarium collection.
Such a conclusion can be made from our literary analysis.
 G. Khanjyan's dramaturgy with its original literary tricks and characters, using the principles of realism, absurdity, myth-use, creates the artistic context of modern life, enriches the field of modern Armenian theater.
