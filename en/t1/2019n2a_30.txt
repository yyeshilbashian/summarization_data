(337 people) և 2016-2018 Ijjan CEC cooperated with 1307 employers carrying out economic activities in the region.
117 of them (8.9%) are state-owned, and 1190 (91.1%) are non-governmental organizations.
64% of the companies cooperating with the Center are individual enterprises, 15% are limited liability companies, 7% are non-governmental organizations, 3% are CJSCs, 3% are non-governmental organizations, 2% are cooperatives. , 2% are non-governmental organizations, 2% are subsidiaries, 1% are foundations և 1% are OJSCs.
  114 vacancies were submitted by cooperating organizations in 2018, which in 2014. is 47 more.
  2018 The number of employers applying for labor demand has increased by 41 or 193%.
Out of the unemployed registered in IjaniZTK, 312 people were employed in 2018, which in 2014. compared to 117 people.
  Employment rate among the unemployed registered in IjaniZTK in 2018 was 19.5%.
Although the number of vacancies collected from employers is growing year by year, the labor market tension coefficient is still high.
ConclusionEmployment rate of labor in Ijjan region Table 6. In the market in 2014-2018. [6] Registered unemployed Vacancies in the labor market Tension coefficient in the labor market The labor coefficient (the ratio of vacancies announced by employers to the number of unemployed job-seeking citizens) in the Ijani region in 2018 was 7.1 points, which is 2.8 more than in 2014. և 1.4 points in 2017 compared to.
In the absence of job stress, the increase is mainly due to the fact that vacancies in rural areas are limited, in part due to long-term vacancies, low wages, not very attractive jobs, job vacancies, vacancies, vacancies.
2019 Vacancies for waiters, cleaners, dishwashers, sewer workers, street cleaners, bakers.
Most of the vacancies are jobs submitted to the regional employment center by employers engaged in economic activities in the city of Ijan.
The growth of the market is conditioned by the fact that the registered unemployed from rural areas (they will make up 67% of the registered in 2018) refuse to get a job in the city of Ijan due to poor transport links.
In order to solve the problem of employment of the population of Ijani region, I propose to expand the list of paid public works included in the program (irrigation, repair of drinking water lines, new construction, repair of sewerage network, construction of new ones).
 Within the framework of such programs it is necessary to increase the level of professional employment.
  At present, after such work and taxes, the net salary is 3700 AMD.
That is why it is necessary to increase the daily wage from 5000 drams to 7000 drams in order to increase the attractiveness of work.
  In case of normal implementation of the program, it will also be possible to reduce the unemployment rate in the region.
 I also suggest the procedure for participating in facilitation programs. The regional employment centers are engaged in that.
