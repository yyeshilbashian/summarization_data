Historically, judicial precedent originated in ancient Rome, where judicial jurisdiction was recognized as the norm if it was confirmed by several court decisions. Roman law was preceded by the decisions of the praetors և other masters (oral statements) և decisions.
  Time was the proof of the justification of the introduction of the judicial norm, the guarantee of its stability.
  As a result, the concept of "settled jurisprudence" (jurisprudence constante) emerged.
  The court precedent is an act of law-making of the court.
  In legal theory, court precedent is defined as a decision made by a court in a specific case, the substantiation of which is mandatory for the same instance when making decisions in similar cases.
  Thus, the court precedent is the decision made by the court in a specific case1.
 In contrast to parliamentary legislation, judicial legislation is predetermined by the fact that: • Judicial legislation is always a by-product of justice. it is not an independent action in the sense that it is conditioned by the exercise of the main function of the judiciary, justice; are developed only on the basis of the existing norms և legal principles, but not on the basis of a subjective will of the judge.
  The above-mentioned legislation should not contradict the current, first of all, constitutional provisions, they themselves cannot change or abolish the law2.
 The principle of judicial precedent strengthened the binding nature of judicial decisions not only for the parties to the case, thereby renouncing the principle of res judicata.
  The principle of stare decisis was formed, which means to keep the decisions and justifications of the previous cases.
  It is also necessary to pay attention to the issue of the obligation of different parts of the court precedent decision.
  Thus, it is possible that which part of the court decision contains the element of precedent, the part of the reasoning (motifs) or the conclusion (dispositifs).
  The UN International Court of Justice has expressed its opinion on this issue, noting that not all parts of the court decision are endowed with precedent binding force.
 In the opinion of Judge Anzilotti of the UN International Court of Justice, only the concluding parts of the decision are binding, and not the reasons 3.
 It is necessary to state that the concept of precedent is not identical for domestic և international legal systems.
  The term precedent in international law has its interpretation.
  In particular, the peculiar interpretation is conditioned by the composition of the subjects of international law, their peculiarities, the peculiarities of international law as an independent legal system.
  States, as subjects of international law, have a great role in shaping international practice and creating norms of international law.
 According to Article 38 of the Statute of the UN International Court of Justice, "the Court shall, in resolving matters referred to it, apply ... judicial decisions և the doctrines of experts of different nationalities best known in the field of public law as a secondary means of determining legal norms" 4.
 Thus, the Statute of the UN International Court of Justice also includes the decisions of the International Court of Justice among the sources of international law.
 1992 On March 3, 1971, Libya filed a lawsuit against the United States in the UN International Court of Justice (hereinafter referred to as the Court of Justice) on March 23, 1971. In connection with a dispute between the parties over the interpretation or application of the Montreal Convention5.
 21.12.1988 In Lockerbie, Scotland, Flight 103, owned by Pan America, operated from London Heathrow Airport to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport.
  The U.S. District Court ruled in 1991 over a plane crash. Two Libyan citizens have been charged, according to which they placed an explosive on the plane, as a result of which the plane sank.
 The claim against the Libyan Court is based on Article 14։ 1 of the Montreal Convention.
 The Court first considered the United States's objection to the Court's jurisdiction և Libya's position on this issue, based on Article 14 1 1 of the Convention, on any dispute arising out of the parties' interpretation of the Convention և It should be resolved through negotiations, and in case of its impossibility, through arbitration.
  If, within six months after the request of one of the parties to the arbitration, the parties are unable to reach an agreement on the formation of the arbitral tribunal, the case may be heard in the International Court of Justice at its request in accordance with its Statute.
 The parties acknowledge that their relations are covered by the provisions of the Montreal Convention, which were in force և´ during the plane bombing և´ by Libya.
  However, the United States considers that the examination of the case does not fall within the jurisdiction of the court, as not all the conditions of Article 14 1 1 of the Montreal Convention have been met.
  In particular, the US representative noted that Libya has not proved that there is a legal dispute between the parties, moreover, even if there is a dispute, Libya has not proved that it concerns the application and interpretation of the Convention, so it can not act under the Convention. Article 14.
  Later, the American side also mentioned that the circumstances of conducting negotiations, requesting arbitration, and maintaining the 6-month period related to it have not been proven.
 In this regard, the Court finds that the dispute between the parties could not be settled through negotiations, and the refusal of the respondent to arbitrate relieves Libya of its obligation to comply with the six-month period laid down in the Convention.
 Libya stated in its position that the only legal document applicable to this dispute is the Montreal Convention.
  The United States has said that the Montreal Convention does not apply to the case, as it does not refer to "bilateral disputes" but to "the threat to international peace and security posed by the state's support for terrorism."
 In the Court's view, the dispute concerns the application and interpretation of the Montreal Convention, and should therefore be guided by Article 14 1 1 of the Convention.
 The Court finds that there is a dispute between the Parties over the interpretation of Article 7 of the Convention.
  According to Article 7 of the Convention, "The Contracting State in whose territory the alleged perpetrator is situated shall, if he does not extradite him (without exception, whether or not the offense is committed in his territory), bring the matter before the competent authorities of his State for prosecution." for".
 The Court notes that the requirements of Article 11 of the Convention apply to the dispute between the Parties in this case.
  According to Article 11 of the Convention, “The Contracting Parties are obliged to provide legal assistance to each other in criminal proceedings.
  In all cases, the law of the State to which the request for legal aid is addressed shall apply.
 The rules of Part 1 of this Article shall not apply to bilateral or multilateral agreements between the Parties on the provision of legal aid in criminal matters. "
 The United Kingdom և the United States demanded that Libya extradite those accused of the crime և prosecute the relevant Libyan officials, find all the materials related to the crime, present all the documents և material evidence, as well as pay appropriate compensation to the relatives of the victims.
  At the outset of his dissenting opinion, Judge Oda stated that the substance of the case before the International Court of Justice was that the two sides were at odds over the extradition of two Libyans now in Libya, charged with Pan America flight No. 103. in the destruction of an airliner in the United Kingdom 6.
 In fact, the following happened in the relations between the United Kingdom and Libya: the United Kingdom mediated the extradition of the accused in the territory of Libya, and Libya refused to comply with that request.
  There is no dispute between Libya and the United Kingdom over the interpretation of the Montreal Convention regarding the request for extradition of the accused and the rejection of that request, which is the main issue in this case.
  That is why the statement made by Libya against the United Kingdom on the basis of Article 14 1 1 of the Montreal Convention must be rejected.
 ՆորëåÇëáí, a new principle was formed in international law: aut dedere aut judicare (to bring to justice Ï³Ù »³Ï³Ý to bring to justice Ñ³Ýó³Ýù ³ÝÓ ³ÝÓÇÝ) 7.
 The legal significance of Security Council resolutions.
 The United States pays special attention to the fact that the measures against which Libya objects are measures in accordance with the Security Council Protocols 731/1992 /, 748/1992 / և 883/1993 /.
  Security Council Resolution 731/1992 called on Libya to respond immediately and effectively to the United Kingdom և US mediation, and Security Council Resolution 748/1992 called for economic action in Libya8.
 According to the US position, Libya, appealing to the Court, tried to annul the decisions of the Security Council.
  The United States has argued that even if Libya has the right to make a claim based on the provisions of the Montreal Convention, those claims have been replaced by relevant Security Council resolutions based on Chapter 7 of the Charter.
  It follows that the dispute between Libya and the United States is regulated by the norms based on the above-mentioned decisions.
 Libya claims that the specific wording of Protocols 731/1992 /, 748/1992 / և 883/1993 / clearly shows that the Security Council has never requested that Libya extradite its citizens to the United States or the United Kingdom.
  During the court hearings, Libya stated that this point has always been its main argument.
  In addition, Libya believes that the Court should interpret these protocols "in accordance with the Charter determining their legal force", and the Charter prohibits the Council from requiring Libya to extradite its citizens to the United States or the United Kingdom.
  Libya concludes that its statement is admissible "because the Court can decide without prejudice to the interpretation of the Montreal Convention ... regardless of the legal significance of Protocols 748/1992 / և 883/1993 /".
  In addition, Libya draws the Court's attention to the principle that "the decisive date for a declaration shall be the date on which it is submitted".
 The court finds that Libya's last consideration should be accepted.
  1992 March 3, when Libya submitted its application, is in fact the only date that is crucial in deciding the admissibility of that application.
  That is why Security Council Resolutions 748/1992 / և 883/1993 / should not be followed, as they were adopted later.
  With regard to Security Council Resolution 731/1992 /, which was adopted before the date of application, it could not be a legal impediment to the admissibility of the application, as it was of an advisory nature և has no legally binding force.
  This means that Libya's application cannot be declared inadmissible on the mentioned grounds.
 The American side stated in its objection that even if the Montreal Convention recognizes the rights that Libya claims, it is not applicable in this case, according to the resolutions adopted by the UN Security Council (1992 N 748 և 1993 N 883).
  According to the respondent, the only dispute is the dispute between Libya and the UN Security Council, which is not covered by the provisions of Article 14 1 1 of the Montreal Convention.
  Therefore, the dispute cannot be examined by the Court in any case.
 9 In his statement, Judge Herzeg finds that Libya's demands are bound by the binding decisions of the Security Council, which deprive Libya of its application.
 In his special opinion, Judge Coymans finds that the only task of the Court is to determine the presence or absence of a dispute under consideration.
  The fact that this issue has been referred to the Security Council for consideration, The Council has made a decision in this regard which does not in any way affect the Court իրավ's competence to find out the objective reality of the existence or absence of a dispute.
 With regard to the objection that Resolutions 748/1992 / և 883/1993 / deprived Libya's claim of its substantive substance, Judge Coymans shares the Court's view that the objection is not at all preliminary in nature.
  However, he also considers that these resolutions, no matter how authoritative, are not final and decisive, therefore, the decision to accept the case can not be questioned.
 Judge Rezek considered that the logic of the arguments put forward by the parties would have been reflected in the Court's decision more comprehensively if that decision ùÝÝ³ñÏí »նդ The question of the Court's jurisdiction over the political bodies of the Organization ÇñÁ.
 He considers that the Court։ has full jurisdiction to interpret մեկնաբան in this or that case, even if the exercise of such jurisdiction might lead to a critical review of the decision of any other body of the United Nations.
  The Court does not represent any member state of the United Nations, but just because the Court is not subject to any political influence, it is a court of law that interprets the rule of law, which is the standard in any democratic process10.
 According to Judge Schwebel, the fact that Security Council Resolutions 748/1992 / և 883/1993 / were adopted after Libya submitted its application is irrelevant.
  Although eligibility is usually established from the date of application, there may be some exceptions.
  The cases referred to by the Court have nothing to do with this case.
 The question arises as to whether such a decision of the Court hinders the efforts of the Security Council in the fight against terrorism, provides a means for disobedient states to avoid the implementation of Council decisions, or impedes their implementation by appealing to the Court.
  In this connection, the question arises whether the Court has jurisdiction over the decisions of the Security Council 11.
 Judge Schwebel considers that the Court's general authority does not have such powers; in particular, it does not have the power to repeal or reduce the significance of Security Council decisions confirming the existence of any threat to peace; it determines the measures to be taken to eliminate such a threat.
  The court has repeatedly stated in connection with this issue that it has no jurisdiction to exercise judicial control.
 There is no hint in the Charter that the Court Ý has such a right.
  On the contrary, it lags behind the Charter, for if the Court were to have jurisdiction to overturn the decisions of the Security Council, the Court would exercise its administrative powers in areas where the Charter has such powers as the Charter.
 The provisions of the Charter ությունը the history of its creation show that the Security Council is subject to the principle of the rule of law, but at the same time it has the power to depart from the norms of international law, if it is necessary to ensure international peace.
  The fact that the Council is obliged to adhere to that principle, and the Court is the main judicial body of the United Nations, does not mean that the Court has jurisdiction to ensure that the decisions of the Council are in conformity with the law.
                                 The nature of the negotiations in San Francisco shows that the authors of the Charter did not intend to reserve the right of judicial control to the Court.
 The Court can not agree with this position, because the mentioned resolutions were adopted by Libya after the submission of the application, and according to the practice of the Court, the adoption of the Security Council resolutions does not limit the Court's jurisdiction over any legal dispute.
 In view of the above, the Court finds that the arguments put forward by the Respondent concerning the Court's lack of jurisdiction to hear the case are unfounded և The Court has jurisdiction to hear a dispute between the parties concerning the application of the Montreal Convention։.
 Thus, the legal significance of the decisions of the UN International Court of Justice is that the precedents of international law are clarified, the norms of international law are clarified, later applied in the practice of international relations, and the Lockerbie precedent was the basis for extradition or criminal prosecution. to hold the Aut Dedere Aut Judicare accountable.
