Rumors are an integral part of the informal communication structure of society.
  Rumors areInsufficiently verified data of unknown origin in the process of interpersonal communication.
There are two possible studies of the psychology of rumorsbecause.
  The first is the rumors of mass moodsThey are a powerful form of self-expression of public opinion, secondlyThey are one of the most effective means of influencing mass behavior.
Rumors are usually unreliable information or anythingDistorted form of information transmission, spread exclusivelyword of mouth, as if it were a secret, word of mouth.
If we think about what rumors can be about, we will find that everything.
  Thematically, they occupy the whole potential world of human society. they are the most mature.
 Of course, the rumorsThey have their own hierarchy, their "circle", their index of sensitivity.
Note that rumors are always distorted, not completely true orThey are completely unreliable, at least unverified information.
 Ordinary rumor is, first of all, a "shadow" world, a unique "market" of information.
    The "value" of a rumor is that it owes nothingofficial, transferred to "own" means "foreigners"is about.
  In other words, this is good news for all strangersabout (or seemingly strangers).
 Thus, rumors play a unique rolehave in the matter of realizing the "stratification" of the society. the world
easily և steadily divided into "own" և "strangers" [4].
Ջ. Terner proposed the theory of social identification.
 There:it is said. a) we divide people into groups (categories);
This is convenient, tagging people is the shortest wayto know more about them; b) we confirm oursidentity, we associate ourselves with a certain group, calling it our owngroup, c) we compare ourselves to others, we are our groupWe oppose a foreign group, people outside our group.
  The feeling that "we are together" strengthens our Self-composition.
 This is a favorable feeling.
 We respect and: are proud of ourselvesWe are in our group [22].
According to mass consciousness, strangers are those whoThey are high either socially (government, leadership) orculture ("stars", aliens), then the world of rumorsare images of a hierarchy reflected in an "equalizing" consciousnesson the screen.
  However, it is possible to bypass the hierarchy.
 By spreading rumors, a person gets subconscious lightness from the fact thathow the listener reacts to the program with surprise, fear,with pride, with satisfaction.
  To enhance the impression, the information is often "creatively" enriched with unpleasant details.
 This mechanism is especially strong in its own socio-psychologicalPeople who are not satisfied with their status and have not found a worthy place in lifein the circle.
 Here I consider it necessary to refer to the notion of "our place".
The division of relatives and strangers has an archetypal mentalityfoundations.
  Finding our place can be understood literally as "place."in space, or in other words, our "place in life" as anyStriving for "significance".
  O. Genisaretski notes that
archaic space is meaningful. the top and the bottom are sacred,
Heaven is not just something above, it is the house of God,The inside is not just something below, but the world of the dead.
These appointments have penetrated deep into our modern consciousness.
  Concepts such as "concentration"(thought), "experience", "attribution", "influence", "close", "insight", "environment", etc., are clearly spatialized, in themselvesThey bear traces of archaic significance of space.
  In this sense"Own place" or "someone else's place" are deeply symbolic, they canunderstood as archetypes.
 [1]Generalized judgments to spread rumorsor the news, going beyond the "own", must be authorized by other groups to obtain "symbolic" measurements.
 For thatIt is necessary for the rumors to acquire stylization and necessary generality during the elaboration of the intergroup choice.
  It is possible that this is a category և science procedures, legalIt is not the universality of norms or other results of world rationalization.
 According to the internal structure, this is a "racial", "natural" universality.
  In social terms, this corresponds to the generalthe level of social life where they end updifferences.
There are such non-partisan-collectivist dimensions as the people, the nation, "all as one."
The issue of the speed of rumors is interesting.
  The speed of rumors is quite high.
 Consequently, they usually have a "priority" effect in delivering information to the audience.
 The "speed" of the rumor is facilitated by the effect of the communicative closeness of strangers.
  Ս. Milgram
In one experiment, a citizen was asked to share some information with a random acquaintance through a chain of acquaintances.
  It turned out that thousandsTwo strangers living miles apart to be able to just say "hello, I'm talking about Bill…"is an average of five people.
 [17]Unusual events and heroes are considered to be important points of rumors.
 The originality of the hero colors the opulence of the event և is determined by his obvious or hidden status և by special abilities.
 The essential is the hiddenthe opposite, the game of rumors on that ambiguity.
Hence the rumors used to make them workprivacy making them aware.
  Hero և eventsThe knot of attachment is "problematic", "painful point", publicarea of ​​maximum tension or breakage of the structure.
 It can beeconomic collapse, the succession of political power և newElite formation, international contradictions, etc.
It may be between the worlds of "strangers" and "their own"mediator. it is the anointed one.
  This is the storyteller who oftenrepeats his personality in one image - with a witness.
 This can:to be a relative, acquaintance or "a boy".
  This generalized image of A.Schutz called him a "well-informed citizen."
[20] The term "citizen" is not accidental here.
 The events told by the rumors take place in a "other" demonstrative environment.
 That stranger,The untouchable, repulsive, dangerous and attractive world is dreamed through the eyes of the suburbs.
  Remember the kitchen and the benches for women,backgammon table and pigeon huts for men և basementsand attics for children.
In any case, it is possible to contrast the closed world with the open world.The identification of the narrator և's listener can be directed to this or thatload!
 And the more "closed" the environment, the more life is fueled by rumors, including slander, gossip, trials, accusations, betrayals, and other such phenomena.
First of all, rumors with moral qualities are enoughThey are generalized, not localized, which opposes gossip or their means of expression, betrayal and misinformation.
  Second, rumors maintain a knot with time միջավայր their environment of origin, thus contrasting parables.և superstition.
  Third, the rumors are accompanied by fresh news, moreover, often even in the future - this contradicts the legends, anecdotes.
 Fourth, rumors are unofficial in advance,often anti-official, thus contradicting purely information.
  At the same time, the rumors are related to all the mentioned social communes by their origin, conditions of operation, internal structure, means of application and transmission.
Some communication technologies are used in marketing.
    The majority of the population today does not understand at allAdvertising as a reliable source of information.
  In that contextViral marketing is becoming one of the newest tools in the market, but it is still considered difficult to manage.
  People traditionally rely more on the advice of relatives's relatives, in whose environment they are more often transferred.various rumors.
 That is why they are a powerful tool for positive information about the company, production, brandfor distribution.
 For example, once an advertising agency in the St. Petersburg metros provided an opportunity to modelHundreds of girls, walking in pairs, cheering and cheeringDiscuss the new catalog of "Fleur de Sante" cosmetic brand.
 This realityHe envied the women around him.
  Catalog at the end of the promotionSales have reached high rates, and consultantsThey stood in line.
 At the same time, communication is the least manageable tool in all communication functions.
 It is possible to influence only "feeding" through the "release" of information և ways.
  What kind?The information can be subject to comments, it is difficult to predict.
 Rumors have serious flaws, due to whichThis means of communication is seldom used.
  The "spread" process is practically impossible to manage. It is an element that is spread by its laws, which still need serious research.
Rumors are an additional means of communication with a negative sign.
Any information that goes through rumors is mostly obtainedNegative coloring, regardless of the initial goals.
 Mass consciousness tends to react negatively, to blockthe positive.
  Negative consequences of rumor use are known,which force companies to make large enough investments to dispel "s" rumors.
  For example, Coca-ColaThe deciduous tooth is dissolved overnight, arsenic compounds were found in "Jermuk" ումն Transformation of information in factis inevitable.
The main theories of rumors.
  Let us briefly present the main theories of rumors.Allport, Postman (ALLPORT, GW, & POSTMAN, L. 1947).
  Theory:is based on two principles.Աս Rumors are spread when people make efforts on things ևto find meaning in the news.
• When faced with ambiguity and uncertainty about potential issues,The people try to find some meaning by retelling the interconnected rumors.
This meant that the power of rumors: rumorsUncertainty is the variable that predicts whether a rumor will spread or not.
  Rumors spreadbecome polished, shorter և short, sharpened, cut detaildetails, և perceived, more understandable և interesting listenersfor.
  Abrasion, sharpness և perceptibility occuroccurs because of the cognitive component of the people. This is what happens when people process information.
  Rosnow (Rosnow RL 1991) changed և slightly to Allport ուղղPostman's ideas.
  Rosnow argues that rumors are passed on because people need to explain vague, dubiousIn addition, talking about the news helps to cleanse and recover from the accompanying anxiety.
  To spread rumorsmentions four factors.• Rumors should be for potential listeners.
• They should increase personal anxiety.
• Must contain generalized uncertainty.
• Must be somewhat truthful [19].
Shibutani (Shibutani T. 1966) gave more importance to rumors, describing them as a collective experience.
 Rumors are observedare a recurring form of communication through which peopleunite in an uncertain situation, striving to create that situationmeaningful commentary.
  This can be viewed as:Collective solution of problems [21].
Classification of rumors.
   According to information typology:The rumors are absolutely inaccurate, with truth-like elementswith inaccurate, truth-like, inaccurate elements.
  By:origin, rumors can be spontaneous, natural, intentionalinvented and purposefully disseminated.
  They are possible!intermediate varieties.
R. Nepp suggested classifying rumors according to motivation
predominant type of tension [15].
  As a spread of rumorsmain motives: he singled out hatred, fear ևthe desire.
  We meet the same with G. At Allport - aggressive rumors, alarm rumors - talk-dreams.
 "Conversation-desire" contains a strong emotional desire,reflects the current needs and expectations of the audience(for example, USSR public debt shares must be reimbursed in drams).
  "Conversation-desire" performs a dual function.
 On the one hand, it meets the wishes of the people ևthus supporting their social survival.
 These kinds of rumors calm down, hinder negative emotions, the development of anxiety and excessive aggression.
 On the other hand, such rumors, by creating excessive expectations, demoralize the population.
  When:Over time, it becomes clear that the wishes will not come true, the opposite can happen: panic reactions, outbursts of aggressive behavior, hatred of those who "promise".
  For example, in the syndrome of "barbed wire disease" in apathyThere were many rumors circulating every day among the captivesIt turns out that it will end soon.
 Naturally, the wrong news about the end of the war led to deeper and sometimes final disappointment.
 One of the captives was so convinced of the day of liberation that he lost consciousness that same dayHe died the next day.
  For him, the war really endedthe day [10].
"Terrible rumors" carry և bring forward expressedNegative, terrifying moods ուզ emotional states,reflect a somewhat up-to-date but undesirable audienceexpectations.
  Usually these types of rumors come from social mediain the stages of tension(natural disasters, war, armedcoup).
 Their plots range from just pessimisticto the point of clear panic.
  These rumors are specialThey are spreading difficult social and political reformsin situations of power or socio-political systemin conditions of change.
 In such situations a limited set of plots appears, և those plots appearat the heart of terrible rumors.
  Some of them are transformeddepending on cultural, religious or national traditions.
The most common of the "terrible rumors" are food'sinevitable rise in prices, their elimination և imminent famineabout.
  Such rumors were recorded in Russia in 1917, in Chile1971-1973, in Afghanistan in the 1980s, in Armenia in 1991-1992.In the issues related to the "bread problem", a few years ago at the end of the year, there was a shortage of eggs in our country.
  Accepting the rumors "persecutedinstead of oil ”, some part of the population goes even unnecessarilyfood or acquires an incredible amount of it, whichAs a result, the market situation is actually distorted(conjuncture).
  The food quickly disappears from the counters, orIf inflation is on the rise, there may often be real famine.
In this way, they spread "the forthcoming counterattack of the opposition".Rumors of an impending military coup, revenge of those collaborating with the new authorities.
  The "main problem" of such rumors is understandable, on the one hand, the population is terrified,on the other hand, an experience of active resistance of new social forces,Intensification of chaos and disagreements, social calmdecay.
"Aggressive rumors" or "divisive rumors".
  These are not the only negatives that reflect the unwanted expectations of the audiencemoods և states, but also և directed at aggressive emotionsև incitement to behavioral response, rude aggressive actions.
These kinds of rumors arise in situations of sharp contradictions, which are connected with social, inter-group, inter-ethnic-international conflicts.
  At the heart of "Aggressive Rumors" plotsThere is an aggressive charge.
 The main function of aggressive rumors is not just to intimidate, but to deliberately provoke aggressive actions.
These rumors are made not narratively, which is significantdesire-rumors or scary rumors, but have a cling,"Telegraphic" look.
  Report short, episodic phrasesThere are certain facts that "call for revenge."
  These bearThey have a very strong emotional-negative charge, making "we" affectivein general, as opposed to "their" society.
  Such rumors demand retaliatory aggression.
 They spread in Baku ևAgainst Armenians in Sumgait.
From the effects of influencing people's consciousness and behaviordepending on the rumors can: a) disturb public opinion, but
not to go beyond clearly expressed antisocial behavior, b) to cause anti-social behavior in any part of the population, c) to destroysocial relations between people և lead to mass disorders.
In order to gain practical use in the process of studying rumors, we consider it possible to study certain types of rumors.
  Different rumors have different sources of origin, they are spread by people with different psychological characteristics, and the patterns of change of such rumors are different.are.
  Consider the political rumor research program.
  Essential characteristics of the listener for the tendency to gossip, in addition to the main personal characteristics - anxiety, extroversion, it is necessary to study political conservatism (assuming,that liberals are more likely to believe in rumors), political insight, group identificationlevel of consciousness.
  A detailed analysis of the social environment in which the rumors circulate is also possible.
 Here you can:The level of group cohesion, intragroup և intergroupthe level of conflicts, the nature of the influence of the media, the means of political struggle in society.
