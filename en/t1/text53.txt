In recent years, many specialists have been focusing on different types of operator algebra structures combined with non-reversible power systems.
  The well-known notion of group cross-product, which works perfectly in the inverse case, fails to directly convey the context of semi-group systems.
  In order to overcome the difficulties, 384 MATHEMATICS approaches the problem from different angles, develops new methods, separates suitable lessons for the groups, each with its own level of generalization.
 These include measurable or topological endomorphisms (see, for example, [5, 4, 8, 18]) or polymorphisms, ie dynamic systems of multivariate representations (see, for example, [1, 4). , 8, 19]), irreversible representations (e.g. [5, 10, 13]), interactions (see, e.g. [11, 12]), isometric operators (isometries, e.g. [6, 7, 9, 16, 17], and finally, a large number of works are devoted to specially structured subgroups (see detailed work with numerous recent citations [15]).
 New perspectives open up the inclusion of a graded system and, accordingly, the inclusion of graded algebra ideas (see [14, 2, 3]).
 The paper discusses a general system where no algebraic structure is required from the subset of the group under consideration.
  Of course, being a subset of a group is a limitation in itself.
  The structure and properties of the operator algebra (so-called C * algebra) corresponding to such a set (or rather, a special group accompanying it) are discussed.
  Some examples are also presented.
 1. Definitions and elementary properties. Suppose C is an Abelian group.
  For an arbitrary γ א Γ, consider l 2 (Γ) The operator of the right displacement of the Hilbert space: ࣯ γ.
  l 2 (Γ)? l 2 (Γ), determined from ordinary base {e α; on the elements α א Γ գործող with the action ࣯ γ e α = e γ + α.
  Suppose է is a subset of group C.
 Let J denote the contribution of the Hilbert space in space l 2 (Γ) by J.
  l 2 (झ)? l 2 (Γ), and for arbitrary γ define T γ from Γ.
  l 2 (झ)? l 2 (झ) operator as T γ = J * ࣯ γ J.
  This operator operates on the basis of: T γ e α = e γ + α, if γ + α א झ, and T γ e α = 0, if γ + α ב झ.
 385 MATHEMATICS Let us list some properties of these types of operators, first recalling the idea of ​​regulation in the class of partial isometric operators. V ط W if, and only if VV * W = V.
 Claim 1. For arbitrary α, β from Γ, the following relations occur: a) Operator T α is a partial isometric operator b) The set of operator T α coincides with - α with the operator corresponding to the opposite element: T α * = T - α c) T α T β ط T α + β , T α + β * T α T β ط T α + β * T α + β, T α T β T α + β * ط T α + β T α + β * d) operator T α ≠ 0 it and only if α + झ? ) ≠ ׎ e) if α + β झ झ, then T α T β T β * = T α + β T β *, and T α * T α T β = T α * T α + β.
 Proof. The first three properties are checked immediately.
 Consider the following.
  If T α = 0, then for arbitrary β from,, we have: where α + झ? झ = ׎.
  The opposite is obvious.
 As for the last property, let's bring only the output of the first relation. Now about the basic concept of work - group C,, which corresponds to the arbitrary subset of group C։.
 Claim 2. ՝: Γ is a subset of the Abelian group, and Γ է is the set of elements of the group for which γ + झ? झ ≠ ׎.
 That Γ झ set is a comparable group, ie γ א Γ S it and only if - γ א Γ झ.
 Proof. Note from the beginning that the C չէ group is not empty, since, obviously, 0 א Γ झ.
  Let, now, γ א Γ झ.
  Then, there exists s א झ, such that γ + s = t झ झ.
  So, - γ + t = s, which means - γ א Γ झ.
 386 MATHEMATICS Suppose C r * (झ) is an evenly closed algebra l 2 (2) in the class of finite linear operators of the Hilbert space, which is born with operators T α for all αs from Γ झ.
 Claim 3. Algebra C r * (झ) is non-denotable and contains the identical operator of the space l (։).
 Proof. It is obvious that the operator J * J is the identical operator of that algebra.
  If e α and e β are the base elements, and γ = β - α, then the derivatives of the algebra C r * (झ) differ from the base elements of l 2 (झ) Hilbert space, which means that The algebra is not brought.
 2. Structure. The following type of element: W = T α1 T α2 · · · T αn is called a unit, and the index of such a W unit (index), ind W, is defined as Claim 4. Suppose ՝ Γ is a subset of the Abelian group. .
  Then. a) Mon (झ) set of monomials is an inverse semigroup b) arbitrary W א Mon (झ) ind index of W belongs to the group Γ գ c) if W 1, W 2 א Mon (झ) and such , that W 1 W 2 ≠ 0, then ind Proof. The assertion follows from the fact that the WW * operator is a projector. WW * e β = e β, if W * e β ≠ 0, and WW * e β = 0, if W * e β = 0.
 Recall (see, for example [2, 14]) that the algebra C * is called H with respect to the given group H, if it is the closure of the union of the Banakh spaces numbered by H, the intersection of which by the group is a neutral element, and there is a conditional expectation from algebra C on the central (that is, corresponding to the neutral element of the group ha 387 MATHEMATICS) Banakhian subspace (which, by the way, is a C * algebra).
 The following result means that the algebra C r * (झ) is like this.
 Claim 5. Suppose C is an intermittent Abelian group, J is a subset of it, and C համապատասխան is a corresponding group.
 Let ࣛ γ be a closed linear polynomial born of the unit γ א Γ վի given the algebra C r * (झ).
  Then. a) The intersection of sub-areas born with different elements of group C է is the neutral element; ࣛ α? ࣛ β = {0}, α ≠ β א Γ झ b) arithmetic C r * (झ) is the closure of the union of Banakhyan ࣛ γ areas, C r * (झ) = closure {ْ γ א Γ झ ࣛ γ} c) there is a conditional expectation from the algebra C r * (झ) on the algebra ࣛ 0.
 3. Examples We present some examples that make the observed ideas more transparent and show the dependence of the properties on the choice of the group subset. a. झ = {1; 2; 3} ؿ Ժ, where ՝ is an additive group of integers.
 The corresponding group Ժ ունի has the form झ झ = {- 2, 1, 0, 1, 2,, and the algebra C r * (झ) is isomorphic to ࣧ 3 (ԧ), the complete algebra of complex matrices.
  Describe the corresponding analysis (scaling) of the combined algebra. ࣧ 3 (ԧ) = ْ ࣝ ࣽ, ࣽ א झ झ.
 Here ࣝ 0 is a diagonal C * subunit. ࣝ 1 looks like this: ࣝ 2, respectively, is as follows. 388 MATHEMATICS Finally, ࣝ is a set of ասական matrices for negative ࣝ. Let झ = {5; 8; 9 Ժ ؿ Ժ.
  Then Ժ झ = {-4, - 3, - 1, 0, 1, 3, 4}, and the algebra C r * (झ) is isomorphic again to the complete algebra of ࣧ 3 (ԧ) of the matrices.
 Describe the combined algebra gradation. ࣧ 3 (ԧ) = ْ ࣞ ࣽ, ࣽ א झ झ.
 Here again ࣞ 0 is a diagonal sub-algebra, ࣞ 1 looks like տես 3, respectively, the following. and ࣞ 4 looks like the previous example, the arbitrary ࣻ ࣻ space is a complex matrix for negative ՝: ࣞ - ࣻ = ࣞ ࣻ *, ࣻ = 1, 3, 4.
 These examples show that, depending on the choice of the set, the same algebra is graded in different ways.
