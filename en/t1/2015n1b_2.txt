The Genocide, its direct or indirect artistic echoes are always present not only in the modern Armenian literature, which bring their special local material and artistic peculiarities of meaning, but also gain a noticeable weight in world literature, directly related to human problems, becoming a special expression. They find many philosophical questions, in particular the crisis of humanity, its consumption already at the beginning of the 20th century.
  If the crime does not find its just retribution, it becomes continuous and continuing, that is why that past suddenly emerges in our present, we suddenly find ourselves in the same Gordian knot of problems as at the beginning of the century, "the whole underwater part of the iceberg" is used again. , that at first was ignored or forgotten.
In general, every war in art leaves its stable orbit of violent death, low-quality evil and cruelty (especially to the most helpless part of the people - the elderly, women and children), and with inexhaustible manifestations of humanity, which is why the reflections of the Armenian tragedy are endless and artistically unambiguous. .
  During the first Russian revolution, still in 1906, Hovh. Tumanyan writes Phil. Vardazaryan. "Indeed, such a ugly, so greedy, so unjust, monstrous fight, whatever Turkish-Armenian, has hardly happened.
 Maybe in prehistoric times, when people ate each other "/ 1,15 /.
 Changing and departing times raise new moral issues, the reader's awareness grows, the literary market today is enriched by the works of various writers, which are eloquent proof that the great tragedies experienced by the Armenians are far from ending or localizing.
 In our work we have presented some samples of foreign literature, mainly recently published, which referred to the Great Genocide with the aim of comprehensive revelation of the truth and deepening of humanitarian questions.
 In the focus of all these works is the fate of an entire nation and individual who suddenly became homeless, the untimely permissiveness of international diplomacy that will sooner or later be exposed to humanity, as the Spanish writer Gonzalo Guarch testifies in his book "White Mountain".
 Most of these novels are based on facts, documents (Guarch, Aylisli, Vonnegut, Yalcin, etc.), very often, as in Guarch, it reminds of a literary montage on an artistic-documentary basis, and sometimes rising from a naked fact. becomes the generalization of the whole historical period, due to the modern way of life և historically wise distance, but still not managing to acquire a weighty artistic value նույն The same honest thoughts and emotions are born in the great writers of the world, inevitably making them blood relatives of the great human family.
 We would like to single out the merit of the great Russian writer Sergey Gorodetsky, who was the first to our pain, weighed the ominous scale of European "humanitarian" diplomacy at different stages of the Armenian question.
 He was the first Hovh. Together with Tumanyan, he noticed the universality of the Armenian problem, about which the expert Demirchyan would write later.
 In the poem "My Armenian Brothers" Gorodetsky wrote: "There is so much to love you" / 2, 41 /.
  In the spring of 1916 in Tbilissi (Georgia), the correspondent of "Russian Word" Gorodetsky, preparing to leave for Van under the local governorate, at first simply believed that "it is a war for the life and honor of the Russian people" (2,270).
 A fruitful meeting with Hovh. From now on, with Tumanyan, it becomes the turning point of his whole life.
When saying goodbye to his young friend, he urges you to take care of the children, he adds. "Do not forget the Kurdish children.
 They are as unreal as ours ”/ 2, 281 /.
  The reaction of what is seen and heard becomes not only in the 10s of the Russian writer. poems and articles, etc. He is planning to write a three-part epic "Archelian Viper" (later "Shamiram Gardens"), from which only the novel "Bright Red Storm" was published in 1928.
  The writer referred to the novel "Shamiram Gardens" during his lifetime, and the last complete version of the work was published in 1970. It was discovered and published by Irma Safrazbekyan first in the magazine "Literary Armenia", then only recently, in 2010, in the book "The Last Scream".
 This amazingly modern work is distinguished not only by the poetic perceptions of life, in spite of everything he has to speak about, with extreme emotional saturation, monologue, but also by rich subtextual interpretation, leading to the need to protect universal values, the idea of ​​brotherhood.
 Yeghishe Charents and Sergey Gorodetsky have been separated for only 13 years, but the perceptions and assessments of what happened allow us to find remarkable parallels between Charents' "Dantean myth" and "Shamiram Gardens". Both artists loved that land, which was already "inhabited" by the dead, yet "full of fairy tales and undisturbed beauties."
 The feeling of irreversible losses will not be delayed. In the article "Destroyed Paradise" (1916) published after his first return, Gorodetsky will write: "The memory of the sufferings that man causes to man is terrible.
 And not in war.
 Suffering is not terrible in war.
 It is unbearable when you think that hundreds of thousands of peaceful, defenseless people have been brutally tortured by unspeakable people, with subtle blows of body and soul. The feeling of being at the scene of massacre and destruction can be compared to nothing but the power of grief and pain. .
 Irreparable evil, indelible disgrace, helpless anger for the insult inflicted on the human soul. These are the first feelings that Turkey evokes "/ 2.52 /.
 On July 18, with the next retreat of the Russian troops, the Van ostracism ends.
 It would not be wrong to say that Gorodetsky was the first writer to rebel against the unjust behavior of the great powers, namely Russian diplomacy. to the British երը The pages written in a separate drama, which tell about the two-sided policy of tsarism. The Russian command had distributed weapons to the enemy Kurds to exterminate its allied Armenians.
 The philanthropic writer delves into the psychological problems that follow the genocide. "Fatigue and sorrow had driven all their strength and omnipotence out of them.
 They (the survivors) were lost among the living dead.
 They did not know anything now, they could not, they did not want to "/ 2,458 /.
  After the inhuman sufferings, the Armenians found themselves "in the whirlwind of immortality", uprooted, "out of being".
In the second half of the twentieth century, a new branch of genocide was formed in a number of countries around the world, one of the immediate consequences of which was the growing interest in foreign literature in the Armenian Genocide.
  On the other hand, for the time being, the great powers need to "remember" the Armenian Question in order to solve their own problems, as it happened in June 1987, in order to block Turkey's entry into the Council of Europe.
 The last two decades have been translated into Armenian by the American Kurt Kurt Vonnegut, the Spaniards Maria Anglada, Gonzalo Guarch, Jose Guriaran, the German Jew Erich Hilzenrat, the Turkish Kemal Yalçըn, Orhan Pamuk, the Azeri Akram Aylisar's dream. գործ The works of others.
    In those works, as a rule, what happened to the Armenians is seen as one of the expressions of the unruly course of a person, who is constantly "enriched" by new facts of his demoralization and retreat.
  Hence the universal value of such works, which are well realized by world writers.
 The existence of an individual, a social group, is endangered, as real life is moving away from humanitarian ideals, violence, cruelty are openly encouraged, and the catastrophe of becoming a zombie is threatened, which is manifested in the emptiness of his eyes, in complete indifference to everything.
 The Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk tries to examine this reality in the value system of man and humanity, doing so imperceptibly, without sharp emphases, but not forgetting for a moment that the "impoverished and faded", "environment of moderate need" Kars's lost beauty and prosperity were conditioned primarily by Armenians. in the presence of.
  An "imperceptible" remark of removal. "There were people who lived here from the time of the Armenian state, some of the monasteries they built 1000 years ago still stand in all their glory" (3,27).
  Thus, in the pages of the novel, the Armenian theme continues to pass, in the form of "lonely, abandoned and uninhabited ancient houses like ghosts", the dumb witnesses of the mastery of Armenian blacksmiths, "Ani ghost town".
  And one of the crowd asks the Azeri journalist a question. "Where are the millions of Armenians of Kars and Anatolia?" (3,264).
 The writer's focus is on arbitrariness, the fanaticism and backwardness of his compatriots.
 This is evidenced by the naturalists of the novel, one of whom, referring to Browning, declared: "All our attention is focused on the dangerous extremes of the universe."
 A seemingly insignificant household affair can take on a life-and-death meaning here.
  The former mayor was killed because an illegally built balcony collapsed.
 It is noteworthy that the central character of the novel, Kerim, is simply Can, has been a political exile in Germany for 12 years, or has never been involved in politics.
  Everyone arriving in the city is obliged to report to the police station according to 1940. 90% of the city media has been provided by the governor and the security department, reporting on incidents that have not yet taken place.
 The horrible thing is that the murders and suicides in the city do not surprise anyone; they take place for no apparent reason, as if self-evident phenomena that have entered everyday life and become an integral part of everyday life.
  Some of his poems have been interpreted as "A place where there is no Allah."
 Kars generalizes the unhappy, discouraged, failed, despairing people of many cities of the country, whose faces are the eternal seal of defeat.
Somewhere in the novel, Marquez's epic-political scenario is played out, which, by the way, had artistic repercussions in different literatures of the world, proving the alogism, anti-popular content, "theatrical revolutions" typical of modern public administration systems.
 The writer is convinced: "Our pitiful life has no role in the history of mankind.
 … We will remain members of an insignificant group, drowning in their petty, senseless arguments, biting each other's throats over what women will pull on their heads. The roads will be opened, the "theatrical revolution" will end "/ 3, 272 /.
The translator of the works of Chekhov, Shukshin, Aytmatov and Marquez was Akram Aylisli, whose novel "Stone Dreams" was based on 1988-90. It is a reference to the Armenian-Azerbaijani "coexistence", the Armenian massacres in Sumgait and Baku, adding to the deep-rooted traces of the massacres of the Armenians of Nakhichevan at the beginning of the last century.
 The novel was masterfully translated from the Russian original by Artak Vardanyan.
 In an interview with the British "Independent" newspaper, the writer said that his book is about "reconciliation".
 In another interview, the writer says that the decision to publish this book, written years ago, was prompted by the incident with Ramil Safarov, so typical of the decades-long relationship between the two neighboring nations.
  "When I saw the crazy reaction and the deliberate and deliberately inflamed madness between the Armenians and the Azeris, I decided to publish my novel," he writes / 4,5 /.
  We think that the novel is one of the serious, impartial and courageous deeds of our days, dedicated to the memory of the compatriots, the Armenians of Agulis who "left an irreparable pain leaving them".
 The microcosm of the writer is Agulis, who was "forcibly converted and expelled from Armenia."
  More than two decades after the horrific crimes committed, the writer repents, "as if following the biblical wisdom that confession of truth liberates itself" (4: 8-9).
 All the characters in the novel are unhappy in their own way, from the executioners to the victims.
 The stigma of curse and misfortune is forever imprinted on the foreheads of the souls of people and their generations who were guided by blind hatred and bigotry, violated the centuries-old universal laws of coexistence and religious tolerance.
  According to the author, the saddest page in the story of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza is reminded of Saday Sadighli, who was brutally beaten to protect the decapitated corpse of an Armenian old man and taken to hospital. With every Armenian tortured and killed in a giant city, it was as if they were being tortured and killed.
 In this atmosphere of permissiveness and crime, "any person can be easily wiped off the face of the earth if no one is standing behind him" / 4, 30 /.
 Unfortunately, the human being easily adapts to the atmosphere around him, but the doctor who returned from Moscow managed to change his attitude towards "religion, homeland, the Prophet himself" within 3 years, which had caused his personal tragedy.
 It is typical that Aylisli sees the fall of a person in general. People, Armenians or Azeris, walk around with other fanatical crowds, herds.
"And the full right to speak, shout, glorify was given only to those crowds.
  It was strange that the number of words uttered by these creatures was equal to the number of words that were probably used by the ancients during the hunt "(4: 63-64).
 Since losing consciousness, actor Saday, in whose family no one has had at least a drop of Armenian blood, is either in Aulis-Aylis or in his thoughts, taking the road to Etchmiadzin, preparing to repent and convert.
 Dr. Abasali is also a follower of high universal values, whose likes and dislikes have nothing to do with either Armenians or Muslims. "It was, rather, a unique" genuine "manifestation of my faithfulness to the truth" / 4, 94 /.
  Based on his long-standing remarks, he was convinced that the memory of the killed Armenians could not rest on the Turks living in their houses. "There are mentally ill people in the families of others who have occupied an Armenian house.
 "No man in Aylis, who at that time intended to reform his life through violence against Armenians, still has no rest" / 4, 85-86 /.
 It is noteworthy that in another novel written in a completely different spirit and style by Elif աֆafak's novel ընկ Istanbul's friend / 2006 /, the plot knots also lead to the idea of ​​inevitable retribution, while its central character, Mustafa, was estranged from his family in an attempt to free himself from the nightmare of the past.
The image of Agulis and his natives is drawn with high inspiration, people who have never stopped building their miraculous churches, writing their books, worshiping their God, the author writes through one of his heroes that true love knows no boundaries. "Aids is a pure mirror, where only kindness and mercy are reflected" / 4, 70 /.
 The novel "Stone Dreams" was written with such high love and devotion.
Thus, contemporary fiction has actively undertaken a great mission. Witnessing the destruction of high culture, the undermining of the very foundations of human existence, it, as a counterbalance, has a pronounced tendency to reveal eternal truths, timeless values.
 Sometimes the political saturation inherent in these works begins to work to the detriment of their artistic aspects, as seen in Guarch's novels (The Armenian Will, White Mountain).
 In this case, it is appropriate to recall Stendhal's remark, quoting Orhan Pamuk: "Politics in literature sounds as rough as a gun fired during a concert, but that is what we can not ignore" / 3, 9 /.
A tendency is becoming more and more general, according to which the Armenian Genocide, more than ever, receives pleas with the distorted nature of the human being, allows us to recognize ourselves as valued "from outside".
What happened cannot be ignored, as the "unhealed wound" remains, which is "enriched" with new facts of human demoralization and retreat.
 Unpunished and unpunished crime is continuous… Hence its universal significance, which is well realized by the writers of the world; The existence of every individual, of the society is endangered, it is time to stop, because the exploding mine is right next to us.
 On the other hand, man is threatened by the catastrophe of becoming a zombie, which is manifested by the emptiness of his eyes, by complete indifference to everything.
  The modern novel, turning to the reinterpretation of the past, becomes even more complex and ambiguous, as the consumption of humanistic civilization is obvious, the impossibility of human understanding even within the same ethnic boundaries.
 The distance of decades does not dampen the pain of losses, և nowadays it becomes more and more urgent to strive to express the necessary things seriously. The past suddenly emerges in our present, և humanity often finds itself in the same magical framework of questions.
