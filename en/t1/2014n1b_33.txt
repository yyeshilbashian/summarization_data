Technology is an integrated, diverse subject that encompassesGraphics / drawing /, materials processing technologies, elements of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, radio engineering, economicsbasics, clothing modeling և preparation, cooking, construction repair և finishing work, agricultural work և etc.
 It plays an important role in the Technology coursegraphics.
 The brightest way to teach "Technology"Interdisciplinary connections emerge between material science, physics, mathematics and other subjects.
The implementation of modern requirements for secondary schools raises new issues in the teaching of subjects.
  Revised և Serious changesto be done in school curricula and textbooks.
However, studies show that educationalThe methods of teaching most subjects are not sufficient և do not meet the modern requirements for teaching.
We have studied in several schools in Yerevan"Technology" դր The position of organizing the teaching of "Geometry" subjects.
  It turns out that the relevant departments of the Pedagogical University should take the teaching of these subjects seriously.To improve the situation in the general education schools of the republicprovide methodological assistance.
Interdisciplinary connections, which are one of the necessary conditions for learning success, should be given a special place in the learning process.
On Interdisciplinary Relationships Y. Komensky in his work "The Great Didactics" notes that the interconnected teaching of subjects teaches children to discover the connections between the phenomena of the subjects being studied. "Strengthen everything On the basis of intelligence means to learn everything - pointing doing the reasons, that is, not just showing how this or that isThe thing is happening, but to show why it can not be otherwise.
After all, to know something means to recognize the thing as its interconnectednessin. "
Interdisciplinary connections exist especially in technology,Mathematics, geometry, fine arts, physics.
The knowledge, skills և skills acquired during the teaching of each of these subjects are widely used in the other in the process of teaching subjects.
"Graphics" department training is needed in "Technology" classesto organize learners' workskills, develop technical thinking, design skills, spatial perceptions, creative thinking.
  Most of the classes in the "Graphics" section are neededto organize in organic connection with other departments of "Technology",which will enable the development of such qualities of learners assuch as understanding the role և meaning of drawings, their application,the ability to read the drawing.
Let's bring an example. Students in "Technology" classes must prepare a "Kitchen Shovel".
  It must be wooden.
 A technological card is being drawn up.
 [3]As we can see, the interdisciplinary connections are vividly expressed in the card.
 The learner constructs graphic images.
Such interactions deepen և strengthen the graphic, working, skills, knowledge of the learners.
Students make various details, objects from wood and metals in "Technology" classes and educational workshops.
  The process of preparing an item consists of the following actions (operations):• reading the drawing of the subject to be prepared; • Selection of preparation sizes (according to the dimensions of the drawing);• material processing (sawing, drilling, etc.);• Check the size of the prepared object according to the drawing.
By reading the drawing, an idea is formed in the learnerson the spatial structure of the subject to be prepared.
 In addition, according to the drawing, the student must choose the methods of processing.
 Along with reading the drawing, students perform with the marking tools on the product (marker, dot marker, marker, etc.)They measure.
An analysis of the technological process of making a subject is important when getting acquainted with the sequence of actions of making a subject.
This analysis is performed with the help of technological cards, which contain the processing sequence, drawing, tools used during the work, cutting and measuring tools.
The choice of subjects to be made should be as follows:that they are not complex in structure but consistentTo the content of the program of the subject "Technology", to have educational, practical, household significance և application.
[1]It is also useful to prepare for the training workshopneeded for subject laboratories, school needsitems, devices, didactic items, etc.
 It is known that among the main goals of the "Graphics" sectionThe fastest place belongs to drawings, especially their readingstrengthening knowledge, abilities և skills.
 Teaching technology is impossible without reading the drawings capacity building.
  This knowledge of "Graphics" teachingThey are carried out with the use of various inspection items and devices.
There is a need for a place in the implementation of these goalsAllocate to mastering the skills of working with measuring instruments.
To do this, you must first get acquainted with the basic measuring toolsհ tricks to work with them.
 It is useful to have measuring instrumentsTraining posters showing workmanship, with linear dimensions, inside և outside diameters, holesDetermination of չափ other dimensions of center distances (Fig. 1) [2].
An example of an axono-class of the device is shown.
Lesson material. Stand design երեք preparation of three dimensions of projections.
  The teacher explains the lessonthe goal.
metric projection (Fig. 2).
        Students together with the teacherThey choose the spatial dimensions of the device, according to which they choose. "the structural dimensions of its parts.
 Students perform during the lessonsSketches of details, drawings / Fig.3/.
 Figure 1:Figure 2:3. Pillar(wood material)2 piecesFigure 3:According to the drawing, under the guidance of the teacher, the students prepare the details of the device and assemble them with screws on the stand.
Most technology classes are pre-arrangedwith drawings.
The learner studies the subject, device model drawing.
 Imagines the proposed construction.
 Choosestools և go to the preparation of the subject.
It is obvious that this is possible when the learner has sufficient knowledge and skills to read drawings.
Learning to draw drawings is successfully accomplished through exercises that include elements of comparison, transformations, and modeling.
An example of drawing drawings using the modeling method is shownfig. In 4.
 A regular triangular prism is divided into two parts:one (upper part) is divided into five parts.
Fig. 4:The two projections of the model consisting of several particles are given / fig. 5.1 /.
 The students study the projections, imagine the structure of the subject և assemble the model / Fig.5.2/.
Figure 5:In conclusion, it should be noted that the technology classes of "Technology" are methodically correctThe organization significantly develops և deepens the theoretical-practical knowledge, abilities, capacities of the learners,skills, spatial perceptions, imagination և thinking.
