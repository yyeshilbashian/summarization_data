Patterns of population development in generalThey are conditioned by biological, demographic, socio-economic, caring, cultural and psychological factors.
  HistoricallyThe transition periods of public life have a certain influence on the change of the population.
 In the present territory of Armenia in the XX century. Three crucial turning points took place during that period, which significantly changed the demographic conditions of the population of the republic.
  It is noteworthy that the stages of demographic transition in the country are chronologicalcoincided with the transition periods of public life.
The first transition period covers 1914-1920, which are ArmenianThose were the nightmarish years of the people.
    The Turkish government systematically and systematically annihilated more than 1.5 million Armenians.
This is evidenced by Turkish Interior Minister Talaatone of the telegrams. "It simply came to our notice then
to end the existence of Armenians.
 Pay no attention to age, noto sex, nor to the sting of conscience. ”[16]
The second transition period was the first 20 years of Sovietization, when there was a transition from capitalism to socialism, that is,The 1920s and 1930s included NTCs and industrializationand the years of collectivization when radical change took placeThey had them not only in the economy, but also in the demographic conditions of the population.
The third transition period covers 1988-2003, when the newly independentThere was a change of society in Armenia, a transition from socialism to capitalism.
  In addition, in 1988 Due to the Artsakh movement, the wrong national policy of the Soviet government
Hundreds of thousands of Armenians emigrated from Azerbaijan to Armenia.
Since the outbreak of World War I, Western Armenia1914-1916 were fatal for the population, and 1918-1920 in Eastern Armenia.
 In those years from Turkey, including ArmeniaFrom Armenia to the Caucasus և Eastern Armenia What is the number of migrants, it is still not clear.
 Professor H. According to Tumanyan, in 1914-1920. 350 emigrated from Western Armenia to the Caucasus
Thousands of Armenians, most of whom settled in Armenia, and Z. Korkotyan mentions that the number of immigrants who took refuge in Armenia in 1916 amounted to 200 thousand [8].
  Elsewhere it is mentioned that during the mentioned period 500-600 thousand people migrated from Western Armenia to the Caucasus.350 thousand of them left for the North Caucasus and Georgia, and 200Thousands settled in Armenia.
  P. Abelyan mentions that
In Eastern Armenia in 1916 The number of emigrants was 116 thousand.
 1915According to the incomplete data of the statistical survey of January 30, the number of migrants from Turkey and Persia was 67 thousand, of which50 thousand Armenians [11].
 There were so many refugees that the command of the Caucasian Front in 1915 He had to create the main authority for "reception and accommodation of migrants".
 According to the data of that authority, in 1916 As of January 1, 2010, the number of migrants settled in the Caucasus was 182.8 thousand, of which 105 thousand were settled.
in Yerevan, and the rest in Elizavetpol և Batumi, Kars ևIn the regions of Kuban [1].
 Until 1923 Sheltered in the North Caucasus
Most of the Armenian emigrants wanted to return to Armenia.
The situation has been changing since 1923.
  On the one hand, economic in the regionThe stabilization of the situation, the provision of employment for the Armenian population, the mastery of the Russian language, and on the other hand, the large number of migrants who have not yet received their land due to the scarcity of land in Armenia.Their existence created preconditions for them not to return to Soviet Armenia.
 Due to the emigration of the population from ArmeniaThere was a natural disaster.
 Promoted emigration in 1915. The Alexandropol earthquake.
  As a result, 15,000 people fled to the NorthCaucasus և other countries.
  Most of them later returned.
The population of Armenia in 1918 in recent months, according to the current
According to the census data, together with the migrants it was 1306.7 thousand.people [3].
Armenia, 1918-1920 Being independent, waging war against Turkey, Georgia and Azerbaijan, it had great human losses.
During the two years of independence, the absolute population of the republic decreased by about 600 thousand or 40.5%.
  1920 last:
Turkish troops invading Armenia, hundreds of thousands of Armenians They were killed and as many fled to the North Caucasus.
 In particular, the massacres reached great proportions in the province of Alexandropol.
  A. Mravyan said
data on the case of migrants in the province of Alexandropolfrom the results of the work of the dealing commission.
  According to them, the Turks massacred 60 thousand people in the province, the number of wounded was 38 thousand[18] There were 18,000 captives and 32,000 starved to death.
Sovietization of Armenia (second transitional period) created favorable conditions for population growthfor.
 Suffice it to say that only in 1922-1929. 20.3 thousand Armenians returned to Soviet Armenia from abroad.
  In the RepublicThe population growth trend was maintained in the 1930s.
  19211988 The population of Armenia has decreased. only the Great Patriotic War
during the war, by about 75.7 thousand.
 Post-war yearHundreds of thousands of Armenians from different countries of the world came to Armenia:permanent residence.
  It is worth mentioning that in 1949 All of Leninakan
More than 10% of the population were Diaspora Armenians.
  From Table 1It seems that in 1920-1989. The population increased by 2584.8
by a thousand or 4.6 times.

  If in 19931999 emigration was mainly labor emigration,
then in 1999 then it transforms into a kind of permanent emigration.
2001 in Armenia According to the first census, the de jure population was 3.2 million.
    According to our expert assessment, in 1993-2011. The real population of the republic
The number has decreased by about 1.4 million people.
  2011 in Armenia According to the preliminary results of the census, the current population was:
2875.4 thousand people, and in 2001 3002.6 thousand people.
 That is,The absolute number of the current population has decreased in 10 yearsby 127.2 thousand or 4.2%.
XX century in Armenia Birth rate of the population was recorded
gradual decline.
 Thus, in 1911-1914. In our republic, 1554-year-old women gave birth on average during their married life
7.2 children [8], in 1926-1939 - respectively 7.5, in the 1980s - 3.5 և XXI c. At the beginning, 1.7 children [7].
  Such tendencies first ևpreviously conditioned by the increase of women's educational level.
Thus, in 1979 The average woman with higher education gave birth
1.59, those with incomplete higher education - 1.83, general secondaryThose with education - 1.67, those with incomplete secondary education - 2.16,those with primary education - 4.13; those without education - 5.12 children.
 In the first և second transitional periods of public lifeHigh birth rates were registered in the republic, and in the thirdon the contrary, low indicators (see Table 2).
           In the second transitional period, 1926-1930, during the years of economic recovery, industrialization և rural collectivization, the birth rate in Armenia reached its peak in 1926, amounting to 56.1 ‰.
  However, in the 1930s the birth rate of the population decreased. its:
S. Strumilin considers the main reason to be the welfare of the peoplegrowth [8].
  There has also been a decline in the birth rate. "in the following years.
In addition to all this, let us mention that after the Sovietization, untilThe 1930s were still preserved in our republicthe traditional type of family.
  Communist ideologyAfter making it a way of life, the Armenian family also changes.
  BeginsThe destruction of the traditional family, that is, the family.
  There is a transition from a large family to a middle one, and in the third transition period to a small one.
  The vast majority of girls in pre-Soviet ArmeniaHe got married at the age of 15-16, in 1930, respectively20, 1939 - 22 [8], 1960 - 27 [20], 1986 - 26, 1991 և 2001 at the age of 27.
Thus, in 1939-2001. under 18 years of age
The share of married women decreased from 35.1% to 0.3%, and 18-24on the contrary, it increased from 43.9% to 79.9%.

It takes place in the public life of that periodchanges.
  Historically, the pattern of mortality in Armenia has been conditioned by the countrywith changes in population and economic development.
In the XX century it had a mortality rate of the population of the republicThere are both growth and decline tendencies.
 1911-1914 in Armenia և:
1921-1925 The mortality rate was 18.2 ‰, in 1985-1989 - 5.8 ‰ (see:
Table 2) և 2001-2006 was 8.0 ‰ [15].
  Mortality rate:For well-known reasons, it was especially high in the First Republicyears.
During the Soviet era, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s, low mortality rates were dueWith the high standard of living of the population, people have fully enjoyed the right to rest and received quality medical care.
 It is known to be peacefulMost of the dead are under the age of fourchildren և the elderly.
  A study of population mortality shows that if in the second transition period:In 1926, 61.4% of the total number of deaths in our republic,In 1940, 56.4% were under the age of 4, then the thirdIn the transition phase, the picture is quite the opposite: in 1990. 63.6% of the total number of deaths 78 in 2006 - 78.1% respectively
They fall on people over the age of 60. [15]
According to statistics, since the 1930s,A decrease in natural growth was registered in the republic (see chartIn 1).
  And in the third transition phase, there is a rapid decline in natural growthregister.
  Thus, if in 1990 The natural population growth in our republic was 16.3 ‰, then in 2005 it was only 3.5 ‰.
The demographic situation deteriorated, first due to a decrease in the birth rate from 22.5 ((1990) to, 10.1 2002 (2002).աճ with an increase in mortality, respectively 6.2 ‰ և 8.0 ‰.
Figure 1 shows that in 2000-2004. natural growth rate almost
equated to mortality.
  If this trend continuesIt is possible that the number of deaths in the country after 2015The number of births will exceed, as an increase in the number of elderly people will be registered during that period, as a result of which it is assumed thatIncreased mortality in contrast to declining birth rates.

 "They testify to that."the data in Table 2.
  And that means Armeniaenters the next, fourth stage of the demographic transition, as:is known in the scientific literature as "demographic winter" orThe stage of "demographic depopulation".
  As a consequence, if the population of the republic has been decreasing since the 1990sexclusively at the expense of the emigrating population, then in 2015 after that
The negative balance of natural growth can be added.
