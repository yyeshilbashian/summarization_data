In general, the patterns of population development are conditioned by biological, demographic, socio-economic, emotional, cultural and psychological factors.
  Historically, the transition periods of public life have a certain influence on the change of the population.
 In the present territory of Armenia in the XX century. Three crucial turning points took place during that period, which significantly changed the demographic conditions of the population of the republic.
  It is noteworthy that the stages of demographic transition in the republic coincided chronologically with the transition periods of public life.
The first transition period covers 1914-1920, which were the nightmarish years of the life of the Armenian people.
    The Turkish government systematically and systematically annihilated more than 1.5 million Armenians.
Evidence of this is one of the telegrams of the Turkish Minister of Internal Affairs Talaat. "No matter how cruel the measures taken, the existence of Armenians must end.
 Pay no attention to age, gender, or conscience. ”[16]
The second transition period was the first 20 years of Sovietization, when the transition from capitalism to socialism took place, that is, the 1920s and 1930s included the years of NTC, industrialization and collectivization, when radical changes took place not only in the economy but also in the demographic conditions of the population.
The third transition period includes 1988-2003, when a change of society took place in newly independent Armenia, a transition from socialism to capitalism.
  In addition, in 1988 Due to the Artsakh movement, dictated by the wrong national policy of the Soviet government, hundreds of thousands of Armenians emigrated from Azerbaijan to Armenia.
From the beginning of the First World War, 1914-1916 were crucial for the population of Western Armenia, and 1918-1920 for Eastern Armenia.
 In those years, the exact number of emigrants from Turkey, including Western Armenia to the Caucasus and Eastern Armenia, has not been determined yet.
 Professor H. According to Tumanyan, in 1914-1920. 350,000 Armenians migrated from Western Armenia to the Caucasus, most of whom settled in Armenia, and Z. Korkotyan mentions that the number of immigrants who took refuge in Armenia in 1916 amounted to 200 thousand [8].
  Elsewhere it is mentioned that during the mentioned period 500-600 thousand people migrated from Western Armenia to the Caucasus, of which 350 thousand left for the North Caucasus and Georgia, and 200 thousand settled in Armenia.
  P. Abelyan mentions that in Archelyan Armenia in 1916 The number of emigrants was 116 thousand.
 According to the incomplete data of the statistical survey of January 30, 1915, the number of emigrants from Turkey and Persia was 67 thousand, of which 50 thousand were Armenians.
 There were so many refugees that the command of the Caucasian Front in 1915 He had to create the main authority for "reception and accommodation of migrants".
 According to the data of that authority, in 1916 As of January 1, 2012, the number of migrants settled in the Caucasus was 182.8 thousand, of which 105 thousand settled in Yerevan, and the rest in the provinces of Elizavetpol և Batumi, Kars և Kuban [1].
 Until 1923 Most of the Armenian migrants who took refuge in the North Caucasus wanted to return to Armenia.
The situation has been changing since 1923.
  On the one hand, the stabilization of the economic situation in the region, the provision of employment for the Armenian population, the mastery of the Russian language, and on the other hand, the large number of migrants who have not yet received land in Armenia due to scarcity created preconditions for them not to return to Soviet Armenia.
 The emigration of the population from Armenia was conditioned by a natural disaster.
 Promoted emigration in 1915. The Alexandropol earthquake.
  As a result, 15,000 people left for the North Caucasus and other countries.
  Most of them later returned.
The population of Armenia in 1918 In recent months, according to the current census, together with migrants, it amounted to 1306.7 thousand people.
Armenia, 1918-1920 Being independent, waging war against Turkey, Georgia and Azerbaijan, it had great human losses.
During the two years of independence, the absolute population of the republic decreased by about 600 thousand or 40.5%.
  1920 The last Turkish troops invaded Armenia, killed hundreds of thousands of Armenians, and as many fled to the North Caucasus.
 In particular, the massacres reached great proportions in the province of Alexandropol.
  A. Mravyan testifies to the results of the work of the commission dealing with migrants in the province of Alexandropol.
  According to them, the Turks massacred 60,000 people in the province, the number of wounded was 38,000, the captives were 18,000, and the number of those who died of starvation was 32,000.
The sovietization of Armenia (second transitional period) created favorable conditions for the increase of the population.
 Suffice it to say that only in 1922-1929. 20.3 thousand Armenians returned to Soviet Armenia from abroad.
  The population growth trend of the Republic was maintained in the 1930s.
  19211988 The population of Armenia has decreased. only during the Great Patriotic War, by about 75.7 thousand.
 Hundreds of thousands of Armenians from different countries of the world came to Armenia for permanent residence.
  It is worth mentioning that in 1949 More than 10% of the population of Leninakan were Diaspora Armenians.
  Table 1 shows that in 1920-1989. The population increased by 2584.8 thousand or 4.6 times.
Table 1 Movement of the population of the Republic of Armenia in transitional regions (1913, 1918, 1920, 1926, 1989, 1992, 2001, 2001)
  Spitak 1988 Armenia, which was severely affected by the December 2012 earthquake (according to official figures, the death toll from the quake was about 25,000 [4] and unofficially, 55,000 [22]), had to withstand a strong wave of immigration and more than half deported from Azerbaijan in just four years. million Armenians, 360 thousand of whom settled in our republic.

1994 It accepted about 420,000 refugees.
  That is, in a short period of time, the population of the republic increased by 12.3% in terms of immigration. The population of the republic, according to the current census, was about 3.8 million people.
  However, along with immigration, in 1991 Since then, the number of emigrants in the republic has been increasing due to political, socio-economic, moral-psychological-war factors.
  If in 19931999 Emigration was mainly labor emigration, then in 1999. then it transforms into a kind of permanent emigration.
2001 in Armenia According to the first census, the de jure population was 3.2 million.
    According to our expert assessment, in 1993-2011. The real population of the republic has decreased by about 1.4 million people.
  2011 in Armenia According to the preliminary results of the census, the current population was 2875.4 thousand people. 3002.6 thousand people.
 That is, the absolute number of the current population has decreased by 127.2 thousand or 4.2% during 10 years.
XX century in Armenia There was a gradual decline in the birth rate of the population.
 Thus, in 1911-1914. In our republic, 1554-year-old women gave birth to an average of 7.2 children during their married life [8], in 1926-1939 - respectively 7.5, in the 1980s - 3.5 և XXI c. At the beginning, 1.7 children [7].
  Such tendencies are first of all conditioned by the increase of women's educational level.
Thus, in 1979 Women with higher education gave birth to 1.59 on average, those with incomplete higher education - 1.83, those with general secondary education - 1.67, those with incomplete secondary education - 2.16, those with primary education - 4.13 տարր those without education - 5 , 12 children [17].
 In the first and second transitional periods of public life, high birth rates were registered in the republic, and in the third and vice versa, low birth rates (see Table 2).
           In the second transitional period, 1926-1930, during the years of economic recovery, industrialization և rural collectivization, the birth rate in Armenia reached its peak in 1926, amounting to 56.1 ‰.
  However, in the 1930s the birth rate of the population decreased. S. Strumilin considers the growth of the people's welfare to be the main reason [8].
  A decline in the birth rate was registered in the following years.
In addition to all this, let us mention that after the Sovietization, until the 1930s, the traditional type of family was still preserved in our republic.
  After turning the communist ideology into a way of life, the Armenian family also changes.
  The disintegration of the traditional family, that is, the family, begins.
  There is a transition from a large family to a middle one, and in the third transition period to a small one.
  In pre-Soviet Armenia, the vast majority of girls were married at the age of 15-16, in 1930 - 20 respectively, in 1939 - 22 [8], in 1960 - 27 [20], in 1986 - 26, in 1991. և 2001 at the age of 27.
Thus, in 1939-2001. The proportion of underage women under the age of 18 decreased from 35.1% to 0.3%, while that of 18-24 year olds increased from 43.9% to 79.9%.

L. Davtyan, Reproduction of the population of Soviet Armenia, Yer. 1965, V. Khojabekyan, The Reproduction and Movements of the Population of Armenia in the XIX-XX Centuries on the Threshold of the XXI Century, Yerevan, 2001, Population of the USSR 1987, M. 1988, materials.
It shows the changes taking place in the public life of that period.
  Historically, the patterns of mortality in the population of Armenia have been conditioned by changes in the level of population and economic development.
In the twentieth century, the mortality rate of the population of the republic had both increasing and decreasing tendencies.
 1911-1914 in Armenia 211921-1925 The mortality rate was 18.2 ‰, in 1985-1989 - 5.8 տ (see Table 2) և 2001-2006. was 8.0 ‰ [15].
  The mortality rate was especially high during the years of the First Republic for well-known reasons.
During the Soviet years, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s, the low mortality rate was due to the high standard of living of the population, people fully enjoyed the right to rest and received quality medical care.
 It is known that a large number of those who died in peacetime are children under four years old and the elderly.
  The study of population mortality shows that if in the second transition period, in 1926, 61.4% of the total number of deaths in our country, in 1940, 56.4% fell to the age of 4, then in the third transition the picture is quite the opposite. is 1990 63.6% of the total death toll և in 2006 - 78.1% respectively fell to people over 60 years of age.
According to statistics, since the 1930s, there has been a decrease in natural growth in the republic (see Figure 1).
  And in the third transitional phase, a rapid decline in natural growth was registered.
  Thus, if in 1990 The natural population growth in our republic was 16.3 ‰, then in 2005 it was only 3.5 ‰.
The demographic situation worsened, first due to a decrease in the birth rate from 22.5 ((1990) to և 10.1 2002 (2002) աճ mortality, to 6.2 և և 8.0 աբար, respectively.
Figure 1 shows that in 2000-2004. Natural growth rate is almost equal to mortality.
  If such a trend continues, it is possible that the number of deaths in the country after 2015 will exceed the number of births, as during that period there will be an increase in the number of elderly people, which will lead to an increase in deaths in contrast to the declining birth rate.

Natural increaseMortality The demographic situation deteriorated, first due to a decrease in the birth rate from 22.5 ((1990) to 10.1 ‰ (2002) աճ an increase in mortality to 6.2 ‰ և 8.0 համապատասխան, respectively.
Figure 1 shows that in 2000-2004. Natural growth rate is almost equal to mortality.
  If such a trend continues, it is possible that the number of deaths in the country after 2015 will exceed the number of births, as during that period there will be an increase in the number of elderly people, which will lead to an increase in deaths in contrast to the declining birth rate.
 This is evidenced by the data in Table 2.
  And this means that Armenia is entering the next, fourth stage of the demographic transition, as it is known in the scientific literature, the stage of "demographic winter" or "demographic depopulation".
  As a consequence, if since 1990 the population of the republic has been decreasing exclusively at the expense of the emigrating population, then in 2015 then the negative balance of natural growth can be added to it.
