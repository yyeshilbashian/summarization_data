In the article, the examination is performed according to the structural factor of different words, differentiating the analytical complexities of adjective // ​​macabre.
The idioms of this kind of words are behind the historical development of the idiom.
  Over time, the semantic structure of a word can change if the word is used in the role of another object.
 In this case, the word acquires a new meaning, "moreover, this new meaning can be an extension of the already existing meaning of the word, can combine the meaning of the word, coexist with it, can replace it, etc." [1].
Changes in this type of lexicon can affect the word value. In this case, either their verbal meaning changes or they include other value or values.
If more than one grammatical meaning is present in the semantic structure of words, then such words are considered as lexical miscellaneous words, and the grammatical reality is considered lexical misalignment [2].
Verbal ambiguity covers both the sphere of materially meaningful words and the sphere of service words.
Words with material meaning are of interest to adjectives // Maccabees.
 Words of this kind play a dual role, performing special positions on the adjective և macabre at the syntactic level.
In the Armenian reality, the words combining adjective // ​​macabre values ​​were considered adjectives, which, preserving their main lexical meaning և grammatical features, acquired a new function - macabre usage [3].
As noted in the linguistic literature, such words can have both determinative and subjunctive functions, as well as case functions.
The adjective // ​​macabay's's's's's's's's's համար համար բ մակ մակ բ։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։
  "Փոխանց Verbal transmission goes a long way և implies a period of transition, when the given word as an adjective և as a macabre can have parallel verbal values.
  And not only in Eastern Armenian, but also in different stages of the Armenian language, a number of more commonly used adjectives have a pronounced macabre meaning beyond the word….
 Moreover, some of them have more macabre verbal value than the adjective… "[5].
It is natural that the adjective // ​​macabay's word-variable words, due to the initial word-mass value, are divided into two groups: adjective և maccabay words of origin.
In the present article, we will examine these words not according to the source or derivative speech patterns, but according to the structural factor of long words, distinguishing between analytical complexities.
The analytical complexities, which are characterized by the mass value of speech, are duplicate or nominal relations.
Duplicate Complications Among the analytical complications, the words that are duplicate formations are distinguished by their verbal-mass difference.
 Repetitions are manifestations of one of the oldest means of word formation, repetition, which undergoes semantic development throughout the history of language.
 The nuances of the lexicon can lead to the components of the double complexity acquiring a new meaning, moving away from the original meanings.
  However, this new meaning is more or less related to their original meaning.
Among the recurring complications, we single out the compounds whose components are used separately.
 It is noticeable that such compounds are soundless formations.
Unvoiced duplicate complications, which express verbal disparity, are formed by the repetition of noun adjectives.
1) Some of the complications consisting of the repetition of a noun have a long meaning. The adjectives "take on the meaning of diversity, plurality", as if they "show a sequence of things of the same nationality" [6].
 Repetitives are usually made up of nouns that express a collective, such as group, flock, ball, bunch, as they have the meaning of quantity, volume, handful, thread, and so on.
 Among those words are: group-group, flock-flock, ball-ball, thread-thread, hand-hand, bunch և etc.
     Consider these difficulties in the field of syntactic application.
Handful - handful of tears (adjective)
handful - handful of sprinkling (mkb.) group - group of girls (adjective)
flock - flock (flock) flock - flock of birds (adjective)
flock - flock (mkb.) ball - ball dough (adjective)
gund - gund darsel (mkb.) thread - thread hair (ts.) thread - thread white (mkb.)
bouquet - bouquet of flowers (adjective)
bunch - bunch to tie (mkb.) Hmmt. A handful - a. a lot, abundant. Mother and daughter shed tears under the dull rays inside the window (VT, 570).
 m. abundantly, abundantly. Or the sledgehammers sift through the roofs, through the open porch, scattering them hand in hand (PS, D, 116).
Bunch - bunch - a. sort-sort. The clinking of glasses should be mixed with… Bunch-bunch of Tsaghkots songs (PS, D, 116).
 m. in groups, in bunches. The fragrant flame of the eucalyptus and the candle is marching, blooming like a flower, bright and yellow like a flower (PS, D, 95).
2) Complications of adjective repetition's adjectives "intensify the meaning of adjectives by adding a repetition of action" [7].
Such complications are the following adjectives: high, very, sad, hot, sharp, big, new, long, heavy, cold, etc.
Complications consisting of such adjectives are high-high, very-very, sad-sad, hot-hot, sharp-sharp, big-big, new-new, long-lasting, heavy-heavy, cold-cold, etc.
The macabre value of words of this kind is conditioned by the ability to express the macabre meaning of root components (adjectives), such as to speak loudly խոսել to speak loudly, to dress warmly և to dress warmly, to write a lot գրել to write a lot, to sit sadly և to grieve [8] .
Consider the variability of such complications at the syntactic level.
thin - thin fingers (ad.)
thin - thin spin (mkb.) heavy - heavy stones (ts.) heavy - heavy move (mkb.)
high - high mountains (adj.)
sing loudly (mkb.)
many - many books (ad.)
write a lot (mkb.) sad - sad look (adjective)
sad - sad sit (mkb.) new - new clothes (adjective)
new - new to wear (mkb.) long - long stick (ts.) long - long to tell (mkb.)
cold - cold food (adjective)
cold - eat cold (mkb.) Hmmt. Hot - a. hot, just taken from the fire. (Iritzkin) He took a warm lavash, a flower lavash from the tonir and spread it, the sweet smell of Norahat caught the door handle (AI, 1, 27).
 m. 1. very hot. "By the way, the king sent me a hot bath" (HC, 3, 170).
 2. Passionate, excited, furious. They speak warmly (HT, 6, 38).
Big-big - a. 1. sharp-sharp, beyond its power. Oh, you devil, do you want to deceive me too, to close my eyes with big words (HT, 2, 99).
 2. Large, huge. And immediately all the dailies of my world shout… In capital letters (PS, D, 303).
 m. boasting, arrogantly. Both of them were stubbornly proud and proud, they argued fiercely (HT, 1, 288).
Speech-like: ած.// մկբ. Some duplicate complications, the second component of which is altered sound, also reveal a difference.
With such complications, "the meaning of the word is acquired, an object is taken with its similarities, its accessories, or a property with similar or similar properties."
Unvoiced duplicates express only plurality, and transliterated complexities expand the original meaning, giving it additional nuances, such as minimal, short, severe, etc. [10]
 Such complications in the role of filling in subject words show the adjective, in the role of filling in the verb, the macro value of macabre.
Among those words are telik-melik, sur-mour, coil-molor, sweet-honey, thin-marak, parap-sarap, susik-pusik և etc.
Consider the lexical difference of these words in the syntactic sphere.
thread - melik movement (adjective)
thread - melik move (mcb.) {
False story entry (adjective)
to tell a lie (mkb.) twisted way (adjective)
to go astray (mkb.) sweet-honey tongue (adjective) sweet-honey to speak (mkb.)
Thin-thin path (adj.)
thin - dark stretch (mkb.) susik - pusik girl (adjective) susik - pusik work (mkb.)
Hmmt. Idleness - a. idle The shepherd's gampr is playful and thoughtful, and the idle gentleman's dog is lazy and capricious (HT, 3, 126).
m. without work, idle. I am tired of sitting idle like this (HT, 3, 127).
Susik-pusik -a. silent and silent, modest, taciturn. He was as shy as Ara, Self-contained and whispering, Erazik was the opposite… (PS, G, 59).
m. without making a sound, by default. His wife also disappeared from the side, Who knows what hole she found (HT, 1, 341).
Thus, duplication of speech-language differences is divided into two groups. Complications consisting of non-volatile components;
Unvoiced duplicates are made up of repetitions of either nouns or adjectives, and the components of a diminutive duplicate are adjectives.
Nominal relations Some of the nominal relations are expressed in echochemical mass: ap.//mkb. exchange rate.
  These are words that are made up of adjectives.
 It is noticeable that ած .// մկբ. Variability is expressed by those composed of qualitative adjective components.
  Moreover, these formations have the peculiarities that each of the components of the complexity of the constraint, as a separate verbal unit, shows ats.//mkb. longevity.
         Among such relative complications are: homeless, homeless, sad, long-slender, half-dressed, rough-faced, obedient, etc. [11].
As adjectives, these words express a strong meaning, as's macabre, they are characterized by the feature of the horse's case.
Hmmt. homeless (child, wander), sad (thoughts, go), long-thin (story, talk), half-baked (work, do), harsh (attitude, treat), obedient (servant) , serve).
Nominal relative difficulties can occur and (sometimes և) in conjunction, again preserving dichotomous verbal values, such as homeless, sad-sad, long-thin, cheerful, rough and tumble, half-baked, obedient հ etc.
Prove relevant original examples.
Happy and cheerful - a. happy, fun, pleasant. And with a noise, with a happy merry cry, a large crowd floods the house of the bridegroom through the village of the bridegroom (PS, D, 112).
 m. very happy, with joy. (Varos) worked at home and at home with double-breasted, happy and cheerful (AI, JBB).
Sadness - a. very sad, sad. Dear mother, I am divorced, sad, I do not sleep (AI, A, 33).
 m. very sadly, sadly. Always striking the stone-rock of Angut conscience of this world, you go to Sadness, Araz (AI, A, 119).
Thus, adjective // ​​macabay's's's's's's's's's։։։,։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։։
At the same time, in terms of speech, at.//mkb. Analytical complexities showing diversity are divided into two groups: duplicate relations հար nominal relations.
