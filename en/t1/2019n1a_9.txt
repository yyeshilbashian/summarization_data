Useful when searching for minesThe search for the content of the elements has recently begunmore:Extensive use of nuclear geophysical methodsin particular, the X-ray radiometric method (X-ray method).
  This:method based on the primary radioactive sourcechemical analysisCharacterization obtained as a result of excitation of element atomsX-ray recording without compromising on its accuracysampling traditionalmethods,surpasses the latter in its speed and cheapness.
 RRMAnother important feature is the measurementPossibility of natural installation withoutto take and process samples.
  X-ray radiometric methodIt has been widely used in a number of mines in Armenia(Alaverdi, Shamlugh, Armanis, Ghapan, Kajaran, Hankasar)under natural conditions of copper, molybdenum, zinc,for lead sampling, during which  developedVarious methodological and practical issues have been clarified, resolved.
When the method was already developing in Armenia,It had just begun to take its first steps in southern Georgia.
To support the testing and application of RRMfor the purpose of GeorgiaGeologicalwas at the invitation of the Bolnisi Geophysical Expedition of the DepartmentWe are in a number of mines in Georgia.
  That cooperationOur first works carried out within the framework ofwere made at the Pitareti copper mine in the Bolnisi region.
 That:Exploration work at the mine was accompaniedby crossing the canal, the further works of which are correct ևThe task was set operatively for effective organizationto sample copper.
 It was clear that the chemical herea slow method of geological sampling involving analysishad to give way to the rapid X-ray radiometric method.

  Quartzite-like rocksThe belt is about 250 m wide and extends to the Khrami Rivermore than 1.5 km along the coast [1].
 The rocks of the belt are strongly crackedքերը where cracks of different orientation are filled with pyrite ևchalcopyrite, as well as a very small amount of sphalerite ևwith quartz containing galenite deposits.

  In such conditionsRRM is used for measuring spectral intensity orby means of spectral relations [2, 3].
 But given:the fact that the element to be sampled is the copper analytical lineThere was no characteristic of disturbing elements in the domain orscattering rays, we carried out the measurements technicallyeasier և simple to apply spectral intensity method.

  This means that with each otherare combined, in fact, on two different volumesThe results of the measurement performed, ie it can be stated that:X-ray radiometric in residential conditionsgeological sampling combined oris attached.
  In such cases to build reference curvesX-ray radiometric measurements with the same marking would be correctdo it twice before taking a groove sample ևafter taking it, through the bottom of the trench.
  Because of PitarettiWe did not have that opportunity in the mine, it is reliableWe did the following to get the standard curve.

  However, it should be noted that:Geologicalwhich is permissibleare trying to "fit" the RMM data within the borders,applies only to the last ring of geological samplingchemical analysis data, not the whole process.
 Process:It includes sampling and processing that they havesometimes their big mistakes.
  If even samplesMaking and processing mistakes will be reduced, it's the same,with mineralization change և unevenly distributedconditioned, geological և X-ray radiometricsampling data will have deviations from each other.
  That:deviations are particularly significant for metric intervalsduring the comparison of the obtained data.
  In such cases,as mentioned above, should be magnified for comparisontaken և averaged intervals.
  And in our opinion, RRMneeded as a criterion for assessing reliabilitytake not the average content of the element to be determined, but twothe overlap of its linear resources determined by the methods [3].
