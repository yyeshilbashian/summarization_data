Introduction.
  The results of the work done in many countries of the world show that historical and cultural objects can be a decisive factor for the development of a tourist complex.
 Properly covered, it will withstand a great deal of adverse conditions.
 Germany, Great Britain, France, Italy and many other countries receive great incomes in this sphere.
There are 24,102 historical and cultural monuments in the territory of the Republic of Armenia [3].
  It should be noted that a small part of them is used as a tourist resource.
  In the current context of tourism development, it is possible to assess the resources of the less known regions in terms of tourism in Armenia, which will allow to stimulate the economic development of those regions.
The aim of the presented article is to study և to reveal the recreational possibilities of Shirakamut concavity spreading in the extreme west of Lori marz of RA.
 The geographical analysis carried out for this purpose allows us to say that the recreational potential of the area is the natural conditions, which stand out with great diversity.
The economic-geographical position is also favorable for the concavity of Shirakamut.
 The Yerevan-Yerevan railway passes almost through the center of the concave, which has stations in Lusaghbyur, Hartagyugh և Shirakamut settlements.
 The central location of the railway in the study area is favorable for passenger transportation, especially for tourists.
  The longest distance of the settlements of the area from the railway station is only 7 km.
The groove has a well-developed road network.
 Almost in its center, parallel to the railway, the Gyumri-Vanadzor highway of national significance passes, to which all the settlements are connected.
  Moreover, their maximum distance from the highway does not exceed 6 km (Tsaghkaber).
In the Shirakamut concave, tourist routes can be operated in both transit and roundabouts.
 Moreover, they can be implemented with both Gyumri and Vanadzor regional routes.
From a physico-geographical point of view, the Shirakamut concave is a graben-synclineal depression, the height of which is 1700-1800 m above sea level [1].
 The concave floor is flat, consisting mainly of sedimentary rocks.
 In the geological past, the Shirakamut plain was the bottom of the lake.
The concavity borders the Pambak mountain range from the south.
 It starts from Jajur mountain pass and spreads to the east.
 The Pambak Range in this section is composed of volcanic-sedimentary rocks.
It has steep slopes.
The concave is bordered on the north by the Shirak mountain range, which is separated from the Bazum mountains by the Chichkhan valley.
 The sloping slopes of the mountain range are steep, fragmented, which makes it difficult to move in this section.

In addition to the variety of natural conditions, there are many historical and cultural monuments in the settlements located in the Shirakamut depression and in the adjacent areas.
 They are little known not only to tourism companies, but also to the public.
 The tourist assessment of the historical and cultural monuments in the Shirakamut concave is one of the main goals of this article.
Description of the methodology.
  Historical and cultural monuments in the territory of the Republic of Armenia are unevenly distributed, but their number still can not give an idea of ​​the cognitive value of the monument - its attractiveness.
 There may be one circumstance. How suitable is the monument for tourist use? It is possible to include it in tourist routes.
Taking into account the above, we considered it necessary to carry out an assessment of the PM monument according to certain features and factors.
 In this respect they become more powerful.1. Distance of the PM monument from the main highways, quality of roads և accessibility, 2. The state of preservation of the PM monument և age, 3. Existence of tourism infrastructure.
Scales have been developed for the evaluation of the mentioned indicators, where both points and coefficients have been given according to expediency.
In total, we have examined 36 historical and cultural monuments located in 8 communities, which are registered in the list of monuments protected by the Government of the Republic of Armenia [4].
Table 1 presents the so-called accessibility factor, which is based on the quality characteristics of the roads.
As the quality of the road network is directly related to the comfortable transportation of tourists and their safety, we considered it expedient to use a coefficient that can reduce or increase the total, total tourist value of the PM monument.
Table 2 presents the classification of PM monuments առ the availability of tourism infrastructure.
 It is more expedient to evaluate these indicators with points.
  Qualitative features were put in the basis of the assessment.
We assessed the state of preservation of the monuments on three quality levels: poorly preserved, medium preservation, well-preserved.
 Based on field studies, it can be said that the monuments of the new և modern regions are relatively well preserved.
 As a rule, medieval և ancient monuments are worse preserved, չունեն they have no attractive value.
        Given this circumstance, a coefficient (K) was used to assess the preservation of the PM monument.
 Moreover, this coefficient was used only with the mark of assessment of the antiquity of the monument (see formula 1).

We also used the existence of tourism infrastructure, which was assessed on a point scale.
The results of the assessment presented in Table 3 will be calculated by the following formula: where: R - PM is the tourist value of the monument A - Scale of antiquity of the monument K - Coefficient of preservation of the monument B - Score of the assessment of tourism infrastructure K1 - Score of accessibility

In case of maximum evaluation points, the tourist value of the PM monument can reach 1.5.
 In the evaluation table, the sums of ebals were made by communities, which allows them to be compared with each other.
The table also shows the total value of the PM monuments of all the settlements of Shirakamut concavity, which will make it possible to make the same index comparable with other regions.
Conclusions.
 The conducted researches allow the following conclusions.1. There are a considerable number of monuments in the Shirakamut concave, which are little known and are almost never used for tourism purposes.
2. As a result of the assessment of the tourist value, the average indicators were obtained, which testifies to the weak development of the tourist complex.
3. The main reason for the low scores of the tourism monument is not so much the scarcity of the monuments, but the poor condition of the monuments, the low attractive value, the complete lack of tourism infrastructure.
4. The results of the tourism evaluation of PA monuments may change over time, as the factors with which the evaluation resulted in lower than average scores due to low scores or coefficients change along with economic development.
