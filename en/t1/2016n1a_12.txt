Introduction.
  The results of work done in many countries around the world show that historical and cultural sitescan be a decisive factor in the development of the tourist complexfor.
 Properly covered, it will withstand a great deal of adverse conditions.
 Germany, Great Britain, France, Italy and many other countries receive great incomes in this sphere.
There are 24,102 historical and cultural monuments in the territory of the Republic of Armenia [3].
  It should be noted that as a tourist resourcea small part of them is used.
  Current development of tourismAssessing the resources of less known regions in terms of tourism in Armenia, which will allowto stimulate the economic development of those regions.
The aim of the presented article is to study և to reveal the recreational possibilities of Shirakamut concavity spreading in the extreme west of Lori marz of RA.
 The geographical analysis carried out for this purpose allows us to say that the recreational potential of the area is the natural conditions, which stand out with great diversity.
The economic-geographical position is also favorable for the concavity of Shirakamut.
 The Yerevan-Yerevan railway passes almost through the center of the concave, which has stations in Lusaghbyur, Hartagyugh և Shirakamut settlements.
 Central location of the railway under studyIt is favorable for passenger transportation in the area, especially for tourists.
  The longest distance to the settlements in the areaIt is only 7 km from the railway station.
The groove has a well-developed road network.
 Almost in its center, parallel to the railway, the Gyumri-Vanadzor highway of national significance passes, to which all the settlements are connected.
  Moreover, their maximum distance from the highway does not exceed 6 km (Tsaghkaber).
In the Shirakamut concave, tourist routes can be operated in both transit and roundabouts.
 Moreover, they can be implemented in both Gyumri and Vanadzorwith tourist routes.
Physical-geographical depression of Shirakamutis a graben-synclinal depression, which is above sea levelIt is 1700-1800 m [1].
 The concave floor is flat, consisting mainly of sedimentary rocks.
 In the geological past, the Shirakamut plain was the bottom of the lake.
The concavity borders the Pambak mountain range from the south.
 It:It starts from Jajur mountain pass and spreads to the east.
 The Pambak Range in this section is composed of volcanic-sedimentary rocks.
It has steep slopes.
The concavity borders the Shirak mountain range from the northIt is separated from Bazum mountains by Chichkhan valley.
 The sloping slopes of the ridge are steep, fragmented, making it difficultpedestrian movement in this section.

In addition to the variety of natural conditions, in the settlements located in the Shirakamut concave, in the adjacent areasThere are many historical and cultural monuments.
 Not only are they little knownto travel companies, but also to the public.
 Tourist of historical and cultural monuments in the concave of ShirakamutEvaluation is one of the main purposes of this article.
Description of the methodology.
  Historical and cultural in the territory of the Republic of Armenia(PM) monuments are unevenly distributed, but their number can not yet give an idea of ​​the cognitive value of the monumentմասին about attractiveness.
 There may be one circumstance. how useful is PM?
monument for tourist use և possible its inclusion in tourist routes.
Taking into account the above, we considered it necessary to carry out an assessment of the PM monument according to certain features and factors.
 In this respect they become more powerful.1. Distance of the PM monument from the main highways, quality of roads և accessibility,2. Preservation status of the monument Պ age,3. Existence of tourism infrastructure.
Scales have been developed for the evaluation of the mentioned indicators,where both points were awarded as appropriatecoefficients.
In total, we surveyed 8 communities36 historical and cultural monuments, which are registered in the list of monuments protected by the Government of the Republic of Armenia [4].
Table 1 presents the so-called accessibility factor, which is based on the quality characteristics of the roads.
Because the quality of the road network is directly related to the convenient transportation of tourists and their safety by usIt is advisable to use a coefficient that can reduceor add general, monetary tourism to the PM monumentvalue.
Table 2 presents the classification of PM monumentsScale առ Existence of tourism infrastructure.
 It is more expedient to evaluate these indicators with points.
  Evaluation:Qualitative features are at the core.
The state of preservation of the monuments has been assessed by usthree qualitative degrees: poorly preserved, medium preservationև Well preserved.
 Based on field studies can:to say that they are relatively well preserved in the new, modern regionsthe monuments.
 As a rule, the monuments of the medieval և ancient periodare worse preserved և they have no Attractive value.
        Given this circumstance, the protection of the PM monumentA coefficient (K) was used for the evaluation.
 Moreover, this coefficient was used only with the mark of assessment of the antiquity of the monument (see formula 1).

Only in the settlements of Shirakamut concaveIt is clear from the presented formula that the final point value is obtained after applying the coefficient of availability.
In case of maximum evaluation points, the tourist value of the PM monument can reach 1.5.
 Done in the evaluation tablesum of points by communities, which allows them to be comparedtogether.
The table also shows the total value of the monuments of all the settlements of Shirakamut concavity, which is an opportunity.will make the same indicator comparable with other regions.
Conclusions.
 The research done allowsmake the following conclusions.1. There are a significant number of PM monuments in the Shirakamut concave,which are little known և are almost never used for tourism purposes.
2. As a result of the assessment of the tourist value, they are obtained from the averagelow indicators, which testifies to the weak development of the tourist complex.
3. Occurrence of low scores in the tourism rating of the PM monumentThe main reason is the lack of PM monuments,as much as the poor condition of the monuments, the attractive low cost և the complete lack of tourist infrastructure.
4. The results of tourism evaluation of PM monuments over timeThey can be changed during the year, because along with economic development, the same factors changeDue to low scores or coefficients, lower than average scores were obtained.
