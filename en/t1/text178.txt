The symbiotic fixation of atmospheric nitrogen by the unique interaction of palaeobacteria and butterfly plants continues to be the focus of many researchers.
 Along with large-scale physiological-biochemical work, using modern methods, special attention is paid to the explanation of the mechanism of this problem, as well as molecular-genetic views.
 The phenomenon of tuberculosis adhesion is mainly studied in order to characterize their unique interaction with plant-plants, species specificity and virulence, as well as the selection of strains.
 Specific strains of tuberculosis bacteria are better adsorbed to the root surface of their host plants than non-specific strains.
  Adhesion of tuberculosis bacteria to cereal roots depends on strain characteristics, crop type and variety [1].
  The primary problem to be solved is the identification of the bacterium and the plant surface components that determine the stickiness, which will lead to the formation of the desired associations of bacteria and plant. Many materials are used to obtain various biofertilizers: molasses, bentonite, peat, zeolite, etc. which increase their stickiness.
  Due to their adhesion properties, microorganisms adapt more easily to the environment, surviving in different ecotypes and in unfavorable conditions [5,6].
  However, some substances have a negative impact on the environment and increase the cost of fertilizer, so it is advisable to select species and strains of 288 palaeobacteria that have high virulence, activity, efficiency and high adhesion properties.
 Adhesion of microorganisms is due to the growth stages of cells.
  Adhesion occurs in the middle stage of the development of larger cells, during which the formations formed on their surface (protrusions, whips) change both quantitatively and qualitatively, due to which they cling to the adsorbent with their limbs.
  Also important factors are the composition of the environment, pH, temperature, hydrophobic and hydrophilic conditions of the bacteria [7].
 The aim of the present work is to select strains with higher adhesion properties from a collection of different types of palaeobacteria stored in the laboratory of nitrogen-fixing bacteria for use in soil nitrogen-enriching biofertilizers.
 Materials and methods.
  30 strains of lentils, peas, carobs and peas isolated from different zones of Armenia were examined.
 The pattern of adsorption of microorganisms is initially convenient to study on transparent adsorbents - glass, modified glass surfaces, which allows modeling to be performed, facilitating further work when working with more complex, unique adsorbents.
 Adhesion of palaeobacteria has been studied on the surfaces of ordinary and quartz glass, as well as the roots of butterflies.
  The methods of rinsing in water and acting with centrifugal force were used.
  Adhesion is characterized by the number of adhesions (Ύ F) equal to the number of cells (N) left on the adsorbent after a given shear force is compared to their original number (N 0).
  For the experiment, lentils, peas, carobs and peas 2 cm long and thick, with equal root sprouts were used, which were immersed in suspensions of palabacteria, then desorption of palabacteria was performed by CVR-1 centrifuge.
  The number of adsorbed cells was determined by the methods of gradual dilution in crushed root suspension and direct counting under a light microscope.
 Adhesion of palaeobacteria was determined by 3 characteristic criteria: • 24, 48, 72-hour growth of microorganisms • Dynamics of their contact with adsorbent for 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120 minutes • Different amounts of centrifugal force: 9000g, 14000g and All The experiments were performed 5-6 times and more, each value was studied with 3-4 repetitions.
 տոկոս F = 289 The nitrogen fixation activity of tuberculosis bacteria was determined in samples of butterfly plants and their tubers grown in laboratory, vegetation and field experiments.
 Results and discussion.
  Adhesion of 26 strains of peas, lentils and carnations was studied by rinsing the surface of ordinary glass with water.
 Regardless of species and nitrogen fixation activity, all strains were adsorbed to some extent on the glass surface (Table 1).
  The pea tuberculosis bacteria were more intensively adsorbed. The number of cells adsorbed on 1 cm 2 surface was 0.162.6 million.
  In the case of carnation and lentil tuberculosis, 0.6-1.9 and 0.45-1.8 million cells, respectively.
 The adhesion of two strains of lentil palabacteria was determined by applying a centrifugal force to the glass surface at different stages of cell growth (Table 2).

 For example, in strain 6009 it is 1.15 million, in strain 6020 it is 0.94 million.
  The magnitude of the adhesion can not yet be judged by the sheer number of cells left on the surface, that is, firmly adsorbed on the surface after exposure to any method.
  More accurate data on the tight bond between cells and surfaces are given by the value Ύ F, ie the adhesion number.
  The adhesion number of lentil strain 6020 is equal to 52.2%, for strain 6009 - 50.0%.
 The adhesion strength that keeps lentil palabacteria on quartz glass 290, as shown in the table, has a strain characteristic.
  The number of cells of glass adsorbed strain 6020 is less than that of strain 6009, and the number of adhesions is higher.

  Using different magnitudes of centrifugal force, the adsorption of pea strain 5609 and carob strain 5881 on the root surfaces of host plants under 24, 48, 72-hour cell growth conditions (Table 3) was studied.
 Experiments show that the number of cells adhering to the surface ((F) also changes with the duration of growth of tuberculosis bacteria.
  The highest adhesion is observed during the 48-hour growth of microorganisms, which is 56.0 in pea strain 5609 and 54.1% in 5881 pea strain.
 To determine the adhesion strength of the cells and the amount of force acting on the contact surface, the adhesion of pea strain 5609 to the adsorbent under contact with the adsorbent for 5, 10, 20, 20, 30, 60, 120 minutes and the force acting on 9000g, 14000g and 20,000g was studied.
  It was found that in case of 30 minutes of contact with the adsorbent and 9000g of applied centrifugal force, the adhesion number of the studied strain is the highest - 53.0%.
 Then the adhesion of 14 strains of peas, peas, carobs and lentils to the root surfaces was studied under the conditions already known to us, ie 48-hour growth of tuberculosis bacteria, 30 minutes of contact with the adsorbent and 9000 g of effective force (Table 4).

  The adhesion rate of lentil palabacteria is 44.1-50.0%, and pea palabacteria are slightly lower than the previous ones - 36.0 - 37.1%.
 292 Discussing the obtained data, it can be noted that the growth phases of microorganisms, which in our experiments are the exponential phase (48 hours), the duration of cell contact with the adsorbent is 30 minutes, and the centrifugal force is 9000, which are important characteristics for the degree of adhesion of palaeobacteria.
  The force that keeps cells on the surface of plant roots also depends on the type of tuberculosis that has been studied.
  As already mentioned in salt 3, in pea and carob bacteria it is bigger than lentils and peas.
 There is also a strain feature, which is mentioned in salt.2.
 Experiments show that the adhesion capacity of tuberculosis bacteria is not correlated with their nitrogen fixation activity.
  There are similar data in the works of other authors, which show that the ability of alfalfa and pea palabacteria to be adsorbed on the roots of host plants is not related to their virulence [1, 9].
 As a result of the work done, strains of peas and carnation with high adhesion capacity were selected, which were used in the preparation of "Nitragin" bio-fertilizer that accumulates nitrogen in the soil.
  Experiments in different climatic conditions of Armenia have shown that the bio-fertilizer "Nitragin" used by us provides active symbiosis with butterfly-flowering plants, improves plant growth, resistance, increases the amount of nitrogen in the grain and green mass [10].
