The main goal of the reforms in the field of science and education is to create a knowledge-based economy and society.
  The state has a decisive role in that process.
  The field of science is important in the Republic of Armenia as an exceptional factor in the development of education, economy, culture and society, ensuring the security of the country.
  Among the problems of education management in the field of science are the development of scientific and technical potential, encouragement of investment in the economy of science and technology achievements, integration of science, education and production, promotion of the development of Armenology, etc.
  A number of changes have been made in Armenia to solve the above-mentioned problems of science development.
  But the management of the sphere has shortcomings that must be solved first.
  In this context, we offer several ways.
 1. Ensuring the growth of the number of highly qualified young personnel in the field of science, education and technology, as well as modernization of the infrastructure and material-technical base of the field of science.
 According to the results published by the HRC, in 2010-2016, 3348 people received scientific degree certificates in the republic, of which 263 were doctors of science and 3085 were candidates of science, and in 2000-2009, 4567 people received scientific degree certificates in the republic, of which 452 were doctors of science , 4057 Candidate of Science degree.
  The dynamics of statistics show that in the last 6 years the number of people engaged in science has decreased by 12.19% (1219 people).
 HRC- http.
 //boh.am/ 179 ECONOMICS The average age of individuals with a degree is 56 years, the average age of candidates of science is 52 years and that of doctors is 66 years.
  At the same time, the lack of the middle generation is significant: 27-35 year olds make up only 15%, 36-50 year olds 16%, and those over 60 years old 47%.
  It should be noted that young people do not want to do science, and this is due to a number of known shortcomings in the field.
 a) The outflow of highly qualified personnel from the field of science continues, as well as the lack of a state target policy and relevant strategy for the recruitment and approval of young personnel from the country.
 b) The material base and infrastructure do not meet the requirements of modern science.
 c) The scientific information base of the research is incomplete, the network of electronic libraries is missing.
  Scientific publishing activity does not meet international standards.
  In addition to the above, it is necessary to draw attention to the solution of the following issues.
 Արար Insufficient level of state funding for science  Low level of participation of the private sector in the financing of science  Non-compliance of the management system of science and technology with modern standards  Insufficient number of highly qualified staff in some fields of science բարձր High age staff of researchersLack of an effective system of training and retraining of scientific staff ռազմ Lack of strategic plans for the development of most scientific organizations  Non-compliance of most scientific infrastructure products with modern standards 180 ECONOMICS   Insufficient level of coordination of interdisciplinary research  The results of the study of the international experience of scientists as well as postgraduate students 2 show that we see the solution of the existing problems and the involvement of young staff in the field of science in the implementation of the following measures.We see the solution of the existing problems and the involvement of young staff in the field of science in the Republic of Armenia in the implementation of the following measures.We see the solution of the existing problems and the involvement of young staff in the field of science in the Republic of Armenia in the implementation of the following measures.
 a) Develop and introduce an innovative mechanism for training scientific staff.
  Application of new methods of training personnel with scientific and highly professional qualifications.
 To compile a concept of the peculiarities of the RA economy, which will be aimed at the substantive reforms of the postgraduate education and the increase of the scientific level of the dissertations.
  It is necessary to pass to modern European scientific, educational and postgraduate standards.
 In particular, apply new distance learning methods, new learning programs and e-learning tools.
 b) Create an environment in which young people will be involved.
  To support young scientists with grant programs, to encourage young people to enter science.
  Career enhancement is very important for young people, so it is necessary to develop and introduce incentives for highly efficient researchers, improve the working and social conditions of researchers, as well as high pensions in case of retirement.
 Today the investigator's 181 ECONOMICS or judge's pension is about ten times higher than the professor's pension, which is unacceptable.
 c) Increasing the efficiency of reproduction of scientific potential, ensuring the strengthening of young staff in the field of science.
  The issue of effective reproduction of scientific personnel and ensuring a smooth generation change is of fundamental importance for the progressive development of the field of science in the Republic of Armenia.
 The research base of the research in Armenia is incomplete, there is no network of electronic educational databases and libraries, university institutions.
  Scientific publishing activity does not meet international standards.
  It is almost impossible to publish a young scientist's monograph or participate in international conferences.
 The results of the study show that the number of scientific publications in previous years was: 1) according to the passport data of state scientific organizations and universities, in 2011-2014 an average of 4,464 scientific articles were published annually, 3 of the main results of dissertations as well as 332 books and monographs acceptable for the publication of articles in scientific journals.
  These indicators in 2011 were 4,362 and 273, and in 2014 - 4,619 and 437.
  The analysis shows that the number of scientific articles has increased by about 6%, and the number of books and monographs - by 60%. 2) According to SJRSCImago Journal & Country Rank 4, as of July 30, 2016, according to the SJRSC-Simago Journal and Country Rank 4 website, 5 201, which is an increase of 56% compared to the previous five years: 182 ECONOMICS In 2006-2010, 3,323 were published.
  Such an increase is about 1.75 times more than the increase in the number of total publications in 231 countries included in the Scopus database for 2011-2015 compared to 2006-2010, which is about 32%.
  The number of scientific works in Armenia in 2013-2015 was 1,034, 1,066 and 953, respectively.
  The above indicators show that the potential of human capital in Armenia is quite high, but it is not effectively managed in the field of science.
 In 2011-2015, the share of scientific works co-authored by Armenian researchers within the framework of international cooperation also increased: the annual average value was 57.5% in 2011-2015, and 54.0% in 2006-2010.
  That index in 2013-2015 was 56.4, 58.4 and 63.0, respectively.
 2) The number of scientific papers (documents) published by Armenian research organizations and universities in 2006-2015 and the share of those published within the framework of international cooperation according to the SJR-SCImago Journal & Country Rank (July 30, 2016) as of).
 3) According to the Web of Science database of InCites, the number of scientific articles published by the research organizations and universities of the Republic of Armenia and included in the Web of Science in 2011-2015 was 3,827. , and in 2006-2010 - 2 549, the growth was about 50 percent (according to the data of August 8, 2016).
  The number of scientific articles in 2011-2015 was 713, 837, 744, 727 and 806, respectively.
 The following is a table of the results of the research conducted on the basis of the 2014-2015-2016 report on the governance mechanism of higher education institutions in the Republic of Armenia, which confirms the existence of the above-mentioned problems and the need for their solution.
