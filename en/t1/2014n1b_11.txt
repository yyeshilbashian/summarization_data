The uniqueness of the English-Armenian lullabies as original texts of rhetoric is dictated by the fact that the addressee is the child, his world, and the author is the people-parent, mostly women who take care of the child.
 The language of the lullaby text stands out with its emotion and variety of expressive palette.
  Mother (cradle) և child, child և love, praise and admonition, longing and exhortation, texts including blessing and wish. These are the content layers in which the features of the cradle's art are manifested.
 In the texts of the cradles, the supernatural environment is formed, the characters of which are magical, supernatural.
 The mother is sincere in what she says, she does not hide her feelings, admiration and disappointment from everyday life.
In different historical and cultural contexts, the main function of the cradle is to ensure the baby's sleep, which is carried out by supernatural, gifted or sleepy characters.
  As we have already mentioned, the connection of the child որ mother is mainly expressed in the cradles, the role of the female sex becomes natural.
  The narrator factor is used in the text, as it is able to influence the listener (in the case of cradles, the child).
 Both the child and the cradle are viewed as active participants in the cradle text.
 The songs that ensure the sleep of the child emphasize the mother-child relationship.
  In every human life, mothers are the first storytellers, sometimes the storytellers.
  In the fairy tale, the child is safer, because for the most part he grows up in a fertile and patronizing atmosphere of supernatural devotional spirits.
 Sometimes these spirits can get other names: guardian spirit, child-guarding spirit, guardian spirit.
Often, on the basis of traditional cradles, the mother creates spontaneous, impromptu texts corresponding to her present moment, especially when she has a very intense feeling.
 The child seems to be the cherished person to whom the mother communicates the problem that concerns her, while telling the text of her life.
 Telling Barur about destiny is an unusual, extraordinary way of communicating, which becomes a unique kind of emotional relief for the mother.
In many cradles, it is clear that the mother uses child-sponsored characters (Holy Mother of God, God, saints, angels) as supernatural forces.
 Let us prove the folklore samples confirming the above.
In the texts of the cradles, the mother sometimes expresses the limitation of her possibilities, therefore she asks the supernatural, supernatural forces to provide welfare, prosperity, and strengthening of the further steps for her child.
 In the content plan of the cradle, he creates an out-of-reality reality with the sub-references of emotions and feelings, using the word units "Heaven" and "garden".
In fact, supernatural characters appear in a supernatural environment, the heroes are in harmony with that environment, and their actions are dictated by that environment.
 The text of the Armenian cradles sounds like a protective child. It is evil, it has a magical power to keep the child from evil eyes and evil thoughts.
²ëïí³Í³Ù³ÛñÝ å³Ñ å³ÑÇ [6, page 55].
The text expresses the idea of ​​prohibition against evil (â³ñË³ ÷ ³Ýã³ñ »ñ¹ Ë³ ÷ ³ÝÇ), at the same time it is a formula of blessing (²ëïí³Í³Ù³ÛñÝ ³ñ¨¹ å³ÑÇ) մամբ stands out with the incomparable manifestation of the element of folk language thinking ã³ñ »ñáõ¹).
Thus, the language of the cradle text expresses formulas (wish, blessing, manifestation of the magical power of speech against evil forces), which are endowed with supernatural possibilities of wish fulfillment.
 The mother who puts the baby to sleep expresses her most sincere feelings, sacred trembling and bright dreams for the child's future in a series of cradles, creating a imaginary, fairy-tale world for her Child.
 The text of the lullaby represents a unique world.
Usually the mother turns to fairy-tale time, trying to cut herself off from the real world and time.
 Moreover, the depicted world is close to the real, but it is imaginary and unreal.
 Of course, that world is strictly conditional. exists "in time", out of time.
There is no limit to existence in fairy-tale time արկ objectification, because time is perceived as an infinite concept.
 In the mentioned context, the child is viewed with a light of infinity, infinity, immortality.
Symbolic characters penetrate the imaginary world created by their mother with their supernatural power.
  Mystical images help to create a world where everything is kind, full of optimism, shrouded in light.
 In a number of cradles, fairy-tale characters from the flora and fauna are clearly depicted.
  A special role is played by animals, which are like sleeping spirits, accompanying the child in the transitional stages of a good life.
 Thus, Oror, oror, came to the deer, came to the deer, came down to the mountains.
Bring a sweet sleep to you too. Bring your sea to fill your eyes, Sweet to make you sleepy, Sweet to satisfy your milk [6, p. 56].
The text itself is melodic, a unique softness, a sweet sleep, sea-sea eyes, with the accents emphasized in the expressions with sweet milk, the soft and calm atmosphere is created, which is so necessary for the child's peaceful sleep.
 In other folklore genres, the function of mother is often attributed to deer or deer.
  We meet the typical expression of this idea in J. Aghayan's "Child of the Forest" fairy tale. Dear child, you have been left an orphan, Your unfortunate mother has been taken prisoner. She is gone, lost, she will not come back, She will never breastfeed you again.
He wrapped you in wide feathers. He tied you in a swing, saying "nanik". He cried with salty tears, His last "nanik" cried. Nana, my baby, nana! Pakhra will come, she will breastfeed, Nana, my lamb, Nana… Here I have come to breastfeed you, To keep, to protect like my calf, Pakhra breastfed the child, the child was satisfied and slept [5, pp. 383-384]… As we see , the penetration of the genre (the cradle in the fairy tale) has further enriched the content of the cradle.
From the point of view of the problem that concerns us, the idea of ​​protection from the danger of fairies in English folklore is remarkable.
The fairies, as supernatural characters or spirits, appeared to be poisonous creatures stealing children.
  The idea that in Scotland (և not only) fairies stole a child from the cradle փոխարեն put another child in its place (fairychangeling) is now unbelievable in our time.
  This same idea is confirmed by the following example. Fairy steals childfrom cradle and leaves fairy substitute [8, р. 45].
 Despite all this, other sources confirm that fact.
 Ջ. Մ. Barry gives the fairy version the origin. "When a child laughs for the first time, his laughter breaks into millions of pieces; they spread all over the world, and so the fairies appear" [1, p. 39].
In addition to supernatural characters and supernatural environments, there are also known supernatural objects.
  Thus, in order to get rid of the danger of fairies from the evil eye, in the English reality, other items of a chest-protective nature were attached to the child's clothes, and in Armenian, an eye bead.
The use of a sleeping bead, which is most often found in Armenian folk tales, was considered a supernatural means of sleep. A woman put her eyes on him, put a man on her head and fell asleep.
 He slept for a day, brought a woman to the bedside room, snatched her unsteadily, rolled her stone, brought her a hat, covered her head with a blanket, and put it on the stone [4, p. 349].
  Or Kül, Blbulzknu will be beaten to death, you are my wine, they will be clothed, tied, and they will wear a four-legged robe [4, p. 54].
In the Armenian customary and cultural life, the mother sometimes uses tricks to reprimand and silence the sleepless child. "Sleep, or Meshokpa or Bobo (the name of an imaginary monster that frightens children) will come and take him" [3, p. 381].
  In foreign languages, a child who does not sleep is threatened with the ominous image of an owl. Willie Winkie is referred to in English life as a sleepy omen.
By the way, there are symbolic images that appear in both English and Armenian cradles (միայն not only).
 We think that the latter is conditioned by universal psychological patterns, commonalities of women's thinking and emotional world, regardless of ethnicity.
 The mother's unique appearance towards the child is that the role of the wind interferes with the cradle.
  The wind helps the crib to change, the sleep to get closer to the baby's eyes. In one of the Armenian cribs, the warm southern wind swings the baby, ensures the sleepy state of his sleep.
 The wind, as a natural element and a pre-primordial element (air), again embodies a supernatural image.
The upper sheep will suckle you [6, p. 95].
In all cases, at the linguistic level ("south wind") the phrase in one case, in the other case the definition of "golden slumbers" (golden slumbers) become a revelation of the emotional state of the mother and the cherished desire for the child.
Smiles await you when you rise.
Thus, Plpul made the puppies cry, He brought sleep to win the eyes. He brought sleep, filled his eyes, Anush put him to sleep [6, p. 56].
It is obvious that the images of nature are symbolic in the cradles.
 In the English text, the mockingbird has acquired another functional content, that is, a sleeping feature.
  We can say that in the lullabies the "inhabitants of nature" appear in the supernatural realm.
  Of course, the word supernatural has unusual, extraordinary, supernatural meanings [7, p. 429].
In spite of all this, it can be said that in the imaginary world she has created, the mother herself takes an image from nature, endowing her with supernatural, unusual, extraordinary qualities (the mention of deer, feather, squirrel, wind in the above-mentioned cribs).
 The meaning and significance of the cradle is that we give the child from the beginning the understanding that he ինքը nature is identified, that is, the child is a part of nature.
 The mother sings these lullabies, with which she seems to entrust her child to the care of mother nature, trying to ensure the connection between her and nature, that is, she envelops her child with filial love for nature with pictorial expressions.
 The purpose of the above is to show the unity of child երեխայի nature (child-nature), child երեխայի universe (child-earth).
  In the cradles, the perception and feeling of beauty are presented in the harmonious realm of the whole, the aesthetic function of the child to be like nature.
  The interweaving, combination and harmonization of elements and elements of nature are emphasized by the "English" Armenian lullaby texts.
The description of the other world created by Ororasatsi is characterized by the subtle use of its linguistic means of expression.
 The mother goes through an infinite path of spiritual refinement, choosing this or that linguistic unit, the means of depiction, that suits her mental state.
In general, the boundary between the real and the unreal is blurred, the interweaving of each other is so spontaneous, so direct, that it is difficult to distinguish where the real ends and where the real begins.
Linguistic reality (text of the lullaby) respectively expresses the supernatural, the imaginary, the imaginary, which are always external, out of the everyday dimensions, approaching the exceptional manifestation of the mother's feeling towards the child, in which both earthly and heavenly forces participate.
There are few examples in English-Armenian lullabies when the lullabyist mentions the name of the addressee, as giving the child's name was a secret.
  In the early historical context, the name of a person was not introduced; instead, short expressions were used.
  In the Armenian reality, people substituted the name of a child for my beauty, sweetheart, or gave the names of celestial illuminators - rs, moon, star, my bright star, and sometimes the names of animals - piso jan, pisik jan, dog jan.
 Apparently, this phenomenon can be explained by supernatural relations and pleas.
Our study allows us to conclude that in the texts of the lullabies the means of depiction are mostly used, which in fact become the means of stylistic expression of the word.
 In all cases, the relation to the supernatural is created by the magic of words, with the tendency to go beyond the ordinary meaning of the word հաս to achieve the unusual.
Another telling example is: At the linguistic level, the comparison of Sleep like a lady (or gentleman) as a means of depiction-expression, to some extent, is related to exaggeration.
 The latter is the highest grade given by the mother to the child.
 In Armenian cradles և he cries words of praise to his child, which also creates a supernatural environment, because in the cradle "a sleeping child cannot be a king". Nana, my dear king, Golden trembling dear, Nana, nand you sacrifice, Nana herd you smell [2 , page 56].
In our view, the repetitive units of crib texts (same beginning, same end), as well as the regular changing of the crib, ultimately serve the process of ensuring the child's sleep, creating the illusion of a supernatural environment.
 The coherence of words and actions accelerates the realization of the goal of the cradle.
