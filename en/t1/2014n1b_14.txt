The natural boundaries of Mahal crossed the Yernjak River in the east, the Vayots Dzor mountain range in the north, the Arpa River in the west, and the Araks River in the south.
 It bordered on the east of Azat-Tsiran, on the north by Daralagyaz, and on the west by Yerevan.
XVII-XVIII centuries There were 33-80 settlements in Darashamb's mahal.
Mahal suffered in 1605. From the deportation organized by Shah Abbas I (1587-1629), dozens of settlements were destroyed, but a few decades later a small part of the Armenian population returned and settled in their native villages.
City of Nakhichevan.
 The city of Nakhichevan was the capital and administrative center of the region of the same name, the governing seat of Tuman-e Nakhichevan.
  The city is located 8.5 km northwest of the Araks River, on the right bank of the Nakhichevan River, at the foot of Mount Gharachugh.
 The city has played a great role in the political, economic, administrative, social and cultural life of the Armenian people since ancient times.
The Armenian legend connects the place name Nakhichevan with the first place where the ancestor Noah landed.
 The oldest information about this legend can be found in the first century Jewish historian Josephus Plavios. "Nokos (ancestor Noah, H. P.), leaving his family, offered sacrifices to God and had a feast with his family members.
 The Armenians still call that place a place to go down ”[12, p. 54].
 This legend was reflected in medieval Armenian and foreign authors.
  Thus, Ghazar Jahketsi writes: "The same legend is told by the European traveler, missionary Nalian, who built the world in 1539 AD." "After the flood, the former city of Nakhchivan was Armenian, because the former descendants of Noah's sons or the former descendants of Noah, because they did not go there with the rest of the world, were told to be in Noah's tomb."
  The toponym Nakhichevan is differently interpreted by the Jesuit preacher Willod, who, according to Noah, measured this area by name and built a city, which is why it was called Nakhchuan [2, pp. 496-497].
In our bibliography V-XIII centuries. The place name Nakhichevan is often found with the names Nakhchavan, Nakhchuan, Nakhchivan.
 The etymology of the mentioned place names was not referred to in Armenology.
 Only the German Armenologist Hübschmann made a pop-up reference to the etymology of the name Nakhchavan from the above-mentioned places. "Nakhich or Nakhuch ytk. a name + avan = a town of a forerunner or a forerunner ... »[13, p. 385].
 In our opinion, the toponym Nakhchavan was one of the most common toponyms in the colloquial Armenian people, such as the names Nakhchuan or Nakhchivan.
 Nakhchavan also meant to descend: First, first, settlement, settlement, so for us all the names are acceptable and familiar.
 The place-name Nakhichevan had different names among foreign peoples: the Greeks called it Nakhsuana, the Arabs - Neshi, Neshu, the Persians - Nakhua, Nakhchivan, Nashua, Nagshijahan, the Turks called it Nagshijahan [2, p. 497].
Julfa.
  Julfa, one of the oldest settlements in Armenia, had 2,000 households or 10,000 Armenians at the beginning of the 17th century [25, p. 74].
 During the deportation of Shah Abbas I in 1605, it was completely destroyed and the population was deported to Persia.
  According to Chardin, a French traveler who visited Julfa on April 13, 1673, 68 years after these events, the city had 30 families, all of them Armenians [26, p. 303].
 The place name Jugha is mentioned in Armenian historiography as Jugha, Tsogha, Jugha, and from the beginning of the XVII century Old Jugha (for distinguishing it from New Julfa founded in Isfahan).
  Foreign historians and travelers called it page 410].
The people of Jugha used to check the name of their place of residence in the following way. Ani began to be destroyed, and Julfa flourished, which was considered its mimas or branch, that is, branch-a Jugha [23, p. 173].
 Of course, this does not correspond to the reality, as the name Jugha is first mentioned by the historian Movses Khorenatsi in the 5th century. [22, pp. 84-85].
 According to Ghazar Chahketsi, after the destruction of the city of Ani, "half of the population went to Jugha ..." [16, p. 633].
  Most probably, after the fall of Ani, a part of its population settled in Julfa, playing a huge role in the XV-XVII centuries. In economic and cultural life, especially this period coincided with the period of the fall of Ani and the development of Julfa.
  On this occasion in Leongr. "A number of side circumstances speak in favor of this tradition.
  First of all, the people of Jugha formed a completely separate ethnographic group with their own dialect.
  Not to mention the fact that Jugha did not bring its commercial fame from ancient times, but only after the final destruction of Ani became uninhabited (XIII-XIV centuries).
 Finally, one thing that gives the people of Jugha the right to be considered the heirs of Anetsi is his art, which again gives him an island-like image in the Araks gorge.
 The monuments of that art are the khachkars of Jugha, which represent a bottomless luxury of ornament.
  Such a delicate artistic taste, such flights of creative imagination could have emerged as a development of the art whose classical homeland was Shirak ”[8, pp. 236-237].
The city of Jugha was located on the left bank of the Araks River, more than 2 km long, from east to west, from Araks to the nearby mountains, 400500 m wide.
  The districts of Jugha, founded between the mountain ranges, also included the coastal plains of the Araks, where the ruins and traces of urban buildings such as a bridge, a caravanserai, the church of Andreordi, a cemetery and other structures could be seen.
 The left bank of the Araks River, where Jugha was founded, is a rather deep and long, narrow gorge, which the people of Jugha called Tsakuta gorge, Tsakut.
  The Magharda Range bends south to the east of Jugha, and the Jugha Range, called Tapi Mountain, Hazaran, Dzorut Mountains, extends northward to the upper reaches of the Yernjak River.
 Due to this position, a small plain with small hills and mounds appeared in Tsakuta gorge, where Jugha was spread [3, pp. 5-6].
 The ancient information about Julfa belongs to Movses Khorenatsi. "... zeris avans Khram և zughay ևz Khoshakunis ..." [22, p. 177].
 Among the medieval architectural monuments of Julfa were the Amenaprkich Monastery, St. Astvatsatsin, St. Gorg, St. Minas, St. Hovhannes, St. Hakob, the Holy Trinity or Verin Katan, Andreord, Pomblos Hour Churches, the city cemetery, which was built in 1648. According to the data, it had 10 thousand well-preserved khachkars, in 1903-1904 - 5 thousand, in 1929 - 3 thousand, and in 1973 - 2707 [3, pages 24, 34].
 In December 2005, with the permission of the Azerbaijani authorities, the last khachkars of Julfa were barbarically destroyed.
The famous city of Jugha, a famous city in the Nakhichevan region, played a huge role in the economic and cultural life of medieval Armenia, gaining great fame not only in our homeland, but also abroad, from India to Europe, but, unfortunately, in 1605. Due to the deportation organized by Shah Abbas I, the developing economic and cultural life of the "God-fearing village" was disrupted and never restored.
We will start the description of the mahalla villages of Darashamb from the east, from the settlements that are located on the right bank of the Yernjak River, gradually moving to the north-west.
  On the right bank of the Yernjak River, at a distance of 500 meters, is the village of Aprakunik or Aprakunis [14, pp. 35-36].
 We meet the earliest mention of the settlement in 1379. handwritten manuscript. "... No. PI (1379) was written, "Igeoghs Aprakuneats, on the door of St. Sargis, in the days of the hermit Malakia ..." [6, p. 532].
  The two greatest thinkers of medieval Armenia, Hovhan Vorotnetsi and Grigor Tatatsi, taught at the school of Aprakunyats Monastery.
  1379 Hovhan Vorotnetsi transferred to the University of Aprakunyats Monastery ելուց After teaching for two years, he settled in Tat, entrusting his genius student Grigor Tatatsi with the teaching of the school of the Aprakunyats Monastery.
 The purpose of the temporary settlement in Nakhichevan was to fight against the Catholic propaganda.
 1 km north-east of Aprakunis, on the shore of the Yernjak River, was the village of Aparanner.
  XVII century At the beginning of the 19th century, the residence of the leader-bishop of the Armenian Catholics was moved here from the city of Nakhichevan.
 The Catholic Armenian population of Aparan became Muslim in the mid-18th century, and the settlement was renamed Bananear [14, pp. 80-81].
Kuznut և Arazinyughs were located 4 km south-west of Aparan [24, p. 152].
The village of Saltagh was located 500 m north of the village of Aparaner.
 This settlement was built in the XV-XVI centuries. Aparan was a district of the village, it was built on the slabs of the foot of Mount Odzasar, hence its name Sal-i-district, the inhabitants of the latter were Catholic Armenians, who later converted to Islam [14, pp. 67-71].
  The villages of Jamaldin and Kizilja were located on the left bank of the Yernjak River, and the villages of Aravsyak were upstream [24, pp. 153-158].
The villages of Norashen and Gyaljarajur are located on the north-western slope of Mount Odzasar, in the middle course of the Yernjak River. The ruins of the latter, still visible in the 19th century, prove that it dates back to the 17th-18th centuries. It had a population of 700 parishes [24, pp. 156-157].
  Part of the population of Norashen was Catholic Armenian, the other part was Apostolic.
  Archimandrite Aristakes Sedrakian mentions that the name Norashen indicates that it is a newly established settlement, but his observation is incorrect, as the settlement is first mentioned in 1665. in the manuscript memoir. "... from the land of Yernjakay, from the village, to say Norashen ..." [20].
  He erred in thinking that Norashen was the village of Shahbunis mentioned by Jahketsi [14, pp. 82-83].
 However, Shahbunis was located in the upper reaches of the Nakhichevan River, on its right bank.
Khoshkashengyugh was located at the northwestern foot of Mount Odzasar, where the majority of the population was Armenian Catholic.
 XVIII century In the middle of the 19th century, a part of the Armenian population of the village converted to Islam, the other part emigrated to Izmir and Europe [2, p. 367].
 We meet the ancient mention of the settlement with Movses Khorenatsi. "... the zero advance of Khram ևzՋugha և Khoshakunis ..." [22, p. 85].
 The village of Shahkert (Ghazanchi *) was located on the right bank of the Yernjak River, at the foot of the Meghratsor Vemlera.
  His name was under the control of the Shah's disciple, it was probably declared Khas և he paid the taxes directly to the Shah's court.
 XVIII century In the middle, the people of Shahkert migrated to Shushi, where they founded the Ghazanchetsots district and the Church of the Holy Savior (Ghazanchetsots) [2, p. 362].
Now we will present the settlements located along the Nakhichevan River basin.
  12 km south of the city of Nakhichevan, on the left bank of the Nakhichevan River, was one of the most famous settlements of the region, Astapat [7, p. 46].
 The following legend about the name Astapat existed among the Armenians of Nakhichevan in 451. After the battle of Avarayr, the Armenian commander Vardan Mamikonyan և brought the bodies of the soldiers who had died with him to the people 'in the monastery of this settlement (later called St. Vardan) Ast epatel (in the wall) [4, p. 59].
 Astapat is first mentioned in written sources near Tovma Artsruni, when locating the village of Khram: "... in the name of Khrami, which is under the monastery of Astapat ..." [5, p. 179].
  During the deportation of Shah Abbas I in 1605, his entire population moved to Persia.
 Later a part of the population managed to return to their native settlement.
 1736 Catholicos Abraham of Crete comes to Astapat and describes the deplorable condition of the village. "And then I went down to the blessed village of Astapat ... գ although at least but deserted, uninhabited, uninhabited, that some poor people were found ..." [1, p. 78].
 XIX century At the beginning of the 19th century, Abbas Mirza, the heir to the throne of Persia, deported the population of Astapat and moved it from the village, 3 km north of the newly founded village of Tazakeand (Tazagyugh HP).

 4 km west of the city of Nakhichevan, on the right bank of the Nakhichevan River, was the village of Tambat [2, p. 504] (later Tmbul settlement H. P.).
 The earliest evidence of the settlement is found in Movses Khorenatsi. "... up to the border of Goghtan, which are Tambat ..." [22, p. 85].

 The village of Bulgan was located 1 km south of Yamkhan [25, p. 133].
 Yarmjagyugh was located 3 km north-west of the city of Nakhichevan.

 The village of Jahuk was located 3 km north of Shmrtam, on the bank of Chahuk river.
  It is mentioned in the sources since 1640. "... in the year ROH we started to build the church of Chahka, which St. John, April 5 (5) day of the Lord of the Resurrection ”[10, p. 789].
 The small Muslim villages of Khalili, Uzunoba, Hasan-agha, Kerim-bek-diza, Kuli-bek-diza, Nazarabad were located between the villages of Shmrtan and Jahuk.

To the west of Mahal, on the southern slope of the Vayk mountain range, 35 km north-west of the town of Nakhichevan, was the village of Aznaberd [2, p. 505].
 The settlement dates back to the XIX century. The observed ruins testify that at the end of XVII-XVIII centuries. It had a population of 700 Armenian households [24, pp. 132-133].
 3 km south of Aznaberd was the village of Yaghbin, 2 km east of it was Khartsgyugh [9, pp. 10, 64].

 The village of Nors was located 3 km east of Shahapunik.
The village of Otsop, Atsop (later Badamlu settlement H.P.) was located on the right bank of the Shahapunik river.
  The settlement is first mentioned in 1292. in the memoir of the written manuscript. "... and the letter of God was written in the province of Shahapuniats, in the monastery that is next to the most blessed" God-fearing village called Otsop ... "[21, p. 132].
The village of Kuki was located on the right bank of the Kuki mountain, a tributary of the Nakhichevan River, on the southern slope of the Kuki mountain.
  1471 The memoir of the manuscript testifies: "Among the Armenians, in the 11th year, a book was written in the valley of Shahapuneats in a village called Kuki, under the patronage of St. Hazarbur and St. Katughike. Of the Virgin and St. Stepanos and Geghamisb. Gregory and St. Nshanis and other united Vardanats St. նածակացս ... »[15, p. 148].
  The memoir testifies that Cook in the XV century. It was quite a big city.

 The villages of Krt and Taterk were located a little further away.
 2 km east of these villages, in a rather rocky place, was located the village of Karakap.
Thus, the mahalla settlements of Darashamb in the Nakhichevan region, which were located on the slopes of the mountains, on the banks of rivers, in the plains in the valleys, surviving from the ancient period until the XVII-XVIII centuries, were destroyed, abandoned and deserted.
 Most of the villages of Mahali were urban settlements, ancient Armenian settlements, cultural and literary centers.
 The impetus for the eviction of Armenians from the settlements of Mahal was the policy of persecution of Armenians by Persia, as a result of which in the XVIII century. In the middle of the 19th century, the mass emigration of the Armenian population resumed with a new impetus.
  Many of the settlements of Mahal were destroyed, the rest, deprived of the Armenian population and settled by a small number of Muslim nomads, became desolate, some of the place names were distorted.
