The aim of the work is to show the way passed by only a small group of Armenian writers and intellectuals in the reality of the 30s, to present several literary destinies based on the latest facts.
Ler Kamsar in his diaries (միայն not only), Walter Aramyanir in his book "Kolima", Gurgen Mahari in his letters from exile, in the novel "Flowering barbed wire", Vahram Alazan in his memoir "Suffering Paths" (These names are only in the context of our article).
 Each of them has chosen a unique way to extract the facts. one with a diary և with a laugh, the second with a memoir, and the third with a tearful humor.
 These works could have appeared much earlier, but sometimes times are more than obligatory, it is not man who is the owner of time, on the contrary. The dictator is the historical moment.
 "We continue to curse Comrade Stalin, of course, in a worthy way.
  But so, I want to ask. Who wrote the four million manuscripts?
  (This number is circulated in secret party documents).
 Dzerzhinsky?
 Yezhov?
  Abakumov and Yadoga?
  No way.
  They were written by ordinary Soviet people.
  Does that mean that the Russians are traitors?
 No way.
 The tendencies of the historical moment simply had an impact ”/ 4, page 56 /.
  Here is a remarkable fact. … A citizen stubbornly wanted to study his father's "case" to find out who betrayed him in time… He was allowed to look at the forbidden pages.
 It was necessary to see what was happening to him when he read that his father had testified against others… Not everyone wants to take into account the difficult times, ին what torture the testimonies were subjected to ”/ 8, p. 13 /.
  Nowadays, due to the dictates of time, the "forbidden fruits" of the stage are gaining interest, as well as potential discoveries.
 Nowadays there have been many references to this reality.
  Let us mention only a few of them in chronological order: David Gasparyan, The Closed Door Secret (Charents, Bakunts and others), Yerevan, 1994, Siak Arzumanyan, Modern Armenian Novel, Volume 5, WUA Publishing House, Yerevan, 2004, Halatova Karin , ДелоNo…, С пожелтевших страниц трагических судеб, Ереван, 2012.
"… Fate? Let there be fate. But such a long text on the forehead… should our fronts be wide, open, too wide and open… ”.
                                         Gurgen Mahari At the end of May 1936, Aghasi Khanjyan left for Moscow to take part in the June plenum of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. "I smelled that plenum" (1, p. 3) - Vahram Alazan refers to Aghasi Khanjyan's words many years later.
  In fact, A. Khanjyan's prophetic words were equal to absolute truth, and in the end one of the many shattered biographies happened to Khanjyan himself. "On July 9, Berian invited Khanjyan to Tbilissi (Georgia) for the sitting of the presidency of the Under-Committee.
 At that session, Beria demanded that Khanjyan confess that he was a nationalist. Stepanyan's nationalist group.
 After the session, Beria kills Aghasi Khanjyan in his closet and officially declares that Khanjyan "committed suicide in Tbilissi (Georgia) in a demonstrative way in order to quarrel the Armenian people with the Georgian people" (1, p. 4).
 By the way, these և many other testimonies (about the prison regime of 30-40) V. This memoir of Alazan is made valuable in terms of factual material.
 1990 Vahram Alazan's memoir "Through the Paths of Suffering" was published, which was written in 1961-1965. It simply could not be published earlier, like the works of Gurgen Mahari, Ler Kamsar, Walter Aramyan and many others.
  Even one human destiny will tell about the historical reality without distorting even a word of fear, because the more different the "manuscripts" of the individual-Siberians, the more the ways of their suffering are the same. Vorkuta, Basargechar, Kolima, Boguchan, Krasnoyarsk, Kuray և այլ many other glaciers, which were warmed only by the breath of an exile.
 The fact is accurately described by the great satirist, Ler Kamsar. So many people were exiled to Siberia that a "boogie" rose from there, the exiles, not being able to withstand the heat, "opened the door and window of Siberia to let a little coolness in through the burnt zone" (5, p. 102).
Ler Kamsar, who was a feuilletonist, had to react to events every day by force of force, to the pulse of the day, which he pressed his finger firmly on.
  And when he was already forbidden to express his thoughts, he "reacts" to the events with the same force, this time in the form of a diary.
 The satirist wrote a diary in exile, but, unfortunately, those diary fragments were not preserved.
 And what he really wrote, with rather stingy facts, but to some extent was recorded already in 1953-1958. in a reflective diary.
 Here are some pictures of it. "In Basargechar I wrote in the open air, under a folding grass, folded.
  In prison իս I turned my shoes upside down.
  In exile on the back of my good friend Davit Gharagyozyan.
  Poor man, he bent for hours in front of me without a grunting desk "/ 5, pp. 411-412, 77, 184 /.
Mount Kamsar wrote in all dangerous times, while his contemporary and fortune teller says with all caution. "I did not have a diary.
 What year was the diary kept when Beria և Stalin's spies even tried to read people's minds?
 Alazan himself was just "blogging" mentally.
 In the memoirs of other citizens of the Soviet country, their "freedom" was to be told, and a great saying was to be uttered, which in those years was really a mockery thrown at the face of time. "Man is the most precious capital" (I. Stalin) / 1, page 79 /.
And does not Alazan react to that same mockery with a mockery, noting: "Yes, man is the most precious capital.
 He opens the way for the horse ... ”/ 1, pp. 118-119.
 Three miles north of the camp was a large forest.
 In the summer months, firewood was made in the depths of the forest to transport to a camp on sledges in winter, but the heavy snow and blizzard blocked the only road leading to the forest, ին a horse tied to a sledge could not walk through the snow… It was left to snow on foot.
And Walter Aramyan is just the opposite. "Man is only the mockery of this life" / 2, page 17 /.
 And he, the man, is more than tormented by the violation of his own human dignity.
  Alazan's path of suffering has been long, full of uncertainty, which is more than torturous, but it was one of the many tricks used by the leadership.
  From the very first moment of imprisonment, like everyone else, Alazan is only shocked to see 37 notches on the prison wall.
 "Lord God, did my predecessor get used to these conditions for 37 days, and I thought I would return home in a few days" / 1, page 17 /.
  By the way, Gurgen Mahari finds himself in this same situation. "I thought that this story would end in days, they would check it and let it go" / 7, page 3 /.
  The same picture, or in another expression, also appears in Walter Aramyan's novel. The "new" prisoners refuse even food, always staring at the door, waiting for the "misunderstanding" to be revealed.
 But there is a sharp mockery. "Nothing, nothing, only the first ten years are difficult" / 2, page 12 /.
  It is clear that this was of a general nature, by one logic, trials are perishable, as they say.
  But in front of everyone, it was the same (twice, three times longer) path of suffering, to the valleys of death, where half-dead, half-buried or half-alive people "lived".
  Presenting the path of his suffering, Alazan reveals a wide horizon for the reader (և story), reveals manners, laws, even diet (see 1, pp. 189-190).
  Everything is the same in the whole big Soviet country.
 Alazan tells the story of people who, regardless of gender, age and ethnicity, are identified with the status they have acquired.
 The author describes in great detail the individual drama of the individual during the years of Stalin's dictatorship, from the first days of imprisonment to exile, to justification, "freedom", the second exile, to the coveted "death that gave life to tens of millions" (1, p. 226).
  Then, as a summary, the significant days and dates are singled out: "On July 9, 1954, we were released and acquitted" / 1, p. 238 /.
  And LerKamsar "shrugs its shoulders" with bitter contempt. "What difference does it make: does a person make people happy with his life or with his death" / 5, page 65 /.
  Alazan calls things by their names, and there is almost no artistic intervention.
Evaluating the activities of the Stalinist regime, the writer comes to an interesting and sharp definition. "One of the aspects of Stalin's massacre policy was that he was destroying another group of people through one group, who had already done his will, and was destroying that group through another group.
  The imprisonment of the Amatuni-Akopov-Mughdus gang was a manifestation of Stalin's policy "(1, p. 53).
 And this was still a part of that monstrous policy.
 "I was tormented by sleep at night, by insomnia during the day," and on the other hand, "the mystery, the uncertainty, the secret were specific to the Stalin era" (1, pp. 38,80), - the writer notes.
  One of the "discoveries" typical of that period was that all the way to Golgotha, political prisoners were accompanied by criminals as a shadow, as the supreme "method" of punishment. And the only undeniable truth was that they, who thought they were their leader, were not really wants to come to terms with the death of dying intellectuals.
  They wanted to destroy them with their own hands.
They knew their leader's "chosen taste" (2, p. 49).
To work as much as possible to lose և to forget the human face and dignity, to trample on self-love (why was the mirror banned in prisons in the first place…).
 And tricks as much as you can.
  In addition to the innumerable traditional tricks in the camp, new ones were invented day by day, and the criterion of success was cruelty. the more cruel, the more invaluable.
"If today they drive the vast land of Kolima by tractor, huge pyramids of bones of tortured prisoners will stand in front of you" / 1, page 110 /, wrote Walter Aramyan.
  The Russian writer Solzhenitsyn mentions 31 forms of punishment used in Soviet prisons, "labor camps in those years."
  The Stalin-Beria massacre machine was not capable of anything, just to achieve its goal.
  "The discretion of the ideology and practical propaganda of the cult of the individual was the flattening of the neglect of human individuality, its inexhaustible inner possibilities, leading its role to the usual" screw ", which could be adjusted or turned with the desired egg whenever you want" (3, p. 30).
 "The nightmare of Stalinism is not even that millions of people died.
  The nightmare of Stalinism is that it immoralized millions ”(4, p. 153).
 And no one would bear the responsibility!
 Gurgen Mahari presents this idea with his own palette. "What are you doing, boys? Why aren't you looking far? There is a history, there is a responsibility." One of the investigators put out his cigarette, pressing it on his professor's forehead. "As long as we exist, there will be no history, and when there is history, we will not be" / 6, p. 175 /.
… They are people of the same period, who are similar in that they are capable of thinking և (hence և) are exiles.
The mentioned writers are some bright personalities, but they are և similar to each other և thousands. They were united by fate.
 The event accurately defines Ler Kamsar. "All independent thinkers were imprisoned, the doors were closed.
 There are some newborns who have not yet started talking.
  As soon as they are kicked, they will be imprisoned… ”/ 5, p. 56 /, then, as a summary, he adds: "Probably whoever conquers Siberia in a war will inherit the whole brain of Russia" / 5, p. 105 /.
Մեկի During one of the interrogations, in fact, Vahram Alazan and Gurgen Mahari huddled next to each other in the "cages" next night.
  The atypical and unknown pages of Mahari's work have already been summarized in one book, which has a rather eloquent title, "Siberian".
 It was Gurgen Mahar's exile who coined the term "flowerbeds", which, being very impressive and accurate, is used today as a general definition of the literature representing the whole region (see 3).
  Siberia occupies almost two decades in Mahari's life. he was isolated from his family, his surroundings, his literary life.
Mahari, of course, was not alone. Yeghishe Charents, Axel Bakunts, Vahan Totovents, Zapel Yesayan, Ler Kamsar, Vagharshak Norents, Vahram Alazan met the same fate with him, with a small time difference with him.
 And the accusing bodies took care of that, preparing the accusation in advance. such examples as much as the accused.
"If you have committed a crime for yourself, fine. They will look at your crime and condemn you.
 And if you do not understand, they have all kinds of ready-made crimes hanging over them, they will clothe you, whoever sat on you, they will condemn you to that ”/ 5, p. 217 /,
 It was not difficult to get used to the status of a prisoner. Each day in prison he came to prove that what had happened was no exception, but another page of unprecedented tragic comedy.
 And the typical "formula" of distant glaciers is given by Grigor Achemyan. "Siberia… A country inhabited by multinational people, a country rich in natural resources ներով ներով Stalin's camps, which created the impression of real life, covering another worldly life flowing in parallel with the smoke.
 Siberia… Novoivanov camp or one of the departments of "Kraslag" hydra- "trust" / 7, pp. 3-24 /.
  Let's turn to Ler Kamsar again. "Russia արան Tomb of all freedom, locked speech, imprisonment of all valuable people and finally prisons, prisons and prisons, so much so that you can be called a prison-country and a penitentiary" / 5, pp. 239-240 /.
 Mahar completes what has been said with false indifference. "One could have had a good laugh if all this had been too tragic" (7, p. 693).
 No one can forget the living and the inanimate during the years of individual worship, even in case of the greatest desire.
 Mahari's characters are also real, which he referred to in the Siberian stories.
 And next to the characters, he is a writer with his own thoughts and memories.
  Without delving into the pages of the writer's "Siberian", let us only present the Mahari-Siberian word addressed to the future history. "Թող Let the everlasting statue, the creation of which I saw, and which still stands with ice on my heart, stand forever.
 It happened in the load, in the cruel zone of eternal ice.
  Outside the death camp, the young detainee was stopped on an icy hill visible from the camp, watered with buckets, and flushed.
 The water froze quickly, and an icy monument with human hands stood on the hill.
 It was the only monument to immortalize the memory of millions of dead and dying prisoners.
May that terrible monument stand forever.
 It was the frozen cry of the dead that the generations should hear their voice, remember, do not forget, remember, do not allow this terrible story to be repeated ”/ 6, page 56 /.
A distance, Kolima, from where almost no one had returned, but Walter Aramyan had returned.
 The writer speaks about the facts and events like the others with the knowledge of an eyewitness, but he gives a meaningful assessment to the events. he is not satisfied with just the pen of a documentarian.
  His hero is himself, but from the side, he said, in the third person.
 Speaking about the place of exile, the writer generalizes: "Here is the only place in the world where a person is" free "not only from the outpouring of emotions, but also from the need and ability to think.
 It is complete "freedom" to solve the issue of living or not living here.
  No one will disturb anyone if he wants to kill, if he cries, even if he wants to sing… "/ 2, page 45 /.
Աս Aghasi Khanjyan's wife, who was also arrested, secretly addresses her appeal to the lucky ones. "Come, endure all the difficulties, soon the day will come when the party will justify us all, will return us to the homeland" / 1, p. 111 /.
 His words came true, "and those who could not die, those who smiled and their eyes were sad began to return" / 6, p. 411 /.
Thus, we tried to present a picture of the reality of the 1930s, to draw the path of a few Armenian writers who went through the paths of Siberian suffering to the valleys of death, ostensibly based on their works.
