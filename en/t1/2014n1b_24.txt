The formation of a child's personality takes place first of all in the family, և family atmosphere, relations, upbringing have a decisive influence on the harmonious development of the child և mental health.
The child's character, self-consciousness, self-esteem, moral ideas, social attitudes are formed in the family, the child masters the rules of behavior, socialization of the person takes place.
Recently, family relationships have undergone significant changes.
 The number of mobile families consisting of spouses and children has increased.
  The functions of the spouses in the family, their value system, attitude towards children, methods of upbringing have changed.
It is very possible to study the changes in family relations, the causes of family conflicts, their impact on the harmonious development of the child's personality.
There are several definitions of "conflict".
 B. Մ. Rebus describes conflict as a "clash of incompatible tendencies" in each other's minds, associated with negatively intense emotional feelings "[4, p. 45].
According to A. V. According to Sergeychuk, "Conflict is a clash of incompatible goals, interests, attitudes, opinions, views of individuals" [5, p. 212].
   Unlike Rebus և Sergeychuk, AM Stolyarenko describes the conflict not as a clash, but as a contradiction. "Conflict is a sharp, difficult-to-resolve conflict between two or more people (groups) characterized by conflict, the mutual use of strong means by the opposing parties to win over the other side" [6, p. 294].
According to statistics, the main reason for family conflicts is the lack of communication culture, mutual trust, politeness, attention, kindness, sensitivity.
In fact, conflicts can be caused by psychological incompatibility, sexual problems, misunderstanding of each other's intentions, misinterpretations of behavior, different approaches to morality, lack of sense of duty, responsibility, etc.
A family is strong when good relations are established between couples, when different topics are freely discussed, when spouses have common interests, are capable of empathy, are flexible, and most importantly, when love is at the core of the family.
Emphasizing the role of family անեկան family relationships in the harmonious development of the child's personality, we identified the frequency of conflicts through a questionnaire involving 40 married couples from extended mobile families.
As a result of the questionnaire, we got the following picture: Diagram 1 Frequency of conflicts in extended տ mobile families In fact, in extended families, conflicts arise more often than in mobile families.
The family is expanded, where besides the spouses, there are other relatives besides their children.
 [1] Below are the types of family conflicts identified as a result of the study and their main causes.
1. Conflict between a married couple և.
 Conflict in a man-woman relationship can be caused by psychological incompatibility, the "heavy" character of one of the couples, sexual dissatisfaction, infidelity, inconsistency of worldview, value system, inability of a woman to solve everyday problems, financial problems, etc.
The conflict may be due to the crisis of family relations.
 The first crisis appears in the first year of marriage, especially when a child is born in the family, the second - in the 3-7th year of marriage, the third - in the 17-25th year.
   Marital conflicts often arise because of the physical and psychological incompatibility of couples.
 Psychological compatibility is conditioned by the type of temperament of the spouses և Character traits.
 The more similar couples are to each other in temperament, the more they irritate and tire each other.
A harmonious couple can be, for example, the sanguine husband and the melancholic.
Physical compatibility is conditioned by the structure of the body of a woman and a man, by the features of the genitals, which are essential in sexual life.
  It has been proven that sexual dissatisfaction and problems in intimate life cause coldness and indifference in male-female relationships.
When forming a family, it should be taken into account that the final formation of the male organism takes place at the age of 25, and the final formation of the female organism - at the age of 18-20.
 In addition, men have a longer sexual orientation than women.
 Therefore, from a biological point of view, it is desirable for a married couple to be older in order to have harmony in their sexual life [2, page 224] (see Table 1).
Age of Female-Male Sexual Harmony Chart 1. GenderWomen-Male Relationship Age Age The most common cause of marital conflicts is the view of men as a source of financial only.
 The thought that family members are financially dependent on a man begins to put pressure on his psyche.
 As a result, his connection with his wife and then with his children weakens.
There are also families where the level of econflict is quite high, the peace of the family is disturbed, there is tension in interpersonal relations.
 They are: o neurotic families, where the couple has a high level of anxiety, sleep disturbance, aggression, o crisis families, where the spouses are hostile to each other, do not take into account each other's interests, do not tend to compromise, o problem families, where there are problems, difficult living conditions As a result, the family finds itself in a precarious situation.
 Constant quarrels and conflicts definitely affect the mental health of both the couple and the child.
As a result of the conflict between the parents, the child may feel guilty, believing that he was the cause of the conflict.
 In some cases, the child may feel fear.
 This is especially true when a child sees scenes of parental quarreling or violence.
 Such children live with guilt, fear, isolation and anxiety, they may have nervous, psychosomatic or other diseases.
It should be noted that for some children the conflict becomes a common occurrence.
 Later, in adulthood, they show the same indifference to the people around them, events, become cold-hearted, have a low level of empathy.
 The parents of these children, being obsessed with finding out about relationships, do not notice that their child acquires negative character traits, commits unacceptable actions, exhibits antisocial behavior.
2. Conflict in parent-child relationships.
  In the family, the parent may have conflicts with children of different ages.
 The cause is the ignorance of the age-psychological peculiarities of the child, the lack of mastery of the upbringing, the failure to understand the intentions of the child, to consider him always a small, incapable person.
 The transition from the mitral stage to the next is accompanied by a crisis, which is not always smooth.
 The crisis can cause tension in relationships, especially at the age of three և in adolescence.
The cause of the three-year-old crisis is the existing contradiction between "satisfying" the child's needs.
  Children in this period become stubborn, stubborn, do everything against the demand, show a negative attitude towards adults, although it should be noted that the child's negativity towards everyone is not manifested. It is highly selective and is aimed specifically at those who try to suppress its freedom.
 Adults need to know that the three-year-old crisis is transient, indicating that the child is preparing to move on to the next stage of life.
 The awareness of the parents, their tolerance allow the temperature in the parent-child relationship to decrease, to create a gap.
A large number of conflicts arise during adolescence, which is due to changes in the psychological, physical and sexual life of adolescents.
  Adolescence itself is considered a crisis age, at this age the warm family relations, mutual trust, respect, mutual understanding are more important.
 At this age, the problem of "fathers and sons" often arises.
 In one case, a teenager begins to compare his ideas of an "ideal parent" with real parents; he sees that there is a huge difference between "ideal" and "real" parents.
In the other case, the adolescent, who has started a process of rapid physical development, sexual maturation, begins to consider himself great, and demands that everyone treat him as an adult.
  All teenagers, without exception, have that aspiration.
  Parents who continue to treat a teenager like a small child have serious problems.
In extreme cases, strained parent-child relationships lead to nervousness, depression, and violence.
Conflicts arise in parent-child relationships due to incorrect upbringing.
  The parent always tries to make his / her child exemplary, perfect by applying severe punishments, being rude, encouraging less, and sometimes showing cruelty.
 Unnecessary punishment, the rudeness of the parent, the cruelty in the child lead to two extreme manifestations. In the first case, the child grows up malignant, aggressive, in the second case, insecure, complicated.
At a young age, the child's aggression is manifested in the fact that the child begins to take out the doll's eyes, deliberately break the toys, tear the flowers, hit the cats and dogs in the yard with a stone.
 Prefers to play with "aggressive" toys - weapons, pistols, arrows and bows, etc.
Then the child's aggressive tendencies towards the people around him are revealed.
 The child uses physical force against the weak, tries to oppress them, humiliate them, cause pain.
Multiple observations have shown that the children of authoritarian-style parents grow up depressed, insecure, self-contained, constrained, untouched.
 They are not self-confident, they are not able to make self-determination, to organize their own life and work.
3. Conflict in child-child relationships.
 There are several reasons for the conflict in child-child relations.
  The first reason is the lack of attention to the child.
 As a rule, the birth of the second child in the family causes the child to feel rejected and neglected, which can turn into hatred towards both the parent and the sister or brother.
 Those who give birth after the birth of the second child should be more attentive to the firstborn, develop a positive attitude towards the newborn.
 The nature of the child-child relationship depends only on the parent.
The second reason for conflict in child-child relationships is parental discrimination between children.
 "In Armenian families, it is 'normal' to divide boys and girls between parents."
 Mothers usually love their children by giving them privileges, while fathers treat their daughters in the same way.
 From an early age, the child understands, feels the parenting attitude and begins to feel dislike for his brother or sister.
Conflict with other family members.
 If we compare the extended mobile families, we will see that in the extended families there are conflicts that simply cannot arise in the mobile families.
It is an accepted tradition in the Armenian reality when a boy gets married, lives with his wife in a paternal family, where, besides his parents, his brothers, sisters and other relatives live.
 The larger the family, the more difficult it is to maintain a friendly atmosphere.
  Studies of many families have shown that in extended families, the conflict mainly arises between the "mothers-in-law" of the bride.
  Conflicts can be caused by living conditions, financial problems, differences in education level, motherly jealousy, the bride's desire for self-affirmation, different approaches to raising a child, incompatibility of character, temperament, etc.
 Conflicts also arise between other members of the family when the issue of material well-being and inheritance arises.
At first glance, it seems that these types of conflicts do not affect the child's mental development, but when the child sees how the parents argue, insult, discredit each other, his mental state changes.
 Conflict situations make the child cold-hearted, uncommunicative, cruel, inattentive, aggressive, rude or insecure, self-contained, depressed and indifferent.
Summarizing the work done, we came to the conclusion that the unhealthy atmosphere of the family, the conflicting relations between the spouses definitely have a negative impact on the child.
 The child, who is always in a tense, stressful state, has a "heavy" character, is not able to establish relations with peers, adults, has inadequate, low self-esteem.
Arguments and conflicts are inevitable in any family, so every adult couple should soberly realize that they have a responsibility to raise and raise a healthy child.
 That is why the family should: 1. Minimize the number of conflicts and, if they arise, resolve them quickly. to create a peaceful, calm atmosphere in the family for the physical and mental development of the child, 3. Establish good neighborly relations with both the child and all family members based on love and respect.
