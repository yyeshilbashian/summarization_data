The world history of governance distinguishes two leading models: American-Japanese.
 Building each model of governance presupposes adapting to the customs, values ​​and mentality of a given nation.
 To date, studies have confirmed the propensity for the American model of governing Armenian enterprises [1].
  However, modern research has suggested the incompleteness of its effectiveness and the need to record the elements of collective management.
  These assumptions were based on our compatriots S. Harutyunyan և N. The results of Khachatryan's "Intercultural Study of the Cultural Values ​​of Armenians" study, according to which, according to the map of cultural territories proposed by Schwartz, Armenia is among the "cultural territories of South Asia" in Eastern Europe.
Intercultural analysis has shown that the dominance of belonging values ​​over autonomy values ​​is characteristic of Armenia, which is also important for the construction of a governance model [2, pp. 80-83].
 Just as the self of each person becomes more noticeable in social situations, so the real image of the representative of each nation can be seen more clearly in the social environments of other nations.
 Having lived for many years in all parts of the world, Armenians have displayed psychological features characteristic of their national character.
  In every country, wherever an Armenian lives, builds and is building schools and churches, which testify not only to the preservation of the national image, but also to the creation of an Armenian spirit around them on the way of self-affirmation and self-realization, all this is to feel the Armenian national potential.
 Regardless of the success of the effective combination of governance models, the most important task is the accurate placement of the national image in the governing motivational framework.
 If the individualistic nature of the American model and the public nature of the Japanese model stem from the uniqueness of the processes of nationalization and national preservation of the latter, then a harmonious combination of the two is acceptable to us.
  Striving for a separate assessment of individual contribution, at the same time we are inclined to the need to create a group spirit around us.
  E. referred to those who complete the human essence. Fromm's ontological demands for "connection" և to "roots", according to which people, while feeling an integral part of their world, need to separate and preserve their individuality at the same time.
  An effective management model can be built on the basis of the principles of individual evaluation and respect for human nature, while at the same time taking into account the exact psychological balance of the needs of being close to one's peers and constantly being compared to them.
Analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of the American-Japanese governance models, we can single out the following principles and provisions of governance that are most preferable to our national characteristics.1. Preference for a sound US government structure over a non-voiced Japanese one by reducing a large number of US levels of government, which would make individual levels of government more manageable and provide monthly reports more quickly and efficiently.
2. The preference of the American model of individual responsibility over the Japanese collective responsibility will allow each employee to measure the contribution made in order to pay more attention to his / her activities.
3. Instead of individual management decisions, joint discussion of issues with employees contributes, firstly, to the fact that employees skilled in the given work process can offer more optimal solutions, secondly, to feel their importance and effectiveness, their own contribution and responsibility in decision making.
  Making a final decision by combining the options discussed together will allow you to choose the most comprehensive, well-reasoned option for solving this problem.
4. As a means of individual management oversight, we believe that it would be true to have daily, monthly, and annual individual reports of individual group members based on quality and time spent, and group-based incentives for six-month reporting to facilitate group control and effective group control. .
5. Matching clearly voiced control procedures by management to non-voiced group control procedures.
  Clearly sound oversight procedures allow the employee to perform a consistent assessment of performance according to established standards, and constant awareness of all employee performance helps management provide timely feedback.
  Non-voiced control is exercised in a group setting where each individual is influenced and's interacted with by others.
6. Rapid evaluation of work results ապահով Providing feedback on the basis of relevant reports at the expense of individual efficiency քանակ Number of specializations.
7. Selection of the leader according to the number of different specializations տիր possession of flexible qualities.
 Within the same enterprise, group transfers of one to three to five employees from one specialized job to another, instead of a Japanese individual transfer, will allow all employees to become proficient in several specialties, and analysis of monthly և annual individual reports will help to see the higher performance of each. Orientation in the preference of the manager's management.
  As a result, it will be more realistic to deploy the employee with more advanced skills and potential opportunities in the required field, which will lead to the acquisition of a flexible, well-developed employee from the point of view of management, in addition, the employee will have the opportunity not only to test his strength in various fields. a clear preference for self-efficacy within.
  It is necessary to elect a manager with different specializations in the analysis of the work activities of the students.
  A person skilled in various specialties, in the case of quality control և management, will be able to offer more flexible means to employees, when making decisions to take into account the specifics of the production process to be a model for each employee by his example.
8. Preference for management style combined with individual group orientations, where monthly and annual reports are aimed at standardized measurement of individual productivity of employees, shortcomings and investments by the management and, according to the data, the salary system, incentive mechanism, ensuring service growth.
  Every three to five years, the relocation of the working group from one place to another facilitates the rapid adaptation and speed of training of employees transferred due to competition և group facilitation, and the publication of six-month group reports allows individual competition to be combined with group competition, which promotes double recruitment.
9. Orientation of managers towards achieving individual results in group template.
 Employee teamwork is about employee empathy, group facilitation, employee comparison, competition, and rapid adaptation, but each employee must be judged on his or her input and productivity, so the team is needed to create a positive work environment. is aimed at increasing employee productivity and activity within that field.
10. Accurate combination of formal and informal management relations with subordinates.
 The formal relations of the management will allow maintaining the organization of production activities according to the established standards, clear-regulated implementation of the activities of the employees tending to abuse the friendly approach, strengthening the objective position towards all the employees.
  In the conditions of the development of the manager's perceptual abilities, the informal relations with the employees will allow the formation of mutually trusting relations, the identification of work problems in order to provide timely solutions.
 The success of the combination of formal and informal relationships stems from the flexible, well-developed qualities of the manager, allowing to avoid the shortcomings of separate application of formal-informal relationships, without ignoring either the individuality of the employee or the seriousness of the perception of productive activities.
11. Service a conditioned by the individual efficiency of the employees քանակ the number of different specializations Ճ.
  Monthly, according to annual reports, determination of individual productivity, according to the number of specializations, salary increase.
12. According to in-house training every three to five years, in the Japanese model of specialization, the individual mobility of the employee, the group transfer of employees to another specialized part of the enterprise will allow employees to work in one profession for many years to avoid indifference and frustration. Instead of individual, group mobility of employees will help to adapt more quickly to the working characteristics of the new specialized department through group facilitation և to carry out professional training more quickly.
13. The provision of continuous training of employees through group shifts within the enterprise will increase their commitment to the enterprise, and the flexible salary system will encourage them to work to their full potential.
14. The preference for Japanese hierarchical governance over US general governance will allow the leadership to establish effective oversight and ensure constant awareness of all departments.
 The preference for a hierarchical nature of governance stems from the peculiarities of our national family model.
The successful implementation of any enterprise management model is largely due to the effectiveness of the use of means and mechanisms of impact on human resources.
 The integrity of the governance model is determined by the comprehensiveness of the human being.
  Taking into account the dynamics and constant variability of the motivational sphere of human nature, it is necessary to create a multi-layered and flexible motivation system, which will enable the maintenance of a stable motivational field in the presence of constant variables of the external environment.
