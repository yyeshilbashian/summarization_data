1. Introduction.
 Modern methods of teaching mathematicsOne of the tasks is to make a connection with learning in real life.
Everyone knows that knowing and being able are not the same.
 Laws have been passed at different times, according to which in the programs ևChanges have been made to existing math textbooks,which were mainly related to computational and measurement skillsstrengthening.
 Of course, these changes have been welcomedto increase learners' interest in the subject because:The approximate calculations, the solution of production-technical problems, the performance of various economic calculations expanded the schoolThe structure of mathematics եցին created conditions in real lifeto understand the meaning of mathematics.
 To date, however, not enough attention has been paid to teaching studentsapply the knowledge gained in practice.
 When solving a problem from the questionnaire, the student deals with the problem formulated, but in real life the employee is required to formulate the problem on their own.Decide for yourself what other sizes depend on the size you are looking forvalue գտնել find that value on your own.
  Therefore, in school, students need to be taught to separate certain practical problems from real conditions on their own, such as finding it on their own.the values ​​of the quantities on which the answer to the question depends.
The implementation of practical laboratory work in the teaching process plays an important role in the successful application of mathematical theory in practice, which develops the ability of students to do such work, which will turn over the years.of skill.
2․ Laboratory և practical work concepts.
 Existence:They have a number of options for defining concepts such as math lab work.
 Laboratory work in mathematics by studentsare the independent solution of such problems, the conditions of which are givenwith certain technical details, in different subjects orwith specially made models, drawings, images ևetc.
 Used to achieve certain learning goals, privatelyIn this case, the mathematical knowledge gained by the students is practicalto turn skills and abilities.
Laboratory work is a method of teaching that is usedStudents, under the guidance of a teacher ված pre-designedaccording to the plan, conduct experiments or practiceproblem solving. learners perceive at work և
They make sense of the new teaching material, reinforce the previous knowledge.
Thus, laboratory work can be investigatedIt can act as a method, as a tool, as a means of teaching.
Doing laboratory work in mathematics is not opposed to doing practical work.
 The students' independent work is practical, the purpose of which is to check the theoretically proven facts, relationships, dependencies of individual specific cases, in practice theoreticalis the application of knowledge, the solution of practical problems, etc.
Laboratory work can not be directly replacedpractical work.
  On the contrary, they provide the lattergood preparation for performance.
 Practical workMathematical theory is applied to real performancein spatial terms և quantitative relations, notwith artificially created models, hence pedagogyIt is valuable from the point of view.
  That's why math is practicalThe work must be absolutely mandatorybein each class.
Laboratory work is a necessary preparatory stage for practical work, but laboratory work has a number of advantages over practical work.which makes them more in terms of the learning processvaluable. 1) are easier to implement (in class, during class), 2) are easy հեշտ to grasp students սովոր to understand մեծ its magnitudes
3) require less time than practitioners;promotes the activation of all learners ն best explains the role of mathematics in solving practical problems, 5) conductingIt is easier to provide all the participants independentlyperformance of work.
3 ․ Several types of laboratory work.
 To develop and strengthen learners' interest in mathematicsIn the training process can be included laboratory workdifferent types.
  It takes place during the execution of that workHas a conscious mastery of the educational material, development of abilities and skills.
 Let's distinguish several types of laboratory work, which are expedient to use at different stages of the learning process ․a) Definition of a specific mathematical object, objectbelonging to the given definition.
 The steps behind the operation of defining mathematical objects consist of the following steps: 1) enumeration of all properties in definitions, 2) logic in definitions
Establishment of connections, 3) adjustment according to the examples given in the definition, 4)Receipt: Does the object belong to the class of objects defined by the definition?
Laboratory work 1.
 Equivalent triangle decision.
A triangle is called equilateral if its two sidesare equal.
Let's bring the actions in the form of a table: Object properties:Example:Triangleyes § + ¦, no §-¦Both sidesare equal.yes § + ¦, no §-¦Follow-up.

 A fraction is called irregular if its numerator is greater than or equal toto the announcer.
Let's bring the actions in the form of a table: 2.

The logical-mathematical analysis of the assertion assumes: 1) Explanation of the statement, condition և conclusion of the passagesseparation, 2) general skill in working with theorems.

4. Conclusion.
  The organization of laboratory-practical work is very important in the process of teaching mathematics, it is one of the important and urgent problems of the organization of the school course.
  The use of various means of play, didactics, information systems in elementary school is strictIt needs և needs serious discussion.
The article presented laboratory works aimed at testing and summarizing the acquired knowledge.Laboratory works aimed at introducing new mathematical objects, proving theorems in a systematic way, forming a schematic representation.
Laboratory-practical works were brought from the elementary school,which are implemented through the use of ICT as a learning: practicea means of checking and discussing some topics of elementary methodology ևfor didactic depiction.
