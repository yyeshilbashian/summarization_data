1. Introduction.
 One of the problems of modern methodology of teaching mathematics is the implementation of teaching - connection with real life.
Everyone knows that knowing and being able are not the same.
 Laws have been passed at various times, according to which changes have been made to the current mathematics textbooks in the curriculum, mainly related to the strengthening of computational-measurement skills.
 Undoubtedly, these changes have successfully reflected the increase of students' interest in the subject, as the calculus calculations, the solution of production-technical problems, the implementation of various economic calculations expanded the structure of school mathematics, created conditions for understanding the meaning of mathematics in real life.
 To date, however, insufficient attention has been paid to teaching students to apply the knowledge they have acquired in practice.
 When solving the problem from the application book, the student deals with the problem formulated, but in real life the employee is required to formulate the problem independently, to decide on what other quantities the value of the quantity sought depends, to find that value independently.
  Therefore, in school it is necessary to teach students to separate certain practical problems from the real ones, such as to find the values ​​of the quantities on which the answer to the question depends.
The implementation of practical laboratory work in the learning process plays an important role in the successful application of mathematical theory in practice, which develops students' ability to do such work, which will become a skill over the years.
2․ Laboratory և practical work concepts.
 There are a number of ways to define concepts such as math lab work.
 Mathematics laboratory work is the independent solution of such problems by the students, the conditions of which are given in a certain technical detail, with models, drawings and pictures made for it in different subjects or specially.
 They are used to achieve certain learning objectives, in particular, to translate the mathematical knowledge acquired by students into practical skills and abilities.
Laboratory work is a teaching method in which students, under the guidance of a teacher, carry out experiments or solve practical problems according to a pre-designed plan. During the work, the students perceive the new educational material, reinforce the previously acquired knowledge.
Thus, it can be deduced that laboratory work can act as a method, as a tool, as a means of teaching.
Doing laboratory work in mathematics is not opposed to doing practical work.
 The independent works of the learners are practical, the purpose of which is to check the dependence of theoretically proven facts, relations, individual specific cases, in practice the application of theoretical knowledge, the solution of practical problems, etc.
Laboratory work cannot directly replace practical work.
  On the contrary, they provide good training for the latter.
 In the course of practical work, mathematical theory is applied in real space, in quantitative relations, not in artificially created models, and is therefore valuable from a pedagogical point of view.
  That's why doing math homework should be absolutely mandatory in every classroom.
Laboratory work is the necessary preparatory stage for practical work, but laboratory work has a number of advantages over practical work, which make them more valuable in terms of the learning process. 1) they are easier to implement (in the classroom, during the lesson), 2) they are easy to understand, available to the learners, they simplify the quantities needed to solve the problem, 3) they require less time than the practitioners, 4) the preliminary work is done; promotes the activation of all learners before the relevant practical work և best explains the role of mathematics in solving practical problems; 5) it is easier to ensure the independent work of all participants during the conduct.
3 ․ Several types of laboratory work.
 Different types of laboratory work can be included in the learning process to develop and strengthen learners' interest in mathematics.
  During the performance of these works, there is a conscious mastery of the educational material, the development of abilities and skills.
 Let us distinguish several types of laboratory work, which are expedient to use at different stages of the learning process. A) Bringing the definition of a specific mathematical object, the object belonging to the given definition.
 The steps behind the operation of defining mathematical objects consist of the following steps: 1) enumeration of all properties in the definitions, 2) confirmation of the logical connections in the definitions, 3) specification according to the examples given in the definition, 4) receipt of the reference: does the mentioned object belong to the class of objects characterized by the definition?

 Equivalent triangle decision.
A triangle is called an equilateral if its two sides are equal.
Let's bring the operations in the form of a table: Object PropertiesExample Triangle § + ¦, no §-¦ Both sides are equal: yes § + ¦, no §-ևReturn.
It is an equilateral triangle. Yes § + ¦, no §-¦ Laboratory work orientation.
 A fraction is called irregular if its numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator.
Let's bring the actions in the form of a table: 2.
  Irregular Fraction PropertiesFraction is: yes § + ¦, no §-¦The numerator is greater than the denominator.yes § + ¦, no §-ամThe numerator is equal to the denominator.
 The given object is irregular. Yes § + ¦, no §-¦Exampleb) Logical-mathematical analysis of mathematical statements և general skills in working with theorems.
The logical-mathematical analysis of the assertion presupposes: 1) explanation of the assertion, condition-conclusion, separation of the passages, 2) general skill of working with theorems.
