E. Charents (1897-1937) is the originator of modern Armenian literature. He expanded the field of artistic thinking, predetermined the ways of further development of literature, updated the language, the grammar, enriched the literary genres.
  1922 He published an article entitled "Declaration of the Three", which was a literary manifesto "signaling the entry of innovation into Armenian literature", in particular, poetry.
  The article denied the literary merits and experience of the past, the literary contribution, even the literary method and heritage of great writers, but it aimed to update and put Armenian literature on the path of new problems.
  Charents later abandoned these ideas, becoming the writer's "great spiritual conversion" [1, 344] և he was able to create his highly valuable works.
  It is invaluable E. Not only the greatness of Charents' talent, but also the influence he left on Armenology.
Federico Garcia Lorca (1898-1936) was the leader of the literary circle of his time, the two brightest representatives of the "27th generation".
  He was not only close to some of the poets, but also to the world representatives of natural surrealism, Salvador Dali, and the film director Luis Buյուuel.
 Thus, Lorca was at the epicenter of Spanish avant-garde.
  Lorca is the most influential Spanish writer of the 20th century, one of the peaks of Spanish drama.
  He presents his literary beliefs and aesthetic views in numerous lectures ("Duende's Theory և The Game", "The Poetic Image of Don Luis Gongora", etc.).
 He was against the "dehumanization" of Gasset's art, he was an innovator (interested in surrealism), but at the same time Lorca's lyric poetry is characterized by the features of national culture հատուկ the special musicality of the poem.
As E. In Charents' first poems, especially in the six-page book "Three Songs of a Sad Girl" (1914), it was felt that V. Teryan's influence, as well as Lorca's 1921 The influence of R. Dario և Jimenez was felt in the first collection entitled "Book of Poems".
 Later, both of them overcame their literary influences, had a search period, and appeared as innovators, which made them the peaks of 20th century Armenian-Spanish literature.
The thirties became years of creative growth for both writers.
 During this time they wrote not only many valuable works, but also a collection of poems.
  The name is connected with the cultural event dedicated to the three hundredth anniversary of Luis de Gongora's death in 1927, the participants of which were called representatives of the "27th generation".
that brought a new quality with their artistic features, ideological-compositional solutions.
 1929 Lorca travels to America, և travel impressions are reflected in the collection "The Poet in New York", and in 1933. Charents writes the collection "Book of the Road".
 Interestingly, these collections were banned for many years, only to be published after the death of the writers, without being censored.
The events of the 20th century do not differ tragically in Spain ությունում in the Soviet Union.
 Stalin came to power in the 1920s, and General Franco in Spain in the 1930s. two dictators who caused thousands of distorted destinies.
 Both poets were extremely sensitive, they immediately reflected on the events of the time with their poetry.
 This was the main reason that in 1936 In November, Charents was accused of being a counter-revolutionary, nationalist, Trotskyist, terrorist, was placed under house arrest, and later arrested.
1936 G. arrested in August Lorkan. He was accused of "being a Russian spy, communicating with them by radio, and being homosexual" [5, 476].
 Victims of the same cruelty, the two poets are sentenced to death at the same time, the location of their two graves remains unknown.
 1936 In June, on the eve of his death, Lorca wrote: And I do not want to mourn. I must look into the eyes of the dying… Silence, I said Silence.
We will drown in the sea of ​​mourning ո՞ւ Do you hear me ռ Silence, I said silence, Silence 3.
      (Toghatsi translation is ours-SK.) ¡Silencio! (Quote source: https.
//www.lainsignia.org/2004/junio/cul_065.htm).
We see the dense picture of silence in Charents' recent works, especially in the poem "Untitled". On the day of my death there will be silence, He will sit heavy on the city Imprisoning my silent heart.
1936 On August 18, 1945, Lorca was shot dead on the road from Wisnar to Alfakarta.
According to one of the hypotheses (according to Samson Stepanyan's testimony that he was supposedly Charents' shooter), on the morning of November 27, 1937, Charents was shot near the village of Fantan.
Lorca's poetry is dominated by the theme of death և this is due to the fear of death that torments him.
 "In his (Garcia Lorcai-SK) poetry, the popular-fateful expectation of death is preserved;
Tragedy is one of the dimensions of Lorca's entire work, the quality of his worldview.
 The tragic worldview is characteristic of many poets of the 20th century, who, realizing their rejection of the whole collective, sought to bridge that gap [2, 411].
 Lorca understood that the difficult, morbid development of modern art was connected with the separation of the artist և art, the collective whole [2, 418], which willy-nilly led to the personal drama of the poet and the individual.
  "I feel far removed from the present poetic decline; I dream of the coming dawn, when the incomprehensible feeling of the past will return," [3, 102], Erna wrote to her friend in 1929.
  Charents touched upon the topic of death in his "Visions of Death".
"The logic of life pushes him to the subject of death, he is connected with many threads with the tragic reality, the current of the newest poem, which brought the story of the way of the Ashes of Death" [1, 419], writes literary critic H. Tamrazyan.
 The theme of the great tragedy unfolds in his work, having literary, especially vital sources [1, 420].
The sun sets in the dark, Death sifts the ashes from the moon, The darkness dies in the twilight, The sun sets in the dark.
 My thoughts are death, they are dark, Marche's thoughts only swallow, And the sunset murmurs, Death sifts the ashes մ The theme of death is evident not only in the recent works of Charents, which was conditioned by the prediction of his own death ստեղծագործ in the previous sense of the coming catastrophe.
  The tragic fate of their own people, especially the facts of genocide, deprivation of the homeland, further emphasized the concerns of the great poet and patriot.
 If the works of the first period mentally depict the mortal pursuit of his people, then in the last years of his life the sense of the tragedy of his personal drama increases.
An interesting similarity can be seen in the high appreciation and appreciation of their art after the death of the two poets.
  A similar parallel can be drawn between the typical poems that became famous after their death. "
Lorca's poems entitled "Dark Love Sonnets" - "Charents' antypes, some of which, by the way, Charents calls a sonnet, are similar in terms of content", even some poems are characterized by the similarity of the pictorial system.
Undoubtedly, the topic is multi-layered, but in the case of the presented volume, it is impossible to fully deepen the similar philological-bio-psychological facts in the article, which, however, we will try to present in further studies.
Thus, the above-mentioned study shows how two talented writers of the 20th century went through the same creative path independently, addressed similar topics, created a similar artistic pictorial system.
E. The study of Charents-G. Lorka's literary features makes the greatness and talent of artists obvious. Both, being close to the roots of national culture and poetry, nevertheless were able to go from the national to the universal through their poetry, as a result of which the depiction of national issues in the fictional text acquired universal, universal significance.
