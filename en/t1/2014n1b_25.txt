    One of the main aspects of freshman adaptation is the establishment of permanent and strong social ties in the new environment, the formation of new small groups, the involvement in formal and informal groups.
    In the new environment, the role distribution is carried out in a new way, ում in the new system of relations, the student has to strengthen his / her positions independently.
  As K. Marx rightly pointed out that the development of a person is conditioned by the development of all the individuals with whom he is in direct or indirect communication.
 In this process, the exchange of beliefs, ideas, attitudes, interests, activities takes place, the system of "subject-subject" relations is developed / 6, page 7 /.
It is no secret that the student is formed in the student staff, and the favorable psychological atmosphere of the staff բարձր the high level of mutual understanding promotes friendship, trust, mutual assistance, development of positive personal qualities, overcoming academic difficulties and achieving success in learning.
The student body has its peculiarities և differs from the others: a) main type of activity / education /, b) age, uniform educational staff, c) stability of the staff, d) planning and sequence of educational activities, e) general purpose, that is, profession to receive.
The aim of the article is to reveal the peculiarities of understanding each other in the communication process of the freshmen, the difficulties of adaptation.
The task is to study the communication sphere of the freshmen, the process of mutual understanding, overcoming the difficulties of adaptation.
The process of understanding each other is a prerequisite for communication; it can be called the perceptual side of communication.
  And what does it mean? One person's perception of another is called a social perception.
 This concept was first used by J. Bruner in 1947, when he developed "New Look", "New Look". Later soc. Groups called social perceptions the processes of understanding "social objects" as well understood by other people, social groups և social communities {2, p. 138}.
Social understanding is possible to know and understand the other person, during which the more complete the person discovers the other person, the more complete the ideas he / she becomes about himself / herself.
The freshmen gradually begin to be actively involved in the structure of the interpersonal group of the student group, they begin to recognize each other's personal personal qualities, which take place both during communication and during cognitive activities.
  They become calmer and more balanced.
Direct communication with other people plays a key role in getting to know each other, assessing abilities, and behaving appropriately {2, p. 128}.
The means and content of communication determine the social functions of the people involved in those relationships, their position in the system of public relations, in this case, student relations.
Communication, as noted by K. Stanislavsky, "is the opposite current."
Each of its stages acts as a connected action, in which the actions of the participants are united into a whole that carries new qualities.
The freshman cooperates, communicates with the members of the group, is based on the experience gained during this or that activity, and because the life experience of different people is different, the opportunities to know and understand others are also different.
  And according to the data, there is a lot of anxiety, social stress, a certain crisis of communication with peers {2, 135}.
 However, they decrease at the beginning of the second year, as the classmates gradually get to know each other better, the interpersonal contacts, communication styles, mutual understanding and mutual understanding are strengthened.
Interpersonal relationships include 3 components of student interaction.1. behavioral, 2. emotional, 3. cognitive.
  Behavioral includes activity արդյուն the results of actions, activity styles, actions, facial expressions, gestures, movements և finally speech, that is, everything that man's person expresses և can be observed by other people.
Emotional includes everything related to situations. emotional states due to interpersonal conflicts, etc.
Cognition includes all the mental processes of the person in interaction, which are connected with knowing both the environment and the other person / 6, p. 161 /.
 Knowledge of the socio-psychological features of interpersonal understanding, we are sure, will help students to adapt more easily, to build the right relationships, to reduce the inevitable conflicts, to improve the educational process.
 To substantiate all that, among the freshmen of the Physical Education Department of VSPI Faculty of Physics and Mathematics in 2010-12. We have conducted research, surveys, discussions, observations, tests, debates. a feeling associated with being involved in a student's new social environment.
We offered them to mention the problems, difficulties that arise especially at the beginning of the academic year, due to not understanding, not recognizing each other during the first year, competition, opposite goals, motives or other reasons.
We asked the students to point out the ways that will enable them to bypass, mitigate or eliminate the existing problems.
The above condition the urgency and necessity of the article.
In the new conditions, there is a false sense of freedom among freshmen, which is conditioned by the need for self-organization of work, the right distribution of their own forces.
It is known that everyone can be persuaded to take some actions if they are aimed at satisfying our psychological needs.
 There are 14 basic requirements, two of which are especially important.1. personal strength, 2. Satisfaction of the "ego" (pride, self-awareness), curiosity, emotional security, belonging to a group, love, being loved, recognition, encouragement from peers, the ability to create, inviolability of privacy, material security, self-esteem, high self-esteem, success / 3, pp. 174-175 /.
One of the key factors in improving freshman understanding is: • mutual trust, as people are always striving to communicate, socialize with honest, trustworthy people, • the ability to overcome the duality and uncertainty of their own emotions.
 This is especially true for rigid students. • The effectiveness of social perception in a freshman group depends on the individual type of observer-subject, the individual perception of the group, ie how the group is perceived by the individual, • the problem of adaptation, • self-knowledge, recognition and understanding .
 From the beginning of the 2nd year, the above-mentioned problems gradually start to decrease, the level of satisfaction in the relations of the classmates starts to increase.
 At that stage, they think that the group գիտ knows more about each other, և now they are more interested in it than it was in the first year.
We considered the communication peculiarities of freshmen և generalizing we can say that: Understanding arises in the conditions of natural communication, understanding of each other, human interaction.
  It depends on the partner's emotions, opinions, attitudes, beliefs, etc.
By influencing the communicating party, the person seeks to transform his / her ideas about himself / herself in the necessary, favorable direction.
Understanding another person by one person is a mandatory condition of communication, therefore social understanding presupposes: self-knowledge, recognition of communication partner, organization of joint activities on the basis of mutual understanding, establishment of emotional relations, etc.
  Identifying the causes of the psychological difficulties of social understanding, communication and adaptation of the freshmen discussed in the article և Knowledge will help students to get to know each other more easily, to communicate, to adapt, which will help not only to improve their educational process, but also to develop personality.
