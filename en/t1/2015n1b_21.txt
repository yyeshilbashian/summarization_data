It is known that the sciences studying the population were mainly formed in the initial period of the development of capitalist relations, that is, in the XVII century. at the beginning.
  The authorities of the European colonial states were more interested in seizing the wealth of the transatlantic regions - the labor force, and for that they needed excellent ethnic composition, culture, employment, social and industrial relations.knowledge.
 They were conditioned by the colonial policythe development of anthropological, anthropological sciences.
 Based on the logic of colonization, XIX century. Russian և:
Ethnography or ethnography has been taught in European universities.
 The course covered the distribution, reproduction, employment of the world's ethnic groups, revealed the process of ethnocultural and linguistic development.
 From the economic, political, scientific interests of Russia, France, Germany, England, the United States, to the study of ethnological sciencesThe methodology was different because, unlike Russia, the colonies of England and France were scattered and located in the transatlantic territories.
 Under such circumstances, greater efforts were required from Great Britain to control the colonies, and to that endOne of the main preconditions for achieving this was an excellent knowledge of the ethnic groups living in the colonies.
  The application of the well-known geopolitical provision "Divide and Conquer" enabled the British government to rule the ethnic groups living in its colonies.
Ethno-geography, occupying a frontier position in the system of sciences, studies the reproduction, distribution, resettlement, displacement և composition of ethnic communities in the world, regions, states և settlements.
  The only environment for the development of ethnographic sciences was universities and other educational institutions.
  Ethnography or ethnography developed from the beginning.
  XVII-XVIII centuries Ethnology has been taught at well-known European universities: Sorbonne, Bologna, Berlin, Oxford and other universities.
 The term ethnography was first introduced into scientific circulation by the French scholar Jean-Jacques Amper in his monograph De l'histoire de la poésie (1830).page 5].
 At the initial stage of development, ethno-geography was formedin the system of ethnological sciences.
  In contrast to ethnography, ethnography was formed later.
Some scholars consider ethno-geography to be a branch of ethnography, while others consider it to be a branch of geography.
  The third group of experts considers ethno-geography to be the frontier of sciencea branch formed by ethnography, demography and populationin the node of geography [6, page 13].
Ethno-geography, as an independent branch of science, is connected with ethnography, ethnography, ecology, psychology, sociology, demography, population geography և other scientificwith branches.
  One of them is ethnic anthropology, which studies the anthropological or physical development of ethnoses և ethnogenetic issues.
  In England և in the USA in the XIX century. end of the century և
XX century At the beginning, physical and cultural anthropology was formed.
It studies the spheres of culture that are the result of the physical and caring activity of human society.
 In other words, the object of study of these branches of science is man, his biologicalև with social features [1, page 12].
 Closely related to ethno-geography, ethnosociology studies the social problems of the development and activities of ethnic communities.
 It pays attention to the identity of ethnic groups, self-organization և interethnic relations.
 Ethnology is a science that studies the origin of ethnoses (ethnogenesis), historicalevolution (ethnic history), ethnic commonalities ևdifferences, as well as ethnic processes are historicalin different periods, and ethno-geography studies the reproduction, composition, movements and և resettlement of ethnic communities.
  The object of study of both ethnography and ethnography is ethnoses.
 The ethnos of the worldresearch sciences pay attention.• The self-consciousness of ethnic communities.
 He does thatethnosociology.
• Ethnoculture studies the traditional թն ethnos ևmodern culture, way of life, customs.
• Ethnic languages ​​և dialects study ethnolinguistics.
• From the directions of ethno-geography, ethno-demography studies the reproduction of ethnos, demographic conditions, marriages, family composition.
• Ethnopsychology studies the mentality, character, psychology of ethnos.
• Social anthropology studies the և social structure և structure of ethnos.
In addition to ethno-demography, the directions of ethno-geography are ethnotoponomics (studies ethnonyms), ethnoecology, ethno-political geography.
  Ethnoecology deals withdifferent ethnic groups, quality of living environment և nature useby study.
  Ethno-political geography studies the social and political life of different ethnic communitiesthe life.
Ethno-geography is more closely connected with ethnography.
 Ethnography (French: ethnographie, Greek: έθνος—
netew + yράφω— I write) studies the material և care of ethnosculture.
 Along with ethnography in Western scientific circlesThe term "ethnography" is also used.
 In Russian scientific literature, the term "ethnography" is sometimes used interchangeably with "ethnography".
  In the Anglo-Saxon countries, ethnography is classified as an anthropological science"Cultural anthropology".
  The GermansThey use the term "ethnography" (volkerkunde).
The term ethno-geography was first introduced into science by the Bolshevik revolutionary, ethnographer-linguist.V. Bogoraz-Tan.
 One of his famous monographs is "The Spread of Culture on Earth. Основы этнодемографии "(1928), where the ethno-geographical zoning was carried out for the first time.
 In the 1930s heHe taught ethnography at Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) State University.
  It is worth mentioning that St. PetersburgUniversity Faculty of Physics and Mathematics Anthropology ևThe chair of ethnography was opened in 1887. E. Led by Petty.
 Ethno-geographical studies are carried out in educational and scientific institutions by various scientific foundations.in state scientific institutions, scientific and social organizations.
  One of the most important methods of ethno-geographical research is the use of sources, in particularPopulation censuses conducted in the Russian Empire in the 19th century ները Censuses, most of which fall into the 20thcentury.
  The first to use this method was the head of the Russian geographical company P.P. Semyonov Tian Shyansky.
Used in ethno-geographical researchfrom sources, folklore and archeological materials, scientificfrom literature, monographs, articles, field ethno-geographical materials, official, statistical, populationներից from census data.
  Ethno-geographical studies use partial-specific onesmethods.
  One of the common methods used is cartographic,historical, comparative-analytical, statistical, etc., and from the partial methods, ethno-geographical survey, conversation-monitoring methods.
Field has a special place in ethno-geographyresearch.
 This method enables the scientist to gather information about the material culture, reproduction, movement, and resettlement of ethnic groups.

From European countries in the development of capitalismThe methodological scientific basis of ethnographic and ethno-geographical studies was laid in Germany.
 F. was great in that. Hegel
(1770-1831) the philosophical teaching of "absolute idealism" or "objective idealism", which accepted the primacy of the spirit or idea, the idea of ​​և the secondary of matter [2, p. 444].
  Ethno-geography in Germany has developed in the system of ethnographic sciences.
 One of the founders of ethnography: diffusionismOne of the theorists F. It is Ratzel (1844-1904).
  One of his famous monographs is the work "Ethnography".
 He was a bearer of nationalist ideas, the "Pan-German Union" partyHe has been teaching geography at Munich State University since the 1880s [3, p. 504].
In France, ethnography was originally called ethnography.
 The focus of French ethnographic and ethno-geographical studies was the study of the traditional occupation, ethnic composition, structure and interethnic relations of the population of the colonized countries.
  Paris ethnographic society in 1839 established ethnography as an independent science
branch, and XX c. At the beginning he renamed it ethnography.
 Ethnography has been taught in almost all social sciences departments of French universities.
In England, the science of ethnos developedin the system of anthropological sciences.
  The English School of Anthropology studied the ethno-demographic and ethno-geographical processes of the population of the colonized countries.
  Anthropology The scientific direction "social anthropology" has been formed in the system of science, which is the same ethnology.
 Anthropology as a science was formed in the XIX century. in the middle.
 Anthropology:One of the founders is P. Broca.
 He taught in the 1860s and '70sAt the Medical Faculty of the Sorbonne University.
 Founded in 1858 in ParisAnthropological Society, and in 1868 - the Laboratory of Anthropological Studies, in 1875 - the School of Anthropology.
 Similar anthropological institutions were established in London (1863);In Moscow (1864), Madrid (1865), Berlin and elsewhere.
 XIX century In the west!
A number of directions emerged that sought to justify the idea of ​​racial inequality.
In the United States, ethnography is called "physical anthropology."Anthropology was considered one of the directions of science.
  Physical anthropology studies the racial composition of ethnic groups.placement և attributes.
  One of the directions of physical anthropology is ethnic anthropology [8, p. 350].
 This subject is taught in medicine and history of universities in the United States and European countriesներում in the faculties of natural geography.
 XX century In the second half of the 20th century, the study of the culture of the world's ethnic communities in anthropology became more active, as a result of which it was formed
The scientific branch of "cultural anthropology".
In Russia, the study of ethnic groups beganto deal with the XVIII century. from the second half.
 XIX century In the first half, Russian scientists K.M.
Ber, NN Nadezhdin, K.D. Kavelin developed Russian ethnography
The concept of development, where more attention was paid to the study of the composition and culture of the world's ethnic communities.
The founders of the Russian ethnographic school are N.N. Miklukho-McLay և D. Anuchin.
Ethnography is a highly ideological science in the USSRThe main focus was on the class structure of the world's ethnic communities և inter-ethnic class relations.
  The ties between geography and ethnography were strengthened in the Soviet scientific life, and as a result, the scientific branch of ethno-geography was formed in the 1920s.which is located at the junction of ethnography և population geography.
In the methodology of ethno-geographical research, Yu. Bromley (dualistic) և L. The theories put forward by Gumilyov (ethnogenesis).
 Anthropological studies had a certain influence on the development of Soviet ethno-geography.
  Adjacent to Moscow University in 1919The Chair of Anthropology was founded, and in 1922 the Institute of Anthropology was established.
 Soviet anthropology was characterized by planned work և development of common methods.
  Soviet Anthropology ևD. had a great contribution in the development of ethno-geography. Ն. Anuchin, V. V. Bunak, G. F. Debets, V. V. Ginsburg, M. Գ. Lane, M .; F. Nesturch, W. P. Alexen, V. Bogorastan, Yu. Bromley, L. Gumilyov և others.
Ethno-geographical and ethnographic studies were carried out at the Lomonosov Moscow State University. Ն. After Anuchin

The globalization of the modern world գործընթաց the processes of unificationcontribute to the activation of ethno-geographical studies.
 In this regard, the subject of ethno-geography is taught in higher educational institutions.
 Published to promote ethno-geographynumerous teaching manuals.
  One of the well-known teaching methods of modern ethno-geography is A. Ն. Asauli և
Others "Ethnogeographical factors of globalization and regionalization of peace"(St. Petersburg, 2010).
  There is attention in that manualbecome a population in the world և regionsthe change of ethno-geographical processes, their impact on the application of regional-global ethno-demographic policy.
 A special place is given to the world's populationethno-demographic quantitative-qualitative changes, interethnic conflicts.
  A. taught in Russian universities. Ն. Yamskov "Ethnogeography and geography of religion" (2008), և N.V. Alpatov, "Ethnogeography and geography of religion" (2008) teaching methodological
manuals, where attention is paid to the change in the national composition and structure of the world's population.
  It is worth mentioning that before!1991 Ethno-geography in the universities of the USSR, including the Armenian SSR
The subject was not taught [4, p. 3].
 The theoretical problems of ethno-geography and ethnography were referred to by S. I. Brooke, W.
I. Kozlov, V. I. Levin և others.
 In Russia in 2009 published by E. "Ethnogeography" of the Church [5, p. 6], and in 2005 A. Lobshanidze and others
"Ethnogeography and geography of religions" teaching manuals.
Now let's present a table in the universities of the Russian FederationTeaching methods of ethno-geographyprograms.
  Ethno-geography is taught mainly in the faculties of geography.
 Thus Kazan (Near Volga)The subject "Ethnography, Ethno-Geography" is taught in the "Hotel Business" department of the State Federal University.
  Table 2 shows that ethno-geography is taught in universitiesIt is accompanied by the geography of religion.
  The content of the courses, competencies, research methods are almost inseparablediffer.
Ethno-geography and ethnography in ArmeniaThey developed mainly Russian-Soviet ethno-geographicalin the school system.
  The first anthropological-ethno-geographical researches in our republic were carried out in the XIX century.in the second half սկզբ at the beginning of XX.
  The first with the problems of Armenian anthropologywas engaged in As. Altunyan (with Shantr) in 1882. և Making measurements in 1884, the results of which were published in 1907 by Dr. V. Minasyan.
 He tried to prove that the anthropological type of the population of the Armenian Highlands is close to the Alpine, and the Armenians are the descendants of the Hittites.are.
  J. referred to the ethno-geographical problems of Armenia.Alishan ("Shirak", "Ayrarat", "Sisakan" monographs), P. Abelyan said
("The population of Armenia in the pre-Soviet-Soviet regions"), St. Lisitsyan, G. Vantsyan, A. Haksthausen, S. Karapetyan,
V. Temurchyan, D. Vardumyan, A. Odabashyan և others.
 They are remarkable!Diaspora Armenian scientists V. Hatsuni, A. Alpoyajyan and others
investments.
Table 1:Ethno-geography taught in RF և RA universitiesteaching-methodological programsDuring the Soviet years, along with the collection of ethnographic and ethno-geographical materials, attention was paid to the reproduction of different nationalities living in our republic.
 Contribution to the development of Armenian Soviet ethnography and ethnographyhave as a senior (E. Lalayan, Kh. Samvelyan, S. Lisitsyan, St. Lisitsyan),as well as the representatives of the new generation (V. Bdoyan, K. Melik-Pashayan).
Huge ethnographic and ethno-geographical material is contained in various diaries and yearbooks published by Diaspora Armenian patriotic unions.
 Ethnographic and ethno-geographical studies are mainly carried out in ArmeniaIn the Institute of Archeology and Ethnography of the Academy of Sciences of the Armenian SSR in Armeniaat the Institute of History.
Ethno-geographical studies in newly independent Armenia are limited to the region of our republicwithin.
 It should be noted that the works refer to different periods.
 In this regard, we can mention the "Republic of Armenia" published by "Vostan" ethnocultural research institute of the Institute of Archeology and Ethnography of NAS RANational Minorities ”two-volume work by well-known ethnographer, public and state figure Yu. Edited by Mkrtumyan, H. Sargsyan "Population of Eastern Armenia XIX- started XXv." (2002).
Thus, ethno-geography as an independent scienceIt was formed in the node of ethnography, demography and population geography.
  Ethno-geographical studiesThe deepening led to the development of new directions, ethno-demography and ethnotoponomics.
 Ethno-geography is currently taught in many universities in Russia and in Armeniaonly in the chair of geography and teaching of Gyumri State Pedagogical Institute, Faculty of Natural Sciences and Geography.
 Based on the ethno-geographical, ethno-demographic processes taking place in the modern world, conditioned by themFrom geopolitical changes, we think it is necessaryEthno-geography will be taught in the universities of our republicin the faculties and departments of history and geography.
