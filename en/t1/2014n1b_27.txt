It is related to the physical, moral, military-patriotic education of the Armenian young generation, the education, health, upbringing and normal development of the orphaned generation that survived the genocide.
The aim of the work is to reflect on the means and means of physical education born in unusual conditionsmethods in the American orphanages of Alex Paul in 1920-1925.
We have set ourselves the task of using the archive materialsTo bring Vahan Cheraz's patriotic, orphan և coaching activityIn the American orphanages of Alex Paul, with which he got a new life and content of the daily life of the Kazakh orphanage.
Vahan Cheraz was born in Constantinople in 1886 and lived in Europein countries like England and France, but he was in love with Armenia.

   And it soon became clear to the Americans that a unique, incomparable, gifted person with his own views and principles had entered the orphanage, a new breath.հաղորդ gave life to the dead life in the orphanage.
 The situation of orphans who survived the genocide was presented by James Burton in his "Middle East"The history of the relief mission "/ 1915-1930 / in the book.
  He writes here that it is difficult for people living in civilized countriesImagine groups of thousands of children who never have a smile on their faceappear, և who do not want to play, it's just found childrenIt was the most unnatural and terrifying feature.
  Their dirty andIt was already painful to see the weak bodies and the tremors, butThe scene of children squeezing in groups, without a smile or anythinglack of interest in them, they were very pitiful.
 ChildrenThey did not cry or whine or ask for anything, they just sat motionless for days with a desperate expression on their face, without any interest in each other.
  All this testified to the complete absence of a normal childhood.
  This was the situation in the American orphanages of Alex Paul before Cheraz.
 A way out of this paralyzed stateThe question of finding was the biggest problem of the day, Վ Vahan Cheraz was invited, whoHe offered to find a solution by using "character-building" disciplinary mechanisms.
