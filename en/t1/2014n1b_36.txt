It is very good to be close to God.
And there is no other way to approach than to enlighten oneself with knowledge.
Gr. Magistros Pahlavuni Today, the reforms being carried out in the modern educational system and their results are constantly being exploited.
  Of course, it is very important to keep pace with modern requirements, not lagging behind the general pan-European programs, but in this case we value the purpose of teaching and learning - national education, which, by the way, has recently been neglected in some cases.
 It should be noted that since ancient times, Armenian intellectuals have been concerned about Armenian upbringing and the problems of national education.
Thus, for Grigor Magistros, the primary concern was "the rich Armenian Aramian school created by the efforts of many educational generations should never be forgotten, on the contrary, the torch of Armenian schooling should always remain bright at all times" (7, p. 263).
 Then, giving priority to the traditional Armenian upbringing for the future Armenian educational generations, the great scientist finds that the achievements of creative thought are stored there, which will become a solid foundation for the Armenian educational path in the right path of science (7, p. 291).
In this regard, we consider a great progress in our educational system to have a high-leaning high school, in this case the Trbanjyan Altar of Harichavank, which aims to educate and educate Armenian Christians, as well as to provide comprehensive and in-depth education to future clergy from the school level.
We will try to take our work in two directions. First, we will compare the modern և traditional, particularly the educational realities of the 10-15th centuries and the teaching methods related to Old Armenian.
 Moreover, we have chosen the mentioned centuries, taking into account the fact that since the 10th century, the Old Armenian language has ceased to be the language of communication of the society, constantly remaining the language of communication, God and man.
 With this in mind, the teaching of ancient Armenian had a clear purpose.
 As for the modern day, the teaching of Grabar in the schools is conditioned by the preservation of the traditional language of the church rite.
  In fact, from the 10th century onwards, one of the purposes of teaching Old Armenian, the literate conduct of the rite of piety, remains the same.
The second direction that we will follow is to compare the realities of teaching Grabar with the realities of teaching modern literary Eastern Armenian, which will be a prerequisite and support for students when studying Grabar.
Thus, the teaching in the altar is carried out in accordance with the programs of the high school humanitarian stream, including important subjects: teaching the Holy Bible, careful music, singing, history of the Armenian Church with a more in-depth program, Grabar, solfeggio.
  It is noteworthy that education here is organized and carried out according to the traditions inherited from the Middle Ages, of course, ignoring the realities of the modern educational system.
 By the way, by medieval or medieval, we do not mean backward, "dusted" traditions and methods, on the contrary, they are realities examined by time, which are still relevant today.
  Examining the experience of the famous teachers of the past, we consider it necessary to refer to it, especially since "they found a lot of work to be done both in our world and in a worthy memory."
  For example, the altar is a boarding school և free of charge.
  In medieval Armenia, access to education (especially elementary) was used. For example, Mkhitar Gosh (whom Smbat Gundstable agreed with) 1 states in the Judgment Book: "It is not obligatory to teach a hired child according to the rule" (14, pp. 76-77).
 And Smbat Gundstable, being more advanced, tried to regulate the education of vulnerable people by legal field, stimulating the flow of people seeking education. "The law commands the law to force the weak, to take care of them, to delay the work so that many will apply and come to hope" (14).
 By the way, the last reality, to apply and come to hope, is still relevant now, it is one of the priority problems of almost all schools.
Thus, the training was not elementary or arbitrary, but special work was done in this direction.
  First of all, let's start with the fact that state care for education was considered a priority 1 "The law commands that a monk is not paid at all for reading a book or studying in a church of other sciences, and it is not appropriate to take a fee and then teach."
 See Smbat Sparapet, Judgment Book, 76-77.
and sponsorship.
 For example, Gr. Pahlavuni, concerned about the fact that students were disappointed before school, wrote that the general development and education of the people would have been more retrospectively "regulated if the Armenian kings had approached this issue carefully and diligently." "For the pride of the Aramaean sex, and the indomitable nature, and the harshness of the harsh, I would not submit to such a continuing education, or, if not, to the state, to be honored and to cut my prudent craft into the ornamental chamber." ).
In order to further enhance the effectiveness of the study, Gr. Pahlavuni, as an in-depth pedagogue, hints in his papers about the age peculiarities of the students, according to which he changes his writing style, paying attention to the relative simplicity, accessibility and clarity of the material.
  Moreover, this is in the case when Pahlavuni was generally against affordable teaching, considering it worthy of the lazy (7, p. 320).
  By the way, the great scientist wrote a series of letters with eloquent cursing the lazy ones, such as "Towards a wise philosopher not directly" (DB), "Towards a pupil and proud student" (DZ), "Towards a psyche of hope" (DZ), etc.
The systematization of teaching with a simple to complex transition was not overlooked. For example, the first Armenian secular scholar, Grigor Magistros (990-1058), in a letter to his students Barsegh ղEghise (Paper XE), explained the so-called systematic system of study adopted in the Byzantine educational centers, which presupposed a four-level version of teaching.
 Thus, first of all, grammar was used with the presence of appropriate auxiliary translated literature, secondly, rhetoric with its three sections, thirdly, the limits of philosophy given in the works of Plato և Aristotle, and fourthly, Pythagorean geometry. "For it is a prerequisite to study the Grammar together with the translation in a sovereign manner, and to follow these three Rhetorical editions with an unmistakable division, and then to contain the Sahmanats, and the Platonic and Aristotelian and again the pious rhetoric" (7).
  But before all this, the student's foresight was used. The learner should be familiar with the Old և New Testaments, folklore, and ancient Greek literature, which were new requirements for the period (7, pp. 312, 322).
 In fact, in this case the necessity of obligatory foreknowledge was emphasized.
Using the European medieval educational system, G. The master has developed a new curriculum, taking the teaching to more complex than relatively easy-to-understand subjects, offering Bible teaching, mythology, samples of Greek mythology, arithmetic, music, geometry, astrology, grammar, philosophy, theology.
  Note that the thematic content of the subjects has not been blindly copied, has been revised periodically, changed as necessary.
In fact, "if grammar students in European schools were immediately taught grammar, then G. The master instructs them to teach this difficult, difficult course after learning more easy, easy subjects ”(17, p. 16).
Later, Hovhannes Imastaser (1047-1129) generalized և coordinated not only the curricular curriculum, but also the list of recommended literature, as he "enriched schooling and science with the method of examination of phenomena and realities, claiming that experience is unequivocal" (10). , which, of course, was a great progress.
One of the primary issues during the training was the issue of language accessibility, about which various, often contradictory opinions were expressed.
  For example, Gr. Pahlavuni was in favor of a complicated, threadbare language, which stemmed from his pedagogical views.
First, he considered that his words were addressed not to lazy and lazy, illiterate readers, but to scientists with the stamp of theoretical thinking, soaring in the air of infinity of ideas and views (7, p. 282).
 Like this writing style, he used to serve as a stimulus, trying to arouse interest in learning.
 "Certainly he did such a cunning style that the lazy ones would let go of their weakness and try to understand the Letter addressed to them, in which the genius of their teacher could be seen" (7, p. 285).
We consider it necessary to refer to such realities, which were the achievements of the Armenian intellectual pedagogues before the European one. For example, Gregory of Tatarstan (1346-1409), preceded by the British pedagogue, philosopher John Locke (1632 1704), noted that the soul of a child is born with a hard plate or washed parchment, whatever is written on it, they will take it.
At the same time, he did not ignore both hereditary, "natural" and acquired "gracious" features in the formation of a person.
 Enumerating the medieval pedagogical achievements, we can not ignore him. Tatatsi's suggestion: "Respect the child's self, be caring, kind, at the same time considered it superfluous to show too much tenderness or extreme strictness - to show care, care, love, intransigence, demandingness, consistency" (12).
Referring to our days, we should mention that for the effective teaching of Old Armenian, we first of all clarify the program of teaching Old Armenian, for which we consider the starting point of the program features of teaching modern literary Armenian in high school, without which it is impossible to imagine teaching Old Armenian.
We are more than convinced that in parallel with the modern Armenian language course, it is necessary to take the teaching of Old Armenian by creating program correspondence.
 Thus, the teaching of Old Armenian presupposes, first of all, a preliminary knowledge of the ևReading rules of the ancient Armenian phonetic system, and then a reference to the teaching of grammatical realities.
  In the high school of the modern Armenian language, it is planned to teach basic knowledge of ancient Armenian only in the 10th grade of the humanities stream: "Grabar writing and pronunciation", "Grabar two-dialects and three-dialects", "Grabar vocabulary" topics. pp. 10-16).
  In addition, according to the program, 34 hours per year are allocated for the teaching of orabar, one hour per week, and the teaching content is entrusted to the teacher, who, at his discretion, will compile the program due to his preferences.
  As for the gift, 4 hours a week are allocated here, the first two of which are provided for the presentation of the basic knowledge, the next two for the study, and the teaching is carried out with Petros Bediryan's textbook "Language Ancestors" (see 2).
In order to increase the efficiency of learning, we suggest combining Grabar և modern Armenian programs.
Thus, since there is no reference to grammatical material in the modern Armenian language curriculum of the 10th grade of high school, the program commonality of the modern "old Armenian" of this grade cannot be created. When teaching Grabar grammatical realities, one should rely on the knowledge gained in the lower grades.
 In fact, we can use this period to learn the grammatical order of the Old Armenian noun, the consonant and the consonant.
 And already in the first semester of the 11th grade, 24 hours () 1 is allocated for the repetition of the above-mentioned grammatical categories, which we can provide in parallel to reinforce the relevant Grabar realities.
  The same can be done when teaching the system of humility. Thus, in the second semester of the 11th grade, we suggest to refer to the system of conjugation of the old Armenian, and already from the second half of the first semester of the 11th grade to its repetition and consolidation, especially since 22 hours in the first semester and 10 hours in the second semester faceless, as well as welcoming the expression and expression.
 In the second semester of the 11th grade, we suggest referring to the adjective, year, and pronoun from the parts of the noun, for the repetition and strengthening of which, in the next 12th grade, the modern Armenian program provides 6 hours, and for the beginning of the 12th grade, we plan to teach macabre.
 As for the prepositions, considering the functional difficulty of the latter, we suggest to refer to their teaching throughout the course, starting from the 10th grade, passing each preposition separately, of course, reinforcing it with constant repetition.
  As for 1 Program Realities ենք We have taken the information about the time from the modern Armenian language curricula of Harichavank Altar.
They consider it more preferable to study them as a part of speech in the second half of the 12th grade, when the modern Armenian curriculum repeatedly refers to the word connection.
 Thus, let's present the above with a table. Table 1 Old Armenian modern. types, consonant, consonant, number verb, verb forms. Seasons tenses adjectives, year, pronoun, contact grade X I semester X II semester XI I semester. types, rhyme, rhyme, number. faceless forms, verbs and tenses. types, consonant, consonant, number (repetition) verb, verbs of the verb. tenses and tenses (repetition) XII I term XI II term adjective, year, pronoun, year, pronoun (repetition) macabre, preposition, preposition XII II Term: For the purpose of teaching Old Armenian և և problems, there are features that deserve attention.
 First of all, the fact that ancient Armenian is a dead literary language is suggested, but it does not serve as a means of communication for the society.
 In this case, the main purpose of teaching is to master the language, not as a means of communication, but as a means of conducting the church rite accurately, reading and understanding the texts.
In fact, if the transfer of knowledge about Grabar in the humanitarian stream of the high school is aimed at making the mastery of the modern Armenian language easier and more substantiated, then the leading goal in a careful altar is different.
To make Grabar teaching more meaningful, we suggest selecting practical texts from each class's Bible course և from the original music genres.
  Thus, in the 10th grade, the teaching of the Holy Bible begins with the Gospel. As a material for original reading և practical exercises, we suggest to take the relevant passage, the same ված related to careful singing.
  By the way, this methodical invention has been used since the 13th century. In order to make the teaching of grammatical material more grounded, Hovhannes Yerznkatsi, in writing his textbook, in addition to grammatical interpretations, also used books on history, rhetoric, grammar, philosophy and other sciences, creating interdisciplinary connection.
As now, in ancient times, no less attention was paid to teaching methods.
  Thus. "It is not enough just to have knowledge, it is necessary to know the way of teaching, otherwise it will work little or not" (9, p. 70).
Referring to the teaching methods, let us first mention that we use and evaluate both modern interactive and traditional methods, which we think would not be right to abandon.
  For example, T. Juharyan, not denying the greatness of innovation and the importance in the field of pedagogical development, noted. "Tradition, if not devoid of antiquity, is important for the advancement of science.
  True traditionalism also plays a great role in the development of methodological and pedagogical thought ”(17, p. 241).
      In this regard, it is necessary to decide which topic is more expedient, easier to teach, and in which case the study will have a deeper basis.
  Moreover, from ancient times the teaching has been carried out by various tricks և methods: lecture, individual work, questions, conversations-debates, competition, homework, homework, book work, discussion, etc., which are still relevant today, their role and importance in the modern educational system.
Thus, Isaiah Nchetsi, seeing the difficulty of the verb part, attached a table to his work "Analysis of Grammar".
  The method of the table suggested by Nchetsi is very effective today, for example, the conjugation of verbs according to the bases (note the simple tenses) can be presented in the form of a table. Table 2 Present Present Past Perfect Present Limit 1. present 2. past imperfectSclass I of the past Imperative1 .Conventional imperativeLimit 1. past perfectSclass II of the past Imperative 1. original (present) 2. The adverbial (tomorrow) table can be used to present the conjugation systems of Old Armenian և Modern Armenian, based on the method of comparison-comparison. Old ArmenianBoundary1.present2.perfect imperfect 3. past perfectDepartment I tomorrow, II tomorrowImperative1. original (present) 2. persuasive (tomorrow) 3. inhibitory imperative Table 3 Modern ArmenianBorder1.current2.perfect imperfect3.past perfect4. tomorrow 5. early past6.performer present.perfect past past tense (tomorrow, past) Hypothetical (tomorrow, past) Compulsory (tomorrow, past) Imperative 1. original (present) 2. imperative imperative The same can be done, for example, in the case of a year, a pronoun or any other part of speech.
As for the modern methods, we consider it effective to use the prism or grouping method in the promotion of Grabar, in the stage of understanding the meaning - the method called Venn diagram - system of interactive signs, and in the case of weighing - the cube method.
 As an example, let's talk about two of the above methods. The venigram is a combined teaching of two realities with similarities and differences, for example, comparing modern-Armenian-ancient Armenian realities while teaching clips, can be presented as follows: In the circles with a cross-sectional area in the center, we write in Old Armenian և Modern Armenian, then mark each of the specific features in the corresponding sections, after which we underline the generalities, for example (direct, transitive, plausible, exclusive, practical) Feature 6 homosexual, transitive, plausible direct, sexual, practical, intransitive) Armenian generalities of grabardard.
 In this regard, we consider it expedient to use the systematic method of interactive signs, which is more expedient to use in the perception of meaning.
  Thus, while reading the new material, the learner marks what he knows (V), news (+), contrary to what he knows (-), incomprehensible realities (?), Interesting (), questions to be discussed (!) With appropriate signs.
 For example, take the lesson XVI. "The Only Begotten of the Father…" The Only Begotten of the Father and the glorious light with him, voices were heard in the sandstone.
 Seeing the birth of the great patriarch Gregory, he told the king, who believed in joy.
 Let us build the holy tabernacle of light, because light has shone on us in Armenia (2, p. 54).

Summing up our material, let us mention that we agree with the point of view that the educational process is a constantly changing, evolving phenomenon that goes hand in hand with the demands of the time, requires a creative approach, it is impossible to give exceptional value to any method, ignoring others.
  Each specialist, according to the capacity of the audience, their experience and training, conducts the lesson, trying to give the highest possible results.
 After all, pedagogy should be concerned with the possibilities of effective teaching from the very beginning. Expert searches in this case are inevitable, even very necessary and recommended.
