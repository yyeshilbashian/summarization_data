GSPI organizes two-level university education with a bachelor's, master's, as well as postgraduate, postgraduate study program.
  Learning, interactive teaching, laboratory, practical, seminar, pedagogical-internships, essays, folders, testing and testing, individual, independent-research work are the most important of the many forms of teaching in the first degree.
One or two research assignments during the study, even in the absence of clear co-institute requirements, can not provide the necessary level of learning skills.
  Experience shows that the quality of research work in the master's level of education suffers significantly due to the lack of required skills.
  Therefore, we think that the issue of raising the level of readiness of students to do research work deserves attention.
In the undertaken work we try to suggest successive steps to solve the problem և to refer to the discussion of some of them.
 These are: • Development of criteria for the knowledge of different skills of the student to carry out research work, requirements and unit values ​​for their different levels of knowledge և Use to evaluate the work already done, Depending on the purpose, a test of knowledge through a questionnaire or test, • the use of assessment results to develop a subject program that teaches relevant skills;
           In our work we will not touch upon the analysis of the last two points մշակ the elaboration of requirements for different levels of criteria, but we will present a sample for one criterion.
We have chosen the final work from the research work carried out by the student during the university education.
  In addition to academic knowledge, different abilities and skills are required for the independent "successful implementation" of this work.
  Let's agree to call these skills criteria for student readiness and requirements ներկայացնել to present them in the following groups: • general literacy skills - RH, • research skills - RA, • technical skills - information technology - TC, • presentation skills - RH.
The latter are not checked by a test or questionnaire, they are revealed during the presentation of the work, they have a certain influence on the formation of the general grade.
After developing the requirements, we created a questionnaire to check the knowledge of those requirements, we suggested using it in different test methods, for example, by conducting a survey or testing.
During the survey, the learner will be required to give extensive answers to the questions, and during the test, select one or more of the suggested answers.
 Each of the test forms, depending on the purpose, has advantages and disadvantages.
 The survey results will give an idea of ​​the general level of student development, mastery of the mother tongue, the ability to construct a connected, logical speech, and analysis, so this test will be more appropriate, especially among students of the humanities.
 However, difficulties will arise because the answers are not technologically verifiable, can not be uniform, և a large role field will be created for subjective factors, will not ensure the objectivity of the assessment both when the examiner does not recognize the student and otherwise.
 And for testing, it is necessary to make each question of the questionnaire a test task, offering the learner one or several correct answers, prompting about it in the task.
 For the sake of simplicity, we have included only one correctly answered task in our test.
  The testing will ensure the technological nature of the test, but the objectivity of the assessment will again not be unambiguous, as such tasks increase the likelihood of randomness, as well as the level of language literacy, analytical skills, etc., which were the advantages of the survey.
The evaluation methods of the two test forms will be somewhat different.
  Each test task is graded 0 or unsatisfactory, with a specific positive score or excellent.
  If the test is to be done with a questionnaire, then different levels of requirements must be developed for the evaluation of each criterion (which we did not consider a problem in this work, but, for example, to clarify our logic, we present a sample of different skills requirements) with corresponding unit values.
  For example, in Table 1, the "Topic Selection" criterion score is 0-8 points.
  Claims with different unit values ​​may be conventionally as follows: The learner - had no idea that he / she would play a role in the choice of the topic - 0 points, - considered the choice of the topic only the supervisor's job - 1 point, - chose a very "beaten, tortured", non-novel topic - 2 points, - made a random choice of the leader - 2 points among the suggested topics (tried to show the ability to choose), - substantiated his choice from the topics suggested by the supervisor - 3 points (showed the ability to choose), - suggested a topic, but chosen at random - 4-5 points (depending on the importance of the topic). - substantiated the choice of the topic with the availability of the necessary literature - 6 points,
Applying this principle, the level of knowledge of the learner can be determined on the basis of the total unit value obtained from the assessment of all requirements.
  And the score scored by the learner in the assessment scale will be unsatisfactory, sufficient, good or excellent, it will be determined by a certain percentage in comparison with both the test and the total score of the questionnaire.
For example, • 0 - 39% - unsatisfactory • 40 - 69% - satisfactory • 70 - 89% - good • 90 - 100% - excellent This scale is conditional, because if you see the need to make a scale, each structure can develop a scale.
In both methods of testing, in addition to determining the total score, it is possible to separate the sums collected from different skills by determining the percentage value of each of them in relation to the maximum value for those skills, to get a clear picture of the level of proficiency of each skill.
Table 1 presents the names of the required skills, the criteria or requirements for their knowledge, the conventional comparative points, the results of their testing և Some questions of the work evaluation methodology.
  [3]
 In order not to increase our workload unnecessarily, we first offer a sample of "Test" for the purpose of testing, and by separating the questions of the test tasks, we will also receive the "Questionnaire" questionnaire.
 By the way, test discretors can be a guide for compiling questionnaire criteria (which we have already mentioned is not our problem).
If the requirements of the criterion are assessed with 0-1 points, then they will be considered as unsatisfactory-excellent levels, and if a range of points is suggested for assessment, then in order to assess the learner's knowledge with a specific score, as mentioned, there must be requirements with different values. Assessment scale to determine what level of knowledge a student's score provides is unsatisfactory, satisfactory, good or excellent.

In order to make the assessment of the weaknesses and strengths of the student's willingness to communicate in a certain language more visible, we have presented the results grouped by the skills, with their total points, by the assessment scale in Table 2.
Names of Research Preparation Skills / Requirements / ResearchStudy Skills- RA Technical Skills - IT Presentation Skills - FG General Literacy Skills - GC: Skills Numbers in Table 1-The Common Score of Each Skills: 4B7: Good: 7.7-9.79 Excellent: 9.9 -11 Satisfactory: 5.6-9.66Good: 9.8-12.46Excellent: 12.6-14 Satisfactory: 6-10.35Good: 10.5-13 , 35 Excellent: 13,5-15 In Table 2, the specific points for each type of skill were obtained by the sum of the maximum points for each skill requirement in Table 1.
 And the levels of knowledge of the interviewee's skills are determined by the percentage of the student's score compared to the maximum, according to the scale suggested in the work.
 For example, if instead of the maximum 60 points of all the requirements of the Republic of Armenia, the student scores 25 points, according to the scale proposed in the assessment methodology, it will make about 41.7% of the maximum, ie it will be considered a satisfactory grade.
After determining the skill units remaining on the same principle separately, a clear picture will be given of the level at which the respondent masters each of the required skills.
  And if it is necessary to express the initial level of knowledge by one point, then the sum of the points of all skills is done.
  For example, if the test taker received 25 from the RA, 6 from the TC, 6 from the GH, the average of all points would be 37 points, which would be considered an insufficient level of training.
As a result of the work, the performance skill unit will be added to the mentioned three skills, and the final grade will be formed.
The final evaluation of the completed work և presented in favor of the student can be used as an indicator for other circumstances, such as: • the number of literature sources used, • the relative number of recent publications, • the relevance of the content ցանկ literature list to the work, etc.
If another unit of assessment system is adopted in the institution, the units can be matched with the appropriate coefficient.
Adjustment of the level of knowledge, as already mentioned above, can be used to justify the need to include a subject that teaches relevant skills in the curriculum, and then to develop a syllabus.
In order not to increase the volume of work unnecessarily, instead of compiling a separate questionnaire - test, we present the sample of "Test" for the test, and by separating the questions of the test tasks, we will also get the "Questionnaire" questionnaire.
 By the way, test discretors can be a guide for compiling test criteria with a questionnaire (which we have already mentioned is not our problem).
 The number of questions assigned to each of the skills tested in the test is relatively proportional to the number of their requirements listed in the table, so regardless of the unit given the task (we conventionally chose 5 points), the specific weight of the skill will remain the same.
 The tasks for each skill are grouped by numbers, indicating the total points for the given skill.
