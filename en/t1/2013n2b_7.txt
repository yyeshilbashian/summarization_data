 In recent years, Armenology has referred only to the clarification of certain issues of its history, now the study of the complete history of Nakhichevan is gaining more political significance and importance.
 Occupying Azerbaijan, its history has been distorted with the greatest vigor during the last twenty years, where the Armenian cultural layer has been completely destroyed at the state level, Armenian traces have been erased from the pages of their "historiography" from the land that is an integral part of its homeland.
This article makes a small reference to the internal life of the Armenian Catholic community in the Nakhichevan region, which is of great value and interest.
  Thanks to the analysis of Armenian and foreign sources, the complete picture of the life of the Armenian community over a period of one and a half centuries has been revealed.
The Armenian Catholic community has played a major role in the political, economic and cultural life of the Nakhichevan region.
  In this article, we will examine the issues related to the origins, spread, development, decline of Catholicism in the region, the role of the Armenian Catholic community in the diplomatic relations between the East and the West.
Catholicism penetrated the territory of Nakhichevan at the beginning of the XIV century by the Franciscan-Benedictine religious people, who had spread propaganda in the Armenian villages of Tuman-e Nakhichevan * Azat-Tsirani and Darashamb մահ, are known in our bibliography.
 The Tuman-e Nakhichevan administrative unit included the provinces of Nakhchavan-Goght in the Vaspurakan province of Greater Armenia, Vayots Dzor, Chahuk, Yernjak and Tsghuk in Syunik.
  It bordered Yerevan vilayet to the northwest and Ghapanatiorot (province) to the east.
 The natural boundaries of the region crossed the Arpa River in the west, the Vardenis Range in the north, the Syunyats Range in the east, and the Araks River in the south [17, p. 303].
  Tuman-e Nakhichevan was divided into two large districts, Jugha and Shahapunik, whose main cities were Ordubad Nakhichevan [23, p. 362].
  These, in turn, were divided into mahallas, Jughan into Azat-Tsirani and Darashamb, Shahapunik into Daralagyaz mahal and Sisakan olka [12, pp. 47, 77].
 The Azat-Tsiran mahal spread in the basin of the Geghan River, including the provinces of Goght and Yernjak in the Vaspurakan and Syunik provinces of Greater Armenia, bordering the Syunik mountain range in the east.
 It was bordered on the west by Darashambimahal, from which it was divided by the Yernjak River, and included the provinces of Vaspurakan, Nakhchavan, and Chahuk, Syunik.
 Darashamb's mahal was spread in the Nakhijan river basin.
 It bordered the Yernjak River to the east, the Vayots Dzor Mountains to the north, the Arpa River to the west, and the Araks River to the south.
1318 The Archdiocese of the Eastern Provinces was established under the auspices of Pope John XXII of Rome, with the city of Sultania in Persia as its center [15, p. 1714].
 1330 The 12 monks gathered in Qrna (settlement of Nakhichevan), mostly from the disciples of Hovhannes Qrnetsi, decide not only to obey the Pope personally, but also to the people of their faith, to accept the creed of the Catholic Church.
 1350 The city of Nakhichevan became the seat of the Catholic episcopate, and a century later the episcopal center was moved from Sultaniye here [6, p. 200].
  XIV century In the middle of the 19th century, as a result of the active activities of Bartholomew theologian Bartholomew and Peter of Aragon, a number of Armenian Catholic or Unitarian communities were formed in the above-mentioned mahallas of Nakhichevan [19, p. 514-522], where Pope Innocent VI in 1356 A separate Catholic congregation was formed under the auspices of the head of the Dominican Covenant [1, p. 388].
  The activity of the Armenian Catholic community lasted for about four centuries, from XIV to XVIII centuries. half [2, page 80].
XVII century At the beginning of the 19th century, the Armenian Catholic community in the Nakhichevan region had a large population of ten functioning churches [3, p. 148].
 According to J. Alishan, the number of unitary Armenians in the above-mentioned regions reached 19 thousand.
 This population was located in 3 cities and 12 villages, making a total of 1830 houses [1, pp. 385-387].
 However, Alishan has a small mistake, which was repeated by some researchers who referred to the problem in this way.
  According to the 1601 decree of Azaria Friton, Archbishop of the Armenian Catholics of Nakhichevan. According to the report, there were about 1780 Armenian families or 19400 population living in the province, which were located in Nakhichevan region: Aparaner, Aprakunis, Qrna, Saltagh, Khoshkashen, Metssen, Gandzak, Shahapunik, Gharaghush, Tsghna և Harzuk Maku village.
    XVII century At the beginning of the 19th century, 193 Muslim families appeared in these settlements alongside the Armenian population [20, p. 416-449], whose ethnicity cannot be ascertained.
The role of the Armenian Catholic community in the Nakhichevan region increased especially in the 17th century.
 The focus of the Catholic Church on Nakhichevan was primarily due to the fact that trade transit routes passed through the region, with many of its settlements (Nakhichevan, Jugha, Agulis, Ordubad, H.P.)
 The Catholic Armenians of Nakhichevan were so interested in the Safavid interests that they needed the help of the Western European states and tried to fight against the Ottoman Empire with the help of those countries.
Subject to European mediation, Shah Ismail I (1502-1524) granted a number of privileges to the Armenian Catholics of the Nakhichevan region [7, p. 176].
 However, the privileges of the predecessors of the change of interests were losing their force և they needed to be reaffirmed.
  The old privileges were re-established during the reign of Shah Abbas (1587-1629) through the mediation of the Pope and the kings of Western Europe.
  Maintaining diplomatic ties with the Persian court provided a great opportunity for the Pope to establish patronage over the Armenian monarchs in Nakhichevan.
  Embassies from these countries often came to Isfahan.
  And they all carried letters of recommendation, in which the Pope, the monarchs of Western Europe, asked the patrons to protect and protect the Armenian Catholics of their religion [4, p. 317].
Thus, when the religious Paul Poghos Chittadin, appointed by Pope Paul V as a special delegate, accompanied by the Dominican, Augustine և Carmelite monks, in 1615 On December 13, 1945, he presented himself to Shah Abbas in the city of Fahrapat. The latter granted a number of privileges to the Catholic Armenians of the Nakhichevan region, in particular, children 's conventions were banned, confiscated property was returned
Attention to the Catholic Armenians of the Nakhichevan region has been growing since the first quarter of the 17th century, when Rome began to pay special attention to the Christians of the East, taking more serious steps to subdue them.
  1622 Pope Gregory XV founded a large religious institution in Rome called the Holy Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith.
 In Armenian Catholic literature, this congregation is called "Holy Assembly of Propaganda", "Holy Assembly of the Faith of Propagation" and "Holy Assembly of Faith".
 1627 Pope Urban VIII established a multilingual school in Nakhichevan to train Catholic preachers [15, p. 318].
 This school, opened to Catholic Armenians, was taught by a large number of religious people sent from the Vatican, one of whom was Poghos Piromali from the Dominican Church, who in 1632 was established in Armenia in 1654-1664. He was the Archbishop of Nakhichevan and ruled the Catholic Armenian community [15, p. 606].
  The latter was the clergyman through whom "Catholicos Philip of Etchmiadzin wrote to Inocentius of the Catholic faith, which was signed by the bishops and eight monks and sent by Paul to the Dominican Republic in Rome, pp. 17-17]."
1669 On the special instructions of Pope Clement IX, King Louis XIV of France, and the Grand Duke of Tuscany of Venice, Archbishop Matteos Hovhannisyan of Nakhichevan was sent to Isfahan to obtain privileges in favor of his Armenian Catholics [8, pp. 64-67].
  Thanks to those negotiations, the former privileges of the Armenian Catholics of the Nakhichevan region were re-established.
  In other words, the Armenian Catholic communities were declared "khas", recognized as "subordinate to the immediate interest, free from the authority of any private prince."
 This meant that the Catholic communities would henceforth be under the personal tutelage and patronage of the Shah; they would pay him taxes և directly or acquire the right of tax "immunity" [16, p. 385].
 These rights were acquired by the Armenian Catholics of the Nakhichevan region during the reign of Shah Abbas I, but the Persian officials ignored the interests, it was necessary to re-establish the privileges of the previous one with each new interest.
The relations between the Catholic Church and the Persian court became important in the 17th century. in the second half of the reign of King Louis XIV of France.
  It was at this time that the territory of Nakhichevan became a possible link between the Persian court and the political relations of the West, as there was an opportunity, it was the Catholic Armenians of Nakhichevan who were given the attention of the King of France [4, p. 323].
 Thus, in 1664 In his letter of February 7, 1914, Louis XIV hinted that Catholics, like other Christians, were subject to the law of Imam Jafar in Persia [22, p. 288-289], according to which every Christian, accepting Islam, took possession of the property of Christian relatives [5, pp. 219-221].
 Asking for the repeal of this law, the king hastened to add that he was referring only to the Christians who called themselves Franks (Catholic) and did not refer at all to the sectarians, ie non-Catholic Armenians [4, p. 323].
Despite numerous letters and appeals from the West, the situation of Catholic Armenians remained dire.
  1682 Father Peter, a Jesuit preacher who arrived in Persia on the instructions of Louis XIV on October 15, 1945, reported to Shah Suleiman (1666-1694) the concerns of the King of France over the continuing violence against the Catholic Armenians of Nakhichevan [18, p.262-263].
 If XVII c. There were 5-7 thousand Armenian Catholics in Nakhichevan in the middle of the 18th century. In the beginning, their number did not exceed a few dozen people [10, p. 9].
 The Catholic Armenians, who enjoyed the patronage of the Western European states and the Pope, lived in such difficult conditions.
  The reason for this was the unstable administrative system of Persia. The orders of interests either did not reach the local governors or were simply ignored by them, և naturally such foreign diplomatic interventions could not have any effect և prevent all the illegalities stemming from the rotten Persian state system.
Despite the patronage and tangible assistance of the popes of the Western European countries to the Catholic Armenians of the region, in the XVIII century. In the middle of the year their activity ceases.
Thousands of Armenian Catholic families from the Nakhichevan region emigrated to the Turkish territories of Asia Minor in 1746, particularly to Smyrna [1, pp. 406-407].
  Several communities of Catholic Armenians convert and convert to Islam.
 Lazarus Chahketsin writes about this. "Similarly, in the land of Nakhichevan Akhtarma, many beauties became converted to the Persian religion, such as Salitagh, Qrna, who translated Alpert into the abyss of madness," Ketsuk, Soka all of them, " , but in the geographical city of Chahkay, the Armenians did not become part of the Persian religion because of our united nation, which we have placed among them ”[9, p. 334].
 The Armenian population that converted to Catholicism, being cut off from its church, whose role was invaluable in the preservation of the Armenian identity, leaving its national culture, more easily became a victim of the policy of assimilation of the Muslim authorities [3, p. 151].
Thus, in the XVIII century. In the middle of the 19th century, due to the unstable administrative system due to heavy taxation, lack of security of life and property, and violation of dignity, some Catholic Armenians in the Nakhichevan region converted to Islam and others were deported.
 According to a report presented to the Diaspora, Armenian brothers were expelled from the villages of Krna և Aparanner "during the last beastly wars of Khulikhan (Nadir Shah1736-1747)" [13, p. 21].
 Ղ. According to Alishan, after those events, the Italian missionaries who visited Nakhichevan met only 60-70 Catholic Armenians [1, p. 387].
Conclusion. The պետ Pope's attention to the Catholic Armenians of the Nakhichevan region should have left a huge impression on the rest of the Armenians suffering from Persian-Turkish rule, as that attention was not real, but brought real benefits, of course, this in turn should have raised the hope that to achieve physical security through conversion.
 However, the Catholic Armenians did not have access to physical security, this is clearly evident in Armenia in the 17th century. One of the letters of the recent Jesuit missionaries, one of which reads: "... I can not remember without horror the difficult conditions in which the Armenian Catholics of Nakhichevan province lived among the Muslims ..." [21, p. 195].
 Nevertheless, the Armenian Catholic community, emerging as an independent, in-house unit, made a major contribution to Nakhichevan's international diplomatic relations between the West and the East, with the Pope and European monarchs on the one hand, and King Louis XIV of France on the other. in the diplomatic contacts between the Persian interests.
