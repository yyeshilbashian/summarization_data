 At the beginning of each year, the Government of the Republic of Armenia approves the distribution of funds allocated to the CBA program by the state budget of the given year according to the main directions and regions.
 In particular, in 2015, 82.7% of CBA programs were directed to family benefits, 13.0% to social benefits, and 4.3% to emergency financial assistance.
  The Minister of MLSI of the Republic of Armenia may, in the last quarter of the year, if necessary, redistribute financial resources according to family, social benefits and emergency assistance, within one percent of the total funds7.

The structure of financing the ECB program in 2015, percentage Thus, if in 2011 In December 2015, about 84,000 families received family benefits. The number of beneficiary families (receiving family or social benefits) in December was about 106300 8.

  One-time financial assistance was provided to families entitled to family benefits. 5181 families due to the birth of a child, 10903 families due to the admission of a child to the first grade, 170 families due to the death of a family member.
 And in 2016 During this period, 106,000 families were included in the Family Benefits System and, in fact, based on the direct methodology of insecurity assessment, determining the insecure families, funds are provided.
 About 80,000 families, which are mainly families with children, receive family benefits in the average amount of 31,350,000 drams.
  26,000 families are families with no children or only adults receiving social benefits10.
 In order for a family to be considered a beneficiary of a CIC program (to be included in a Family Benefit Scheme), a potentially vulnerable family must first apply to the BSEC.
  A social card (passport) is created for the given family and the family is registered in the system.
  A family insecurity unit is calculated for the family, the amount of which determines whether the family can receive benefits or not.
  The size of the insecurity unit can also affect the amount of benefits, as well as be decisive for using other state social services.
 Registered families can receive family benefits whose Family Insecurity Unit (POI) exceeds the threshold (currently 30.00).
 Family benefit is a regular (monthly), continuously paid benefit.
  Its size depends on the number of children in the family.
  It is determined by adding a supplement to the base amount of each child.
  Moreover, each Minister Artem Asatryan presented the 2016 The work done in the field of social protection, http.

 50 161 ECONOMICS The amount of the supplement per child varies for high mountainous and border areas, as well as according to the size of the IUU.
 The CBA program is the second largest program in the field of state social protection, after the Labor Pensions program.
  In 2015, 38.4 billion was allocated from the state budget for the implementation of the Central Bank program. AMD, and in 2016 - 38.4 billion. AMD.
  The latter makes up 9.5% of the social protection budget or 2.8% of the state budget.
  The funding volumes of the program have continuously increased during 2008-2016 by an average of 4.5% per year.
  The exception is 2011, when funding volumes were reduced by 6.1%.
  In 2011, the number of beneficiary families also decreased by more than 18%.
  In the following years, the number of beneficiaries increased, making about 105 thousand families in 201511.

  As a result of this system, more resources have reached the poor than they would have if no attempt at addressing had been made.
  That is, the system used is progressive.
  The progressive coefficient in the first quantile was about 2.75, which means that the poorest 20% received 2.7 times more resources from the budget of the FBI program than in case of non-application (random distribution) of the insecurity assessment system.
  However, the efficiency of the system is quite low, as 25-30% of the resources actually reach the non-poor upper 3 quantum groups (Figure 4).
 Figure 4. Distribution of BSEC Program Beneficiaries and Budget by Quantile Groups Both "inclusion error" and "non-inclusion error" are large in the system.
  This is evidenced by both the 2014 ILCS data and the EDRC 2015 IT survey data.
  If we consider all the poor as beneficiaries of the system, the non-inclusion error will be 73% (according to the ILCS - 79%).
  In other words, in 2015, 73% of the poor were not included in the system due to 163 ECONOMICS.
  The non-inclusion error for the very poor (including the extremely poor) is 63 percent (73 percent according to the ILCS) and only 56 percent for the extremely poor (69 percent according to the ILCS).
  Thus, at least 56% of the extremely poor do not use the ECB program12.
 It should be noted that the ECB program is of great importance in terms of poverty reduction in Armenia and support for families in difficult life situations. The absence of this program will lead to extremely negative socio-demographic as well as economic consequences.
  It meets policy priorities and strategic goals, the real needs of society and stakeholders.
  It is the most important tool for poverty reduction in Armenia.
  The CBM program is aimed at curbing poverty in the country, therefore, in unfavorable conditions of economic development, regardless of the fiscal situation, budget constraints and the availability of resources, the CBM program should be expanded.
  Therefore, the opposite statement is also true. In the case of optimistic scenarios of economic development, the ECB program should gradually lose its role.
  The demand for this budget program and its financing is inversely proportional to the socio-economic situation of the country and the budget opportunities.
  Another way to ease the pressure on the State Budget Program is to increase the efficiency of the system.
  As a result of the Central Bank program, about 105 thousand families or about 14% of all families in Armenia received financial assistance from the state.
 About 8,000 of them are families with children, about a quarter of which are families with 3 or more children.
 In order to reduce the above-mentioned violations of addressing, the following circumstance should be taken into account, if previously there were benefits for raising the living standard of the family. According to the actual place of residence, today they are included according to the registration address, but there are insecure families who do not even have a registration address.
  In other words, very needy families, who often find themselves abroad and do not have a place of residence, can not be automatically included in the CBA program.
  To address this issue, it is recommended that family's local Social Services case managers use home visits to find out where the project's potential family is located.
  To this end, it is necessary to increase the efficiency of the work of territorial bodies of social services and social assistance councils by introducing appropriate mechanisms and procedures, establish active cooperation with NGOs and international organizations, in addition to providing financial support under the program, holding regular social and psychological meetings with family members. .
  Expand the role of independent monitoring and evaluation in the CBA program.
  To make the implementation of the ECB program and the discussion of the results the subject of the society's greater attention.
  Establish mechanisms for the introduction of public oversight.
  Provide regular reports on the implementation and progress of the OIC program.
