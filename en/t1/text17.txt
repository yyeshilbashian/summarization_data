A regional approach is needed to assess the modern tendencies of the RA economy.
  Although in the last two decades certain preconditions have been created for the implementation of territorial economic policy in Armenia, various socio-economic development programs have been developed and implemented, nevertheless the disparities of territorial development continue to deepen and are mainly reflected in the growing economic role and significance of the capital.
 The asymmetry of the territorial development of the Republic of Armenia has been studied by two methods of multidimensional statistics: factor and cluster analysis.
  Factor analysis divides the array of variables under study into a small number of groups, that is, the unsystematic array of data is converted into several macro variables, which more systematically describe the different characteristics of the object under study.
  Cluster analysis also allows us to highlight the factors that unite statistically identical variables, but more often it is used to classify the observed objects into groups.
 The following indicators were selected for multidimensional analysis, the data of which are presented in Table 1: 1. Coefficient of mechanical increase of the population, ‰ (X 1), 2. Coefficient of demographic care,% (X 2), 3. Poverty rate,% (X 3), 4. Coefficient of employment of labor resources,% 217 ECONOMICS 5. Unemployment rate, % (X 5), 6. Share of economically active population in the total population,% (X 6), 7. Share of men in the total number of labor resources,% (X 7), 8. Gross regional product per capita, thousand . AMD (X 8), 9. average monthly nominal salary, ths. AMD 10. The volume of import per capita, ths. AMD (X 10).

 //armstatbank.am/pxweb/en/ArmStatBank/?rxid=002cc9e9-1bc8 It should be noted that the ITA was calculated according to the following principle [1, page 33]. First, RA 2015 Gross value added was subdivided into four main types of activities: industry, 218 ECONOMICS, agriculture, construction and services.
  Then, the regional structures of the value indicators of the above-mentioned branches were determined, on the basis of which the regional added values ​​of the four main types of activities were obtained (multiplying the added value of each branch by the regional share of the given branch).
  Moreover, certain deviations in the values ​​of the regions are possible due to the division of 21 types of economic activity into 4 large groups, as well as methodological differences between the sectoral value indicators of the product and the added values ​​of the types of activities.
 Factor and cluster analysis were performed using SPSS software package [2, pp. 40-76].
 Table 2 shows the initial statistics of factor analysis [3, p. 121].
 Table 2. Division of total variation 1.733 17.335 77.783 ECONOMICS Accordingly, three factors were selected for the analysis. The first explains 39.8% of the total dispersion, the second 23.9%, the third 14.0%, and the three factors together account for 77.8% of the total dispersion.
 The next step in interpreting the results of factor analysis is to look at the Rotated Component Matrix [3, p. 135].
  This table is the main result of factor analysis, which expresses the results of classifying variables by factors.
 As can be seen from Table 3, the 10 variables studied were classified according to three factors, moreover, the first can include 3, the second 4, and the third 3 variables.
 Table 3. Inverted Matrix of Components The first factor was called demographic because it included the male share of labor resources (0.818), the mechanical increase in population (0.788), and the variables characterizing demographic care (-0.699).
 220 ECONOMICS The second factor is called social because it includes employment, unemployment, the share of the economically active population in the total population, and the level of poverty.
 The third factor bearing the economic name includes three variables: gross regional output per capita (0.929), average monthly nominal wage (0.909) and imports per capita (0.589).
 The data of Table 3 show that the largest impact on the social development of the RA regions is left by the employment of the population in the economy, the correlation coefficient of which is 0.894 with a factor of 2, the second is the unemployment rate with a correlation coefficient of -0.809.
  The third variable, the poverty level, is also inversely related to the latter: -0.760.
  From this we can conclude that the social situation of the RA regions, first of all, has a good effect on the high level of employment, which leads to low unemployment and, more importantly, low poverty.
  Moreover, these variables assessing the social situation ultimately determine the emergence and development of the most sensitive process of the current demographic situation - the intensity of emigration and, as a direct consequence, the decline in the share of men in the structure of the population, especially labor resources.
  It means that the intensity of emigration is high in the regions where the level of employment of the population is low, therefore, the levels of poverty and unemployment are high.
 The values ​​of the factors by regions are presented in Table 4, the data of which show that Yerevan is the leader by all factors, moreover, the difference between the regions and the capital by the "economic" factor is more than obvious.
 According to the observed index, Yerevan is followed by Syunik and Kotayk marzes.
  Shirak and Kotayk marzes are the leaders after Yerevan in terms of "social" factor.
 221 ECONOMICS Table 4. Eigenvalues ​​of factors by RA marzes and c. Yerevan Marzes Factor 1 Factor 2 Factor 3 Yerevan 1,575 1,286 2,155 Aragatsotn -0.613 -1.375 -1.067 Ararat -0.044 -0.665 0.637 Armavir 0.076 -0.092 0.422 Gegharkunik 0.989 -0.401 -1.108 Lori 0.870 0.18 -1.0909321 Syunik -1.498 -0.567 1.644 Vayots Dzor -0.169 -1.442 -0.214 Tavush-0.340 0.148 0.160 Factor analysis allows grouping the regions of Armenia according to separate factors, but this method does not implement all the factors taken together.
  The advantage of cluster analysis is that it enables to classify not only the studied variables, but also the observed objects, according to any number of factors or variables [4, p. 6].
 Figure 1 presents the dendrogram characterizing the order of cluster connection, which shows the pronounced asymmetry of the socio-economic development of the RA regions.
  First, the RA marzes were subdivided into two clusters, Yerevan and other marzes, then the marzes, in their turn, were divided into three clusters, moreover, the distance between the formation of two and four clusters is very big, almost 25 out of 7.5 on a scale.
 222 ECONOMICS Figure 1. Dendrogram of the classification of RA regions.
 The first cluster includes the city of Yerevan, where the per capita GDP is the maximum in 4 clusters - 1678 thousand. AMD.
  In this cluster, the volume of per capita imports and the average nominal monthly wage are also high, but the unemployment rate is also high.
 The second and third clusters are characterized by the average level of GDP per capita (1246.3 and 1199.5 thousand drams, respectively).
 The second cluster includes 4 regions: Lori, Kotayk, Aragatsotn, Syunik, and the third cluster includes the regions of Ararat and Vayots Dzor, where the values ​​of the observed variables are almost average compared to the corresponding indicators of clusters I and IV.
 The fourth cluster includes the regions of Shirak, Armavir, Gegharkunik, Tavush, which are in a deplorable state, first of all due to the economic factor.
  The average indicator of GDP per capita in this cluster is the minimum 223 ECONOMICS compared to other clusters (982.5 thousand drams), the amount of average monthly salary is also low.
 Thus, factor and cluster analyzes made it possible to make a multidimensional classification of the regions of the Republic of Armenia and to study the complex impact of some factors on the asymmetry of territorial development.
