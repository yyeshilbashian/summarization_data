Shirak region, particularly the regional center Gyumri, due to its geographical location, unique natural resources, rich historical and cultural values, was considered one of the major centers of tourism in Armenia.
 It was known throughout the Soviet Union.
Tourists were arriving in Gyumri մարզ Shirak region from many cities of Armenia և USSR.
  Tourism experienced a particularly great development in the 70s and 80s of the 20th century, when the number of tourists visiting Gyumri reached more than 20,000 people a year (this does not include the number of unregistered tourists).
  During that time, a well-developed tourist service infrastructure was established in the city.
 4 all-union և numerous contractual special tours passed through the territory of Shirak արզ through Gyumri.
Great demand routes.
  In those years he enjoyed culture in 1988. After the earthquake, tourism in Gyumri had a significant decline.
At present, a rather high rate of development is observed in the sphere of tourism both in the region and in the region.
 Given this fact, it is necessary to do some research in the field of city և regional hotel service, as the latter is an important infrastructural component of this branch.
In general, the level of tourism development is one of the main indicators of the tourism quantitative characteristics sold in the area [1, p. 211].
Quality of services և Our research aimed to reveal the specificity of two important factors in Gyumri and Shirak region.
  The first of them is the quantitative description of the flow of tourists, and the second is the level of development of the tourist infrastructure.
According to the data of January 2020, for Gyumri և Shirakimarz, 23 hotels և 39 guest houses are registered on the "Booking" platform, serving the tourists, providing the necessary services for that [3].
  Thus, at present it is possible to receive more than 1000 tourists in Gyumri at the same time, which is more than 5 times more than in 2006.
In other settlements of the region, particularly in Artik, the "hotels in Maralik" guest houses, in fact, have no tourism significance.
  There are small guest houses in the Amasia region, which receive tourists visiting "Lake Arpi" National Park, and only during the summer months.
This indicator is interesting. According to the same "Booking" platform, the number of private houses with daily rent in Gyumri during the year had reached 130, while in 2019. Their number did not exceed 30.
If such a high rate of development continues, Gyumri և Shirak region may become one of the major tourism regions of Armenia.

  Moreover, tourists visited Gyumri and Shirak mainly in June-October (80%).
During the remaining 7 months, the hotels ատ guest houses will be underloaded.
 It should be noted that the working period is calculated to be no less than 90 days to ensure the profitability of tourism infrastructure [2, p. 67].
Another important question: the analysis of the days spent by tourists revealed that 90% of the tourists who arrived in Gyumri stayed in the city for one day, spending the night in one of the hotels there.
is in Gyumri.
  Obviously, it can be stated that Gyumri is considered a transit city for tourist destinations from Georgia to Yerevan.
  They mostly spend the night here to continue their journey in the morning, although our inquiries revealed that about half of the other groups had already booked an excursion program.
Summarizing the analysis, it can be said that tourism in Gyumri and Shirak region is characterized as a dynamically developing branch.
Based on the above-mentioned indicators Comparing the hotel complex in Gyumri with other cities in Armenia, it becomes obvious that at present it is far behind only the capital.
There are now more than 700 hotels in Armenia.
Reservation hotels, of which about 500 hotels are included in the Armenian hotel reservation website Hotelium.am [4], only 191 [5] in the Bar Armenia website, and 461 hotels, 15 hostels, 27 motels, 25 "B & Bs" are registered in the Armenian "Spyur" directory. 6].
in the system471, registered in Yerevan [3].
In order to assess the level of development of the tourist complex, we have made calculations on tours.
 The calculations were made according to the following formula: Day = F Ժ Ժ, where: is the number of tourists (person / day), number of tourists (person), Ժ average - the average number of days of tourists in the region.
In order to make a comparative analysis, indicators of three regions were calculated, moreover, relatively well-developed regions from Shirak region were selected in terms of tourism.
 It was considered expedient to compare the indices of Shirak, Lori and Tavush marzes.
The difficulty of such calculations is that there is no complete data on tourists visiting the regions.
  The data we used for the calculations are estimates submitted by the regional administrations.
Table 2. Tourist calculation dataNumber of tourists (person) Average number of days of tourists (days).
Tour number (person / day) Region 1 ShirakLoriTavushAccording to the calculations, the highest number of tourists was registered in Tavush region, which is due to the well-developed tourism infrastructure, as well as the opportunities for multi-day tours.
There has been a sharp increase in the number of tourists visiting the Shirak region, which is conditioned by the predominance of one-day tours.
  Unlike Shirak region, the number of tourists in Lori does not exceed 18 thousand, which is only 30% of the number of tourists visiting Shirak region, but in terms of tourism Lori is almost equal to Shirak region (54 thousand people / day), which is the number of tourists in Shirak region. 90%.
The mentioned analysis allows to say that despite the sharp increase in the number of tourists in Shirak marz, the number of tourists is low, due to which the hotel complex, as well as the catering facilities work in seasonally congested mode.
As it was mentioned, the number of hotels operating in Gyumri exceeds 20, so we can say that only about 3% of the hotels operating in Armenia are located in Gyumri.
  There are no four- or five-star hotels in Gyumri.
  Some of the existing hotels are classified as "Three Plus" star hotels (video table 1).
Therefore, the "all inclusive" system can be very important in increasing the hotel occupancy and number of travelers.
  Many tourists prefer to visit hotels that offer three meals a day.
  Such hotels are considered an excellent option for mass tourists.
  A similar service is provided in Gyumri.
Hotels only offer breakfast.
An increase in the number of animation services has a decisive effect on increasing the efficiency of hotels, from the comfort of the hotel room overnight, to the availability of entertainment after meals.
  For this reason, animation plays one of the main roles in hotels, which is closely connected with other spheres և has a certain significance.
In the work of tourists.
The purpose of the animation service is the constant contact of the vacationers, the result of which depends on the quality of the tourist's rest.
  The workload of the hotel may depend on the quality of the animations.
Animation services are especially suitable for tourists relaxing with children.
The hotel will attract tourists by providing a wide range of services, including the presence of a swimming pool, fitness center, spa center, beauty salon, doctor's room in the efficiency of hotels.
have a positive effectFigure 1.
  Location of hotels և Some tourist facilities in the city ԳIn the case of Gyumri, the hotels will offer custom animation services.
  In order to organize animation in local hotels, it is possible to consider the presence of swimming pools.
  Animation services can be offered in Gyumri by "Araks", "Vanatur" and "Yerazank" hotels.
  "Vanatur" և "Araks" hotels offer a Finnish bath (sauna), banquet hall, business meeting hall, cafe, restaurant.
"Yerazank" hotel has an outdoor swimming pool and a sauna.
From the hotel-hotel brand name.
  Over time, hotel owners have come to the conclusion that if they depend on one location for demand, they may have demand elsewhere.
  That is, they can become a standard that is in demand all over the world.
In general, it is comparable to the efficiency of the tourist economies and the flow of tourists.
to say that the hotel direct increaseConclusions Based on the research work can be concluded.1. The infrastructure in Shirak is very unevenly distributed, which is a serious obstacle to tourism development.
tourist 2. In the conditions of a sharp increase in the number of tourists, the number of tourists is small, as a result of which the hotel complex of the region becomes less profitable.
3. High quality of animation services with strict seasonality of tourism infrastructures, particularly hotels.
Low efficiency due to Recommendations Recommendations The efficiency of hotels in Gyumri depends not only on quality but also on pricing policy.
The higher the price of the hotel room, the less it becomes available for mass tourism.
  During the inter-season period, the discount system does not work in all hotels.
  In order to ensure congestion in hotels, it is necessary to reduce the prices of rooms by reasonable percentages during non-season months.
  The season in Gyumri includes April-October.
  Then, from November to April, you need many festivals, events, lower prices, offer unique trips.
It is necessary to find new, competitive tourist destinations, to ensure the effective use and preservation of historical and cultural resources, and to commercialize them, as well as to develop winter and sports tourism.
  Gyumri և Shirak region have all the natural opportunities to restore and develop the sanatorium and eco-tourism.
