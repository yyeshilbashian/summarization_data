  The influence of financial institutions on the development of the economy has made the study of the issue one of the most important directions of economic research.
 The efficiency of each country's economy directly depends on its financesthe level of development of the system.
  Due to this circumstance, almost all those who have passed liberal economic relationsThe main direction of change in the countries became the creation of financial intermediation institutions and their activitiesDevelopment of mechanisms to ensure efficiency.
 Financial:One of the most important factors in the development of the system is the regulation and control of the financial system.
  Developing financialThe world is facing new risks, the prevention of which և keeping financial systems free from possible crises largely depends on effective regulation և control.
 Settlement:նոր New mechanisms are being developed to increase the effectiveness of control.
 Naturally, such a process beganin the Republic of Armenia.
  However, objective և subjectiveDue to various reasons of the nature, the system formed in the republic today does not yet have the requirements of a market economysatisfactory level of development.
  The main goal of the state policy for the development of the financial market is the effective regulation of the financial market.
 When financial?If market regulation is maintained at a proper level, then investors will be aware of the stability and economic benefits of their investments.
 In such a case, the crisis and the risks are more evenly distributed in the economy.
 Financial system activitiesDepending on the specifics, three models of financial market regulation are distinguished in international practice.1. For each segment of the financial market, control is exercised by a separate body.
 This model is used in the USA, Spain, Cyprus, Portugal, Finland, Romania, Lithuania, Luxembourg, and partially in Italy.
With the help of this version of financial market regulation a lotIt is easy to effectively regulate certain segments of the financial market based on the specifics of their activities, but it is not always possible to reach an agreement between all bodies.
 Some European countries in the last ten years,such as Belgium, Slovakia, Poland, have rejected this modelfrom application.
2. According to the other model of control over the financial market regulation, the corresponding responsibilities are divided between the two authorities.
 This variant is used in Canada and the Netherlands.
3. Concentration of financial market regulation functions onein the hands of the body - a mega-regulator.
  The model is used in Germany,In Denmark, Estonia, Malta, Austria, Switzerland, Japan, as well as, since 2006, the Central Bank of Armeniais a mega-regulator of financial stabilityresponsible [4].

 The main motives for the transition to a unified settlement model in those countries were financialthe need for effective control over institutions, the effect of scale, financial crises.
  In some countries of Eastern Europe և in the former USSR, the transition to a common financial regulation system took place later, in the 1990s. second
starting from the middle.
  The need for the latter was due to the marketwith sufficient effective control of the new financial intermediaries created as a result of the transformation.
 According to the World Bankaccording to 1999-2011 Financial market regulation systems of 106 countries were studied during the year, թիվը the number of countries
in which different segments of the financial market (banking system,insurance market, securities market) the responsibility for exercising control is vested in one body, has grown to become13 to 36.
 At the same time, the number of countries with one body has increasedCarries out the control of different segments of the financial market (banks և insurance companies, banks և investmentfoundations, insurance companies (investment funds), increasing from 20 to 25 [3].
Ensuring financial stability is one of the priority tasks of the central banks of a number of countries.
 This is due to itDue to the fact that low inflation, unemployment rate, high economic growth as problems of other monetary and state bodies,in modern economies can not be provided without the mediation of a developed և stable financial system.
By studying the various settlement models, one can:It should be noted that they work very well in different financial markets and countries with a political structure.
  It is absolutely impossible to confirm that the same model is the only unspoken truth of all countriesfor.
 We can single out a number of advantages of the unified financial market regulation system (mega-regulator).1. It enables more effective assessment of "preventing the distribution of risks across different sectors of the financial sector";Assess the impact of real, potential shocks on the financial market2. The mega-regulator can develop a more effective risk policy, affecting individual entities as a wholewhich are not part of it, as well as to develop appropriate approaches to monitoring financial services;3. The existence of a mega-regulator leads to regulatory bodiesactivity agreement, allows to avoidfrom the backup of control functions,4. Use of common approaches, methods and methods;enables the provision of unified information5. Increases the responsibility of the regulator when making decisions; 6. Provides savings of state funds, consolidation of human resources, cooperation, reduction of financial reporting.
It must be understood that there is one unified body of controlmay expand its activities to a certain extent, after which it is necessary to seek an opportunity to delegate powers.
  In the case of a unified regulation and control of the financial market, it is sometimes difficult to find a balance between the various goals of the settlement. "
  By setting goals, one regulator may not have a clear ideaվերաբերյալ rational leader, giving an adequate distinction between different institutions և.
  Improve responsibilityinstead, it may be reduced because it is difficult to work out one common denominatorcontrol over a number of issues.
 In many cases, different goals can lead to conflict.
  In the case of a joint regulatory body և a controlling monopoly is in fact established;which can give rise to so-called monopoliesinefficiency, which implies due to poor managementincrease in average costs.
  And in the case of monopoly control, it is no moreis more flexible և bureaucratic than in the case of individual specialized control.
Another problem is the constant increase in the functions of the joint body, which can occur when many politicians demand that the body perform functions thatdeviate from the main, from the main.
 For example, in some Scandinavian countries, a joint body is required to control real estate brokers, although this is not their main function, and in the UKThe joint regulatory body controls the pledges։ Promoting competition in the financial services industry.
The tasks and objectives set by the Joint Regulatory Authority should be clearly defined by the legislature, as follows:it is important to determine their relative priorities,so that the efficiency of the mega-regulator does not decrease.
The regulation of different segments of the financial market must be harmonious in order for the scale effect to work in the economy.
"Some researchers think it's a competition."financial market regulators, as one regulator may unreasonably tighten regulatory procedures.
 Otherwise, certain precedents are set in international practiceantitrust regulation of this body.
In case of problems, each financial institution expects appropriate assistance from the financial market regulator.
 It turns out that in the case of a megaculator, there is a riskis one body.
The financial system of the Republic of Armenia is also not free from various risks,which differ in their peculiarities from the risks in the financial systems of the developed countries of the world, taking into account the peculiarities of the transition economy, particularly our economy.
  On the way to the establishment of the financial system, the republic has faced a number of problems, one of which is:Most of them need to be settled.
 The financial system of our country is still in the process of formation.
 Although in the republicThere is an established և developing banking system, but financialThe rest of the system is still in its infancy.
 In other words, in this context, the financial system needs to be regulatedshould lead to the development of the latter.
In the conditions of the banking, insurance, securities market development, improvement of the payment and settlement system, the policy of ensuring the stability of the RA financial system, the Central Bank must continue the reforms aimed at the regulation and improvement of control.
 To be definedare the main goals of crisis management policyprinciples, such as the scope of cooperation between individual units involved in the crisis management process and public awareness approaches.
Unified regulation and control system in the Republic of ArmeniaThe preconditions for the creation were:1. The need to reduce risks in the financial system;2. Dissemination of best practices;3. Activation of underdeveloped market segments;4. Equal requirements for all participants in the systemdefinition,5. Reduction of regulatory and control costs;6. Facilitate the elimination of differences in the developmental levels of other participants.
As a result of the study of financial market regulation models, it can be said that the introduction of a unified system for the current financial systems is considered a regulatory ևThe best model of control as due to the introduction of the systemIt is possible to reduce financial risks, strengthen financial onescooperation of market participants, increase financiallevel of market development, create equal and free competition conditions for financial market participants, ensurereliability and security of investments, efficient use of administrative resources.
The efficiency of each country's economy directly depends on the level of development of its financial system.
  The main goal of the state policy for the development of the financial market is the effective regulation of the financial market.
 Examining the various models of settlement, it can be especially noted that they work very well in different financial markets and countries with a political structure.
  Many countries in the world are currently regulating the financial marketտեսնում They see the solution of the problems of the control system through the introduction of a unified system of regulation of the financial system, taking into account its advantages.
