Karen (Gerasim) Sargis Mikaelyan (April 27, 1883 - December 13, 1941) was one of the unjustifiably repressed intellectuals during the years of individual worship.
 The 12 stories that make it up are taken from previous collections.
 Many of his works are reprinted, and many are still unpublished (the politically persecuted novel When I Was Crazy (1927), the collection of short stories Immortality (1941)).
  Very little has been said about the prose writer in the literature, and his works have hardly been studied.
  Mikaelyan was well acquainted with the literary contributions of his predecessors, from which he inherited the concise, concise narrative style, the precise, unambiguous, simple word.
His lyrical stories ("Winter Evening", "Erfurt Program", "War of Vardanants", "Sakulikhumb", "The First Sorrow", "Long Live the Winners", "Revenge", etc.) are especially remarkable, where next to the magnificent images of nature The parallels of human mental experiences are presented: love, hate, disappointment, emotion and nostalgia.
  The poetic breath in Mikaelyan's works, the relentless sadness without unnecessary convulsions, the unspoken reality hidden in the more said, as well as the unusual charm of daily indifference, carefully hidden in the ordinary, which are the writer's talent, delicate spirit and lyrical-philosophical philism.
K. is interesting and attractive. Mikaelyan's writing style.
 It inspires sincerity.
  It sometimes takes place through a conversation, a listener, a dialogue, sometimes through a recollection or disguised by the author, as if from the point of view of a third person.
  Each of these forms has its appeal, it corresponds to the chosen topic, making it accessible, making it clear and honest.
  Tragedy is always inseparable from human society, but its realization is in the different heroes created by Mikaelyan.
  The question of life is hidden in it, without which there would be no contradictions, so life would cease to exist.
  A number of stories depict the life of city dwellers, the domination of money, the daily struggle against the unjust world, where everything is foreign to the honest human soul, և human inhumanity leads to destruction.
 In the story "The Baker Simon" it is that dumb indifference that instills evil and hatred in the one who fails.
  He went to the city in search of easy money and security, moved his family, but not enduring the new conditions, his wife and children died and died.
 Convinced that the city was to blame, he went elsewhere և trying to adapt to fate, he lived without complaining.
  At the sunset of his life, when he was sick, hungry and helpless, he found himself mistaken, thinking that "not everyone in my world will be happy, then even my world will not be a world" [1, p. 20].
  Perhaps Simon would have remained convinced of this if the indifference of those around him had not changed his attitude toward life and destiny.
  Everyone thought that "fate was like that".
  "Tomorrow he will fall and die," և without compassion and regret, full and safe people will say. "Why did he die? He could not live, he died," because not everyone can live.
  Throughout his life, the kind, meek, and humble baker becomes a rebellious man, dying out of indifference and contempt before his death.
  The author tries to emphasize indifference, finding that the greatest evils in the world are born from them.
  People should be kind to each other, especially the elderly and the sick, who need it more.
Such complex psychological feelings are presented in almost all of Mikayelyan's stories.
  His heroes think more, think, grieve over the heavy feelings of their memories ("Revenge", "Hekazbajin", "War of Vardanants", "Winter Evening", etc.), than act, do something.
The life of the porter Vartan goes in a different way.
  He was dissatisfied. "We do not own our lives as much as a dog or a cat" [6, p. 43].
 He opposes the blows of life, does not agree with what his friend said, "Maybe this is our destiny?"
 Being ahead of the baker Simon, Vartan finds his place in life.
The task of the literature of the time was to portray the new man, the individual who knew the rights.
  Mikaelyan has a number of works, the heroes of which are those transformed people.
  Being an active public figure, he was well aware of the difficulties of creating a Soviet country, he was almost convinced that he would open a fresh, painful groove in the fate of the Armenian people.
  The tragic past of the miserable homeland, the difficult present and the uncertain future become the signals on the basis of which the works on the theme of the homeland are born ("Map of Armenia", "Independent Armenia", "Tell them not to forget the Old Armenian", "Allways", "On the shores of peace", "Fig under the shadow "," The Illuminator "և etc.).
The prose writer could not pass by the Armenian tragedy, deportation, indifferently.
  He represents Armenians living on foreign shores, who live physically, but there is emptiness in their souls.
The tragedy of the past, desolating their souls, is like a ghost at every step.
  Mikaelyan presents the mental hardships of the lost people as Armenians on foreign shores and sometimes the seemingly carefree nightmare without undue joy, with all the misery and gloom.
  Many of the heroes are alienated Armenians who do not suffer much from the pain of losing their historical homeland.
 Some even shy away from being Armenian, trying to be as far away from the homeland as possible.
  The Shushi hero of the story "Arakel" does not return to his homeland after being wounded in the war, because, as he says. "Have I lost my donkey, or will my head be crushed?" [5, p. 55].
  The factory-owning hero of the "Internationalist" story goes further in his patriotic ideas. "Forget that I am Armenian" [4, p. 56].
 He is so happy to be at war in Armenia that he will not have to participate in the organized fundraising for the poor.
  The sister of the hero of the "Allways" story (the latter somehow escaped the massacres with her two daughters, losing her husband and two children), still loyal to their roots, is concerned about the fate of Armenia and the Armenians.
There are young people next to them, many of whom do not know Armenian. They are indifferent to Armenia.
  The hero of the story expresses his pain. "Do you know what a foundry America is?"
  What Abdul Hamid and the "successors" could not do through persecution and massacre, they will do without imprisonment and a drop of blood "[4, p. 82].
  The heroes of the stories "Evula" and "Retreat" are the alienating generations of Diaspora Armenians who are Armenians by etiquette, memories of the past, then they have nothing in common with the real type of Armenian in their way of thinking and behavior, so in the future they are nothing for the Armenian homeland.
  They are the last drops of water heated in the sandpit, for which the author lives a great life.
  The root of this tragedy is the deportation of Armenians, which, although not depicted, is a direct consequence of this way of life for generations.
Former socialist Arsen Rostomyan ("Retreat") is incapable of working, has no trade, has survived at the expense of ideological "friends", when he loses hope of receiving money from them, it becomes meaningless to live.
  It is half a step from a weak criminal to a murderer.
  "Squeezing the soft neck of a woman by the thick nails of the boots" [6, p. 72] seems to be trying to stifle her past "soft" life and empty, meaningless self-existence.
The hero of the "Evula" story lives only with a bold philosophy. "This world is the square of Ghochagh [" [1, page 29].
 He pursues the drunks in the cafe, robs them and leaves carelessly.
Some of those living on foreign shores longed for the strengthening and development of Armenia ("On the shores of the Pacific", "The murky waters of the Mississippi River", "Map of Armenia", etc.).
  In the story "IndependentArmenia" the compatriots are so proud of the newly created independence of Armenia that the American journalist notes: "If we have a state and a state budget, then you can pay your debts, what your former government did in America" ​​[4, p. 33].
Some of Mikaelyan's characters have a unique attitude towards the Armenian-Turkish relations and the future of Armenia in general ("At the Hour of Trial", "Independent Armenia", "Map of Armenia").
 The heroes of the story "At the Hour of Trial" express disagreements about the Armenian-Turkish massacres.
  One of the heroes starts from the slogan "the Turk should become gold, do not put it in your pocket" and calls to fight against the Turks and take revenge. "It must be massacred երով For decades they sucked our blood, they squeezed our bones.
  If you tear the stomach of their seven-year-old grandfather, Armenian bread and Armenian blood will come out… Now I am faithful to the contribution of their grandfathers, they continue the work they started, it is enough how long we have endured.
  We must unite as human beings and respond to them with what they do ”[1, p. 52].
  And the young teacher thinks that they should be friends, not kill each other, because "the Armenians suffered, the Turks from those constant battles.
 At the dictation of time, Mikaelyan expresses Bolshevik ideas, so being afraid to say his own word, he presents the idea of ​​revenge against the Turks through the mouth of a hero.
In the short story "Map of Armenia" in the Armenian newspaper published in America, once again seeing the map of Armenia from sea to sea, he is indignant. "Such foolish maps only mislead us and irritate our neighbors" [4, p. 27].
  The author urges to live in the present, not to manipulate the past.
 BC Through the existing sea of ​​Armenia, which is a myth, unfortunately, Armenians are more excited than small but real Armenia.
In his stories, the prose writer also referred to backwardness, traditional way of life, customs with all their charm and sometimes destructive consequences ("Uncle's wedding", "Hekaz bajin", "Mahak-Tuman", etc.).
 Karen Mikaelyan's works, bearing the deep stamp of time, on the one hand, depict the difficult state of Armenian labor, the emergence and political persecution of a new man, on the other hand, the alienating debts of the Diaspora, the supreme desire of the Armenian to have a strong homeland.
