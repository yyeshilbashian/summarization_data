The position of the problem.
  Atmospheric precipitation is one of the main climatic elements, which are the main source of land moisture.
  They determine the water regime of the given area, water balance, intra-internal distribution of river flow, determine the yield of agricultural crops.
  On the other hand, as a rule, atmospheric precipitation is classified as one of the meteorological elements, which are more typical of the local features of the spatio-temporal distribution.
 Therefore, especially in the context of global climate change, the knowledge of the spatial distribution of precipitation, change, the creation of an effective management system is very difficult.
Taking into account the above-mentioned, as well as the excessive precipitation and the importance of planning the management of irrigation of agricultural crops in the waterlogged area of ​​Ararat concave, efficient regulation and regulation of water resources, we aim to discuss the management of the important agricultural region of the republic, the Ararat valley.
  To this end, the following issues have been proposed և solved: 1) collect ել process the results of actual observations of atmospheric precipitation under study, 2) identify, analyze և assess the patterns of precipitation change dynamics in the region առանձնահատ spatial features, 3) identify արդյունավետ the use of atmospheric precipitation in the region և Ways to prevent the negative consequences of change.
The study area is a ridge-physicographic-geographical region surrounded by mountain ranges, at a depth of 2.5-3.0 km, with its unique natural processes and water-heating regime.
 Within the concavity there are 4 physical-geographical sub-regions: Ararat plain, Geghama plateau-western slope, Kotayk-Yeghvard plateaus, southern slope of Aragats [3].
Material և methodology.
  Relevant studies, publications, decisions of the Government of the Republic of Armenia, reports, development programs, projects, work plans, national reports served as a theoretical and informational basis for the solution of the set problems.
 The data of multi-year factual observations of atmospheric precipitation of the meteorological stations of the Hydrometeorological Service of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the studied area (1935-2014), as well as climatic bulletins [2] were used as a starting point.
  The results of the observations, both in the form of observation booklets, worksheets, yearbooks, as well as in digital versions, are stored in the main warehouse of the Hydromet service.
In general, many researchers have studied the atmospheric precipitation in the territory of the republic [4-11].
However, so far, as a comprehensive, comprehensive work in the form of a monograph, G.A. By Alexandryan in 1971 [8]
 In this work the author discusses in detail և presents the factors of annual, seasonal և monthly precipitation within the territory of the republic և և patterns of spatial distribution, reveals և analyzes the features of their regime depending on the difficult terrain և circulation conditions.
 However, it should be noted that precipitation studies are almost absent in the area of ​​the Ararat concave.
  Thus, the synoptic features of the formation of thunderstorms զ massive precipitation in the Ararat Valley were analyzed by A.S. Torosyan և G.H. By Surenyan (AS Torosyan, GH Surenyan, 2006).
Instrumental observations of atmospheric precipitation have been carried out in the studied area since 1885 (Yerevan "Erebuni", Yerevan "Lyceum").
  However, continuous և systematic observations have been made only since the mid-1930s.
The maximum number of observations (about 60 meteorological stations և observation points) was made in the first half of the 60s of the 20th century.
At present (2016) there are 14 meteorological stations in that area - 3 observation points (Table 1).
 It should be noted that in terms of meteorological observations, the region is one of the middle appropriated areas of the republic.
Moreover, 3 of the meteorological stations (Aragats b / l, Amberd - Anonymous l-tsq) are located at an altitude of about 2000 m above sea level.
 However, in the range of altitudes 2150-3200 m, there are no meteorological observations, which may have a negative impact on the results of climate studies.
 Therefore, it is necessary to fill that gap by restoring the stations that used to operate at those heights or by operating new ones.
As a methodological basis, geographical, mathematical-statistical, export, comparison, comparison, analysis, correlation methods were used in the work.
Results և discussion.
  The issues of change of atmospheric precipitation were discussed in the work և were studied according to the results of actual observations of individual aeronautical stations both by descriptive months (January-July) and by age segments.
 Taking into account the climatic peculiarities of the region կիրառ the practical significance of precipitation, the latter has been discussed separately for warm or vegetation (IV-X), hot (VIIVIII), cold (XI-III), water-rich (IV-VI) regions.
Salt. Figure 1 summarizes the actual average values ​​of the atmospheric precipitation instrument monitoring observations of the meteorological stations of the study area, according to the separated time periods.

 As a result of the studies, it was found out that in the region, in terms of both annual and characteristic months (I, VII) and characteristic periods (IV-X, XI-III, VII-VIII, IV-VI), there is no regular change in the amount of precipitation.
However, it can be said that the amount of precipitation decreases annually in the studied area, and the number of hot and hot seasons of the year increases during the warm season.
  As for the dynamics of the change in the amount of precipitation in January-July, it should be noted that in this case it is not possible to single out a more or less clearly expressed regular change according to meteorological stations.
 Different tendencies of change in the amount of atmospheric precipitation are observed in different meteorological stations, that is, both decreasing and increasing tendencies.
Therefore, in our opinion, the issues of revealing the patterns, economic assessment and management of the change of precipitation changes in the Ararat concavity should be discussed not on a monthly basis, but on an annual basis.
Fig. Figure 1 shows the dynamics of change in atmospheric precipitation for the Yerevan "agro" meteorological station.
It is true that in the region, up to 1600 m, there is a tendency to increase the amount of precipitation in hot and humid regions of the year, as well as during the rainy season.
 However, this does not mean that the problems of humidification and artificial irrigation for that concave area are being solved.
 The reason is that during those times of the year there is a significant loss of precipitation due to high evaporation, surface roughness կողմից vegetation with precipitation.
  On the other hand, the river flow in the territory of the Republic of Armenia is mainly formed at altitudes of more than 1800 m, and in that zone there is only a tendency of decreasing the amount of precipitation.

YearsNk. 1. Dynamics of change in atmospheric precipitation at the "agro" meteorological station Therefore, in the region it is necessary to develop a system for managing the dynamics of change in the dynamics of change of atmospheric precipitation as a climatic resource, which is back to the above.
  Above all, it is necessary to properly manage և use the water resources obtained from atmospheric precipitation.
 In other words, it is necessary to store the water of temporary, permanent small streams in the highlands, especially during the water-rich season, in order to use it for irrigation later (during the dry season of the year), as it is necessary to accumulate solid precipitation during the cold season.
Thus, as a result of such a change in atmospheric precipitation, the balance of the natural ecosystem will be disturbed, in particular, aridization of climatic conditions, soil degradation, violation of biodiversity.
  Therefore, it is necessary to assess precipitation change with an ecosystem approach, according to individual physical-geographical regions or river basins, to develop appropriate programs for mitigation and adaptation measures, taking into account the local specifics of any area.
It should be noted that despite the numerous works carried out to assess the change of atmospheric precipitation in the territory of the republic, there are still many unresolved problems and omissions in that sphere, which require great efforts and financial investments.
  Therefore, it is expedient to continue the systematic and complex studies of the change of the territories of the republic, ensuring the ecosystem approach և to develop their further forecasts, applying new models.
Conclusions և Recommendations.
As a result of the studies, we have come to the following conclusions and recommendations:  The amount of precipitation naturally increases from the lowlands of the depression to the southern slopes of Aragats.
  The maximum annual amount of precipitation, including in the republic, is observed at Aragats b / l meteorological station (988 mm), the minimum amount (166 mm) at Taronik meteorological observation point; mainly up to 1200 altitudes. At the altitudes of 1300-2000 m their number is only 2.
  And in the range of 2150-3200 m altitude there are no endodontic observations;  up to 1600 m altitude there is a tendency of increasing the number of annual precipitation, vegetation, hot և water-rich seasons, the number of cold season of the year decreasing
  From 1600 m, there is only a tendency to decrease the amount of precipitation;  no regular change in the amount of precipitation in January-July according to meteorological stations is observed in the studied area. Different tendencies of change in the amount of precipitation are observed in different meteorological stations; Նման In the conditions of maintaining such a trend of precipitation change, there will probably be an increase in the climate of the region, intensive land degradation.
It is necessary to: համակարգ ensure the continuity of complex ուսումնասիր systematic և comprehensive scientific research, introduce new programs and technologies;  ensure the homogeneity, continuity և reliability of the series of observations; Համակարգի Improving the information system;  Assessing the vulnerability of ecosystems due to changes in precipitation;  Conservation of solid precipitation; ուտ Accumulation; Implementation of legal-organizational, institutional, technical measures; ապահով ensuring the training process as national;
