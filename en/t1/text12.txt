Economists have long been interested in the issues of economic and cultural cooperation in key areas of human society.
  At the beginning of the new millennium, the prevailing idea in economic thinking is that economy and culture are a chain of interactions due to complex dialectical contradictions.
  And nowadays it is difficult to ignore the importance of cultural capital in the economic progress of the country, social developments and the solution of urgent socio-economic problems facing the society in general.
  It is more interesting and current to look at the cultural sphere from the point of view of the spiritual and moral values ​​and "behavior" formed by people from the consumption of cultural goods and services, which has a direct impact on the development of the economic environment and human civilization in general.
  Simply unlike the production sphere, the sphere of culture is a predominantly non-material, spiritual sphere of production.
  The results of cultural activities satisfy not only the material, but mainly the intellectual, aesthetic and spiritual needs of people, because for any thinking person these values ​​are no less important than the material ones.
 [1] Progressive cultural values ​​become the companions of innovation and economic success in society.
  In this context, the impact of cultural capital on economic performance is indisputable, and as Mark Casson notes, "The economy learns to come to terms with culture."
  [2] Finally, state thinking based on cultural values ​​ensures the implementation of the country's strategic goals, the establishment of justice and common moral principles in society and, most importantly, the harmonization of interests in the given economic environment.
  It is appropriate to mention Xuan Juan Michael Xiao's approach to this issue: "Cultural factors should not be interpreted as individual social behavior, but rather should be seen as a regulated, institutionalized cultural education complex at the community level."
  [3] Only at this level, according to him, can cultural behavior be combined with economic activity.
  On the way to the development of human civilization, culture gradually obeys the rules of the market game and turns into capital, an exclusive and multifaceted capital, which includes: Ամբողջ The set of beliefs, customs, traditions that reflect this stage of human civilization, which are passed down from generation to generation, influencing and influencing economic thinking.  Cultural heritage,  Social values ​​/ trust, corruption /,  Wealth / GDP per capita , national wealth /, ելի Knowledge,  Education.
 Of course, the enumeration can be continued, but the purpose of the article is to analyze one of the forms of cultural capital, the objective (materialized) form, and to evaluate its transformation into other forms of cultural capital, incorporate and institutional.
  The study of sources related to the problem [4] already proves the difficulty of cultural capital as a multifaceted factor, the impossibility of developing a single, common criterion for its evaluation.
 Within the framework of the statistics in accordance with the methodology of cultural capital assessment, a number of partial indicators are calculated, which characterize the activities of separate organizations (libraries, museums, theaters, cinemas, etc.) in the field of culture 2 14 ECONOMICS.
 Library activity is characterized by both absolute and relative indicators.
  Absolute indicators are the number of libraries, the library fund (million copies), the total number of readers (thousand people), attendance, the rate (served literature, million copies).
  The relative indicators of library activity are the intensity indicators, such as: library stock per 1000 people (for example), library stock per library (for example), library stock per reader (for example), number of readers per library (person), volume one per reader (reading per reader, for example), average attendance per reader, average book circulation.
 From the data presented in Table 1, it can be seen that the main indicators characterizing the activity of libraries in the Republic of Armenia have had decreasing tendencies.
  2001-2015 The number of libraries has been reduced by 21 per year, from 1131 to 830.
  Contrary to such changes in the number of libraries, the change in the library fund was insignificant or almost unchanged.
  In 2001, the library fund amounted to 19.7 million. for example, and in 2015 - 19.1 million. for example.
 Decreasing trends were registered in the number of readers, literature served (attendance) and attendance.
 During the mentioned period, the number of passers-by decreased by 16.44 thousand people a year on average, the attendance by 269.52 thousand, the fee by 0.34 million. for example.
  Such changes in the indicators have left their impact on the change in the relative indicators.
 As a result of the reduction of the number of libraries in the studied years, and the fact that the library fund remained almost unchanged, the library fund per library increased by 5.6 thousand copies in 2015 as compared to 2011, and it increased by 1187.7 copies per 1000 inhabitants.

  In 2015, compared to 2001, the number of readers per library decreased by 41 people to 611 people, and the volume per reader decreased from 19.5 copies to 19.1 copies (Table 2).
  The analyzes have shown that in 2001-2015. The number of attendees decreased faster than the number of readers, of which 144 ECONOMICS readings in the reader's library), as a result of which the average annual attendance per reader decreased from 11.7 in 2001 to 9.6 in 2015.
  The mentioned changes also affected the book turnover index. In 2001, the average circulation of one book was 0.7, and in 2015 this figure decreased to 0.5.

 Figure 1 [6] Dynamics of the number of students in RA universities in 2001-2015, thousand people From the data presented in Figure 1, it can be seen that the number of students in RA universities has increased in general, compared to 2001: 19.0 thousand people or 28.9%.
 Although, in 2001-2015. The maximum level of the number of students in universities was registered in 2009 - 114.6 thousand students.
  20092015 The number of students in RA universities has decreased by an average of 6000 or 14.1% annually.
 The number of employees involved in scientific research in the Republic of Armenia also had a decreasing tendency during the studied years, despite the increase registered in some years.
 146 ECONOMICS Figure 2 [7] Dynamics of the number of employees of the organizations conducting scientific research and development in the Republic of Armenia in 2001-2015, the figure shown in Figure 2 shows that in 2007, compared to 2001, the number of employees in research decreased by 18.6% to 2009. it increased to 6960.0 people.
  2009-2015 The number of people engaged in scientific research was reduced by 1182 people and made 5044 people.
 During the study period, the dynamics of the number of students in the RA universities and the employees of the organizations conducting scientific research and development had their impact on the changes in the number of library readers and the number of attendances.
 To find out the interaction of the mentioned indicators, we built three-dimensional regression models, where: x 1 t - number of students in RA universities in the t year, thousand people (factor feature) 147 ECONOMICS x 2 t - number of employees of organizations conducting scientific research and development in Armenia t- in year 1, person (factor attribute), y 1 t - number of readers in libraries in year t, thousand people (output attribute), y 2 t - number of libraries attendance in year t, thousand (output attribute), y ˆ 1 t and y ˆ 2 t - are the theoretical levels of the output properties in year t, calculated using constructed regression models, a 0; a 1; a 2 and b 0; b 1; b 2 - the parameters of the corresponding regression models are:
 The table presents the results of the regression analysis.
 Table 3 Results of the regression analysis of the number of readers and attendance of RA libraries Indicators Model appearance Multiple correlation coefficient Multiple determination factor According to the number of readers of RA libraries According to the number of attendance of RA libraries 148 ECONOMICS Significant Model
 The results of the analysis presented in Table 3 show that in parallel with the increase in the number of students in RA universities by 1000 people during the study period, in other equal conditions, the number of library readers decreased by 1.29 thousand people (a   1.29), and attendance quantity by 22.48 thousand (b 1   22. 48).
 2001-2015 The number of visits to RA libraries, the number of readers and the number of employees of RA scientific research and development organizations had decreasing tendencies, their development proceeded in the same direction.
 According to the built-in regression models, in parallel with the reduction of the number of employees of scientific research and development organizations in the Republic of Armenia, the number of readers of RA libraries decreased by 0.077 thousand people or 77 people, and the number of attendances - by 1.29 thousand or 1290.
 The connection between the selected factor and result attributes is strong.
 The calculated coefficients of determination show that about 66.7% of the fluctuations in the number of readers of RA libraries in the study period and about 73.3% of the fluctuations in the number of attendances of RA libraries are conditioned by the joint fluctuation of the number of students in RA universities and the number of employees. .
 In addition to estimating the significance of the model, it is necessary to evaluate the significance of the regression coefficients of the regression model.
  In our research, the number of 149 ECONOMICS employees of the organizations conducting scientific research and development in the Republic of Armenia has a significant impact on both the number of readers of the RA libraries and the number of visitors to the RA libraries.
  The parameters of this factor feature can be considered significant in both models.
 According to the results of the analysis, the number of students in RA universities does not have a significant impact on the number of readers in RA libraries, this parameter can be considered insignificant, but it has a significant impact on the number of libraries, in the second model we can consider this factor significant.
  All this allows us to conclude that a part of the students in the RA universities become users of library services, therefore the reduction of the number of students directly affects not the change of the number of readers, but the change of the number of attendances.
 It is obvious that the number of users of library services is also conditioned by the development of new technologies, particularly the level of access to Internet services.
  Since 2009, the NSSRA has been publishing data on the population of the Republic of Armenia on access to Internet services.
 Figure 3 [9] Number of Internet access subscribers in Armenia in 2009-2015 2015 ECONOMICS As can be seen from the data presented in Figure 3, in 2015, compared to 2009, the number of Internet access subscribers increased about 1.79 times, from 1227.5 thousand to 2199.8 thousand subscribers.
 Two regression models were constructed to investigate the effect of the number of readers of RA libraries (y 1) and the number of visitors to libraries (y 2) on the number of Internet access subscribers (xt): in case of the number of readers of RA libraries, in case of number of visitors to RA libraries, in both cases The connection between them is inverse and strong.
  According to the built-in regression models, the increase in the number of Internet access subscribers by 1000 in the studied period, but on equal terms, reduces the number of readers of RA libraries by 0.088 thousand people or 88 people, and the number of visits to RA libraries by 1.247 thousand.
  From the results of the analysis it can be concluded that the increase in the number of Internet subscribers has expanded the possibilities of using online libraries, which have also reduced the number of library readers and attendance.
 Thus, one of the criteria for assessing cultural capital is the library activity, which is mainly conditioned by the activities in the field of education and science, therefore the number of library readers and attendance mainly depends on the number of students in educational institutions, researchers in science and in practice these relationships tend to decrease.
  Moreover, the number of users of library services today is also conditioned by the development of new technologies, in particular the level of access to Internet services, which certainly has its impact on the above processes.
