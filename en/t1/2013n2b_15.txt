Landscape studies is one of the directions of regional geography, which studies natural spatial complexes - landscapes, their morphology.
  Recognition of the patterns of development of the dynamics of interrelationships between the features of landscape units is closely related to natural environmental features, so field (scientific-stationary) methods play an important role in landscape research.
Landscape laboratory classes are one of the important links in the general complex preparation of students.
 During landscaping laboratory classes, the student works with a topographic map, and the skills to work with the latter, to use the information contained in it purposefully, is one of the most mandatory skills of a geographer, particularly a landscape scholar.
 Without it, it is impossible to deal with landscape mapping, especially the analysis of the relationship between landscape components.
The main purpose of this methodological article is to show the necessity of laboratory-practical work և to offer examples of laboratory work in parallel with the theoretical course on landscape science.
  Using the starting materials, students should be able to independently create landscape profiles, textual, graphic, tabular legends of maps, large-scale landscape maps.
It can also be a task to reinforce the knowledge gained by students during previous lectures, workshops, internships, to achieve a free reading of the relief depicted by them horizontally.
Theoretical issues of landscaping are covered in the lecture of the course "Landscape", after which the student, regardless of his narrow specialization, should be able to read not only general geographical but also thematic maps - geological, geological, terrestrial, botanical, etc. [6].
 They must correctly explain the rich information of landscape maps.
Such knowledge is not an end in itself; their reinforcement is carried out against the background of the analysis of the features of natural spatial complexes (BTS) in connection with the lithological composition of the relief or the strength of surface sediments, changes in the geological conditions and surface flow regime.
  In the same climate, tectonic structure, in the same ancient geographical past, the above-mentioned changes on a small area of ​​a certain landscape take place mainly in the soil cover, which in one way or another has its effect on the redistribution of moisture and heat.
  In fact, when performing the tasks, the patterns of change of natural features from the highest to the lowest points in the BTC series should be outlined.
In the practice of landscape surveys, such works have to be encountered in the preparatory phase of field surveys, when preparing preliminary landscape maps, when topographic maps reveal the genealogical elements of complex natural spatial complexes or habitat types of plant habitats.
The following tasks are performed during laboratory exercises [4]. 1. In the delineation of special borders on a cartographic basis, presenting the relief horizontally, drawing different types of natural maps.
2. Preliminary landscape decoding of aerial photographs նախ Preliminary typological description of natural regional complexes.
3. Large-scale landscaping planning (marking of the list of դիտ routes of observation, development of landscape surveys on the given surface).
4. Analysis of geological structures of landscapes with landscape maps and aerial photographs.
  Defining the features of the methodology for the study of landscapes of different types of morphological structure.
5. Compilation of a large-scale landscape map with the materials of complex field studies, systematization of geological parts of landscapes, typology, compilation of a legend.
6. Preparation of special և applied maps based on landscape map.
Since each of the lessons includes to a large or small extent the questions that need to be understood during the performance of further topics, the students should pass the completed task on the eve of the next task.
At the beginning of the laboratory work, students are given excerpts from maps, on which the relief is marked horizontally (drawing area is about 4 cm2, scale is 1.
10,000, rarely 1.
25,000 or 1.
5000, horizontal crossing, mostly every 1 m, sometimes 2.5 և 0.5 m).
 They are also needed. methodical instructions for conducting other manuals, specific types of training, b. Large-scale topographic map with subsoil exploration points և results, c. edaphic network of plant species, d. Large-scale aerial photographs և space photographs.
When preparing for laboratory work, students are given a list of necessary literature.
The regional selection of maps for educational purposes should mainly be done in such a way that the maps include a part of the landscape area where the students are practicing, or their typical landscapes, for example, the students of the geography department of Gyumri Pedagogical Institute do their national internships. In the area of ​​the park ("Gorshaberd" gorge, located on the Akhuryan river, the shoreline of Lake Arpi, etc.), which is considered to be a suitable area selected for laboratory work.
It is possible that the morphological structure of the landscape is relatively simple, with no more than 10-12 species of faeces.
  Such a choice allows students to apply their first field experience ժամանակ knowledge in pattern analysis.
  In addition, this eliminates unnecessary technical difficulties when making maps.
The observation points are made on the educational maps, for which the full name of the subsoil is mentioned in the working legend, that is, the genealogical name, its mechanical structure տը the soil that forms the subsoil.
  It should be noted that many features of natural land complexes are not accidental, which are revealed by the characteristics of the subsoil, which in their structure և features include various natural processes and phenomena that act as subsoil factors.
Thus, to complete the task, there is some information on the relief (map horizontals), the lithological composition of the surface sediments, the strength (description of the soil-forming rocks in the legend), the humidity, the general lines of the flow mode (map ություններով with the differences in soil types), the differences between the soil types. , washing, peculiarities of the activity of Greek processes) About ևyln.
Relying on these basics, the student should be able to work on his or her own to create a series of plant communities that correspond to existing ecotopes.
  This requires information on forest, subforest, grass cover, main land cover types, ecology, for example, Gorshaberd site requires natural reed forest (about 57 ha), post-forest, Akhuryan left valley artificial forest shrubs (common forest shrubs) Information on the plants common in the forest formations of Akhuryan gorge (Sosnovsky osprey, Balanca doronik, Persian gas, Akhuryan currant, Karsi boxwood, etc.) [3].
    To help students, plant-based schematic generalized ecological series, forest tables, and literary sources are provided.
In order to complete the idea of ​​what the different forms of the terrain look like on the map, sub-point guides are used, albums of sample landscapes on topographic maps, "topography" subject reference books, exact characteristics of the surface slope.
The laboratory work is carried out in the following order: compiling a map, developing a legend, analyzing the content, discovering the patterns of natural differentiation of landscape development processes, and compiling an explanation.
We present several laboratory works that can be carried out in the conditions of the Republic of Armenia. Laboratory work N 1 Topic - Compilation of lithogenic base map of the landscape 1.
