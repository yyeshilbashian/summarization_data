The last quarter of the 20th century and the first years of the 21st century were years of new historical developments and changes for the Armenian people.
  In parallel with the world developments, the difficult events taking place in the Armenian people were conditioned by the struggle of the people who lost their statehood centuries ago for the right to regain their independence, which began on February 88 with the Karabakh movement.
The heroic struggle of our freedom-loving people was crowned with the victory in May, but the war that started, in fact, is not over yet.
The Artsakh movement had pan-Armenian-national scales ", of course, as it should have found its response in fiction in all historical periods.
 Dozens of journalists, publicists, and writers who went to the battlefield addressed the topic, and a large-scale literature was created, which was the real response to the topic.
We are convinced that the literature created on this topic deserves attention և examination as a reference to social-political life, also as a phenomenon in literature in general.
 Literary articles about this literature are either few or non-existent.
The article is an attempt to discover and evaluate the Armenian fiction depicting the Artsakh liberation war.
Back in 2004, Szak Arzumanyan wrote in his study "Modern Armenian Novel". "The Armenian artistic movement of the last decade has perceived and expressed these significant revolutions with sensitive breathing, trying to include what happened, losses and achievements in parallel with the socio-historical process" [1, p. 6].
During these years, valuable works were created, which deserve serious attention.
 A number of writers, such as Leon Khechoyan, Susanna Harutyunyan, Hovik Vardumyan, Hovhannes Yeranyan, Manuk Mnatsakanyan, Samvel Beglaryan, Mkrtich Sargsyan, Ara Nazaretyan, Hrachya Saribekyan, Norayr Adalyan, created only Another artistic description of the Artsakh liberation war or what happened on the battlefield is the socio-political life of the time, the socio-economic situation of the country, human rights and, in general, the war and post-war life in Armenia, which we consider necessary to refer to in the article.
More than 20 years have passed since the Artsakh liberation war, an extensive literature has been created.
 We are convinced that the literature created on this topic deserves attention և examination as a reflection of social-political life, also as a phenomenon in literature in general.
The literature created on this topic is not only a documentary-aesthetic perception of the material, but also contains a broad political context, sharp impulses of the way of life and bio-philosophy of the time, includes a wide field of heroes, their activities, gives answers to many questions and gives birth to new questions.
No matter how much they claim that today's writer does not create "good" literature, we do not have high-value works continuing the contributions of the past, nevertheless, when it comes to literature on the Artsakh liberation war, it becomes quite clear that many modern writers are heroes of the century and faithful novelists. They have created, indeed, high literature.
In almost all works, the actions take place in the context of Artsakh events.
  The authors do not shy away from speaking in the language of art, including the inexperience of statesmen, sometimes incomprehensible actions (Samvel Beglaryan, "Sunset at dawn"), the difficulties of life in the "dark and cold years" Hovhannes Yeranyan, "Armistice") or analyze the current situation with descriptions of the internal political situation and draw conclusions between Artsakh and Armenia at war (Vardan Drikyan, "The Unstarted and Unfinished War"), give the man in the terrible clashes of the war the character (Mkrtich Sargsyan, "The Armenian of the End of the Century")To convey the "war taste" to the reader and to complete the military story with small but eloquent stories (Ara Nazaretyan, "Strategic Stories").
In the vast majority of the examined cases, the authors use autobiographical facts, presenting with diary accuracy the situation on the battlefield at that moment and the mental state of the soldier in the forced war (Leon Khechoyan, "Book S, heavy beetle").
It is due to this circumstance of being "forced" that the hero of Artsakh literature, no matter how brave and combative, does not stand out with the psychology of being a winner or invincible.
Many of the authors, in the critical period for Karabakh, measured all the paths of the struggle for survival with their feet and rifles, found the truth of living and creating, they know, they know, they understand what, when and how it happened.
  The military life is depicted in these works as it is, without any additional additions, emphasizing the heroism of the Armenian freedom fighters, not in the mountains, but in the psychology typical of the fighters who fight not to give up their own land.
"My book tells about that hard and difficult retreat, stretching from Getashen to the depths of Martakert.
 Retreat, but what kind of retreat, dramatic, heroic?
 During that difficult retreat, people were born, people died.
  It was not an escape… My heroes, yes, retreat, but they are not desperate, they are bleeding, but they are not bleeding.
 They are convinced that "they are waiting patiently for the moment when a breakthrough will finally enter the battlefield, a breakthrough that is not in the mountains."
 During that long and dignified retreat, their will and faith are tested, their truly heroic essence is revealed, their enlightened faith in their just struggle and tomorrow, in justice. "[2]
"Realizing that the probability of living and dying was fifty-fifty, we went to win ելու to live…" [3, p. 3].
 From the pages of Astvatsatur Petrosyan's "Suicide Squad" documentary book, this is what one of the suicide survivors of the war, a suicide bomber, says in the sense of the word "victory over death".
In general, in the pages related to that literature, the fiction is often inferior to the documentary.
 Perhaps because it is difficult to make sense of every past war for peace survivors, especially artistic reinterpretation.
  Especially since for many of them, in fact, the war is not over and continues under the name of ceasefire.
  The heroes of Hovhannes Yeranyan's collection of "Armistice" stories live with this awareness.
Authors with artistic incarnations often show their civic-patriotic stance towards the Artsakh liberation war or the Karabakh issue in general, sometimes assuming the role of a publicist, making their works a living response of time and a reflection of difficult days.
"One of the peculiarities of a modern novel is the interweaving of public discourse in epic wide canvases, the merging of elements of fiction into publicist genres.
 It is in these works that a number of human and moral problems are especially aggravated.
  "Where sometimes it is not possible to have a more direct and active influence on the repetitions of phenomena through means of art, to push new thoughts of the event in everyday life, public discourse is in many ways next to fiction" [1, p. 70], - writes S. Arzumanyan.
This reality is especially peculiar to the literature related to the Artsakh liberation war.
  In this sense, Vardan Drikyan's collection of articles "The Unstarted and Unfinished War" is significant, some of which are descriptions of various events of the time written by the eyewitness, participant իսկ, and the other part are articles of theoretical-analytical nature written by the courage of Artsakh's internal life.
When talking about the literature related to the Artsakh liberation war, it is necessary to stop at one of the most discussed issues in modern literature - the issue of the hero.
  Who is the hero of our literature? Why, in particular, in the literature on the Artsakh liberation war, the heroic soldier is not clearly outlined, or prose works glorifying and singing the image of a soldier are not written?
Thus. The Artsakh liberation war conditionally ended on May 9, 1992 with the capture of Shushi.
  According to experts, this turning point not only decided the course of the Artsakh war, but also predetermined the future fate of newly independent Armenia.
 It seemed that this reversal should have given new "praises" to Armenian literature, but it did not happen.
 In literary discussions, the phenomenon is justified as follows: There was a need to look at what happened from a distance ժամանակ with a new, sober eye.
To this day, it is difficult to single out heroic hymns dedicated to the capture of Shushi or the independence of our country in the literature related to the Artsakh liberation war.
 The reader, however, still waits for such pages, forgetting that the writer is not cut off from reality, that the biggest impression after the Artsakh war is the relative peace achieved in the forced war with difficulty, at the cost of blood and superhuman efforts.
  The writers who needed to write victory lines needed as much victorious spirit, which, as painful as it was, retreated in the face of the enemy, the defense of official Moscow, and the innate treachery of the enemy (in later years, all this was compounded by the apparent indifference of the authorities the life).
For our Armenians, this was a battle of honor, with an internal rebellion that made the impossible possible, with the realization of upholding national dignity, and in no case with a clear goal of leaving the historical and sacred homeland to the invaders, which is present in the relevant literature.
To create heroes with the psychology of a winner when the participants of the war feel the danger of defeat at every moment, when every Armenian who went to the battlefield, that he is a literary hero, first puts the death sentence in his pocket, when the only advantage over the enemy is the belief that It is called defense of the homeland, let's face it, it is not easy.
 If the Turkish-Azeris paid tribute to the criminal's appetite with that war, the Armenians of Artsakh defended their right to live freely in their homeland.
The Turk-Azeris took the other, the Armenian defended his own.
On the other hand, the difficulties of the first years of independence were faced by the "writer" of the joy of the liberation of Shushi.
  A new chronology was beginning outside the battlefield, the first years of which went down in history as "dark and cold."
 Along with all the difficulties of statehood, the values ​​changed in the society, the accepted truths were reinterpreted and the values ​​of the past were perceived in different ways.
 On the one hand, it was a period of creation of a new society, on the other hand, a period of demolition of the old one.
  Two completely different generations were outlined with their ideas. one as a standard-bearer of the struggle, the other as a silent witness to the values ​​of the past.
All this created a psychological barrier for the writer, did not allow him to give himself completely, albeit conditionally, to the joy of victory.
It is difficult to disagree with the literary critic Arkmenik Nikoghosyan. "And Armenian literature adopted not the policy of glorifying the war, even if it was victorious, but the policy of not saying war, not praising the victory of a soldier-freedom fighter, but his policy of depicting living in his own country as a marginal person after the victory.
  And the Armenian writer portrayed not the joy, but the pain, not the conquest of territories, but the loss of thousands of wonderful Armenians. "[4]
Artsakh literature is a general "no" to the war, the writers reject the phenomenon in general, using the peace of the Armenian borders in particular.
  Born literature always reminds us that victory was achieved at the cost of blood, and the unfinished war can start at any moment.
Speaking of Artsakh literature, it is necessary to dwell on the descriptions of one reality closely related to the topic: post-war life in Armenia.
  After independence, it seemed that there would be a rise, a national awakening and unity, but it did not happen.
 The frustration of the broad masses of the people was greater than the desire of the heroic people to live in their own country with a sense of dignity and a national ideology.
 The great wave of emigration entered the literature with the outpouring of writers losing their faith.
 Feelings of disappointment, of being more worthy but not receiving, of the deepening difficulties in the country day by day accompany the readers of the fiction of those years.
Looking back on the path of the freedom fighters and the unworthy lives of the boys who fought after independence, Khechoyan writes: "Boys, at whose feet the Azerbaijani land was howling, now the boys are complaining, they are on the street" [5].
The Armenian army is born page by page in the works related to the artistic chronicle of the Artsakh liberation war.
 The brightest point in almost all cases is the pride of the transition from irregular detachments to regular army.
  The writers consider the creation of the Armenian army to be the greatest achievement of the people who have not had an army for centuries, sometimes even more than independence.
  The army is sometimes perceived as a literary image. He is born, he knows his relations with the world, he is proud of his devoted children, he becomes wise, he keeps the enemy in fear and terror and he is proud of what he has done.
  The joy of the authors, especially the authors of the freedom fighters, is undisguised.
"I love our army the most in this country.
  Look at the history, see that you have not had an army for a century, and now we have one.
 That is pride.
  I think we must constantly give spirit, strengthen our army, it is the only guarantee of our independence, it is my and your pride, despite all the shortcomings ", [5] - Leon Khechoyan repeatedly repeats and artistically proves in his work.
Like every war, the Artsakh liberation war also gave birth to its heroes and revealed the devoted children of the nation.
 It seemed that after independence, those heroic children should talk to the new generation from the pages of books.
  The prevailing opinion in modern literature is that a worthy image of a soldier, general, villager has not been created.
 The reason is not at all that the heroes of the Artsakh war were less courageous when they defeated the armed enemy to the teeth with hunting rifles.
 Armenian men and women who inadvertently became soldiers were heroes, but there is an opinion that the literature that raises the heroic pages of modern history to the level of art will still be born.
  Perhaps Hrant Matosyan was right when, referring to the Great Genocide, he said that there are national and cherished topics, which with great difficulty become the subject of literature.
When talking about modern literature, we should not forget that independence somewhat independent literature, because it is known that the unique patterns and features of the characteristic development of each literary period are related to various political and national, social, moral, human and psychological factors.
  In this sense, the reinterpretation of the spiritual and cultural values ​​that take place naturally in our country, the changes that the society has undergone due to political transformations have had their impact on the literary process.
 Moreover, these influences not only led to thematic liberalization, but also revealed aesthetic and linguistic innovations.
As much as it seems that the documentary material dominates in the literature related to this topic, the fictional one is inferior, on the other hand, the historiography of the Artsakh liberation war is not based only on the study of facts. For each author, historical sources serve not only as a prelude, but also as a guide for the materialization of the material.
  That is why memories, notes, own diaries or newspapers are mostly historical sources in this literature.
The artistic approach to one's own past can be anchored on a private historical study և built on a subjective narrative.
  In this case, there will be questions (especially when dealing with so many questions), but we often come across writers describing the same case with the same characters, sometimes with the same analysis and descriptions of the cases.
 From this we can assume that the literary prototypes in the fiction that bring us the chronicle of the Artsakh liberation war are "fictional", "real, in fact, more often" or mostly real than fictional.
Naturally, the shorter the space between the story and the reader, the greater the risk of "not believing the writer."
  In this sense, the work of a modern writer is complicated. We must always remember that editing the story or "adapting it" is not allowed as long as the heroes who created the story live.
 On the other hand, there is an impression that writers sometimes had to do historical and historical studies in order not to miss in their observations or descriptions of historical holes.
Thus, for example, the analyzes of the writer Mkrtich Sargsyan sometimes reach in-depth observations, which leave the impression of a scientific study of the facts.
 Due to the author's knowledge, the Armenian of the end of the century has his position from "Gorbachev's perestroika to the declaration of independent statehood", which are not conclusions or imaginary illusions, but political and historical analyzes.
"… He tries to understand the truth, to look for the present and the future in the aftermath of a revolutionary life.
 Aramazd does not end his inner anxieties with the pessimistic prediction of the apocalypse.
 But the free and unfettered duplication of the original restores the pleasure of the classic novel, occupying the plot with philosophical references, often devoting whole pages to the analysis of phenomena, a fact that the novel stratifies with the publicist imagery of speech ”[6, p. 11].
The artistic description of the war is not only in finding out the "trench truth", especially if the given conflict in the political reality of the time continues to remain more undiscovered than the opposite.
We have already mentioned that the literature on the Artsakh liberation war, in addition to military operations, is also an artistic description of the social and political life of the time.
 There is a feeling of war in the images of civil life due to cause and effect. Everywhere war is an invisible reality or an expected evil. "Yerjan was boiling.
 The theater square was almost not empty.
 The people gathered here to "unwind", to be "charged", to "bury the past", to "save the future". There were many worries: worrying, unsolvable, unpredictable, "The bloodshed of Artsakh, the catastrophic state of the catastrophe" the blockade, the "powerlessness of the authorities," the windswept Soviet system that was collapsing at an apparent rate "[7, p. 81].
Thus, the theme of war has a main address in the modern Armenian prose - the Artsakh liberation war.
 The subject of our examination is fiction, fiction, sometimes inclusive documentary.
  The more you study the literature related to the topic, the more you come to the conclusion that despite all the criticisms and shortcomings, this literature is heroic literature, the modern page of the Armenian heroic story, where it may not be necessary to look for heroes. The hero of this literature, the war, is the Armenian man, who took up arms and everything that could have served as a weapon, defended the homeland, defended his right to exist, the hero is each of us who resisted with a clear awareness of not giving up the land and defending the homeland. The war and all the difficulties that followed.
More than 20 years have passed since the Artsakh war.
 To create serious literature, it is a kind of original chronicle somewhere.
There are not many references to this literature, that is, literary articles about this literature are either rare or not at all.
 Khechoyan art is an exception.
 The article tries to reveal and evaluate the Armenian fiction literature depicting the Artsakh liberation war and its peculiarities.
