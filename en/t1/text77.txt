The establishment of the institution of tripartism in the modern world order plays an important role in the implementation and strengthening of the effective policy of European democratic values, which is aimed at the formation of a three-vector "state-business-society" dialogue and the establishment of their cooperation.
  It is also especially important in the context of achieving the most important criterion in the multilateral integration paradigm of the large European family.
 340 POLITICS The precondition for the establishment of a tripartite system may be the signing of pacts between business and trade unions, the creation of a complex council, which will present the three vectors, the development of trade unions, and the study of socio-psychological aspects.
 The tripartite system, which is perceived as an integral part of democracy, and in the European world as an important category of democratic governance, is a powerful resource for more effective and just policies, which includes a major contribution to sustainable growth and development, fundamentally aimed at a strong society. together) to the creation.
  It is a form of three-vector dialogue and cooperation "business-society-state", which is aimed at representing entrepreneurship and public interests in state bodies and, accordingly, ensuring feedback, that is, receiving a specific attitude.
 The above system is quite widespread in the West, especially in the countries of the Continental European family (Germany, France, etc.), where it was considered as a separate scientific and educational field in the field of Public Affairs and Governmental Relations in 1940. starting from.
  In European countries, it initially led to corporatism, where tripartism became a natural component of the business-to-business or government-to-business relationship [1, P 170-172].
  It later turned into neo-corporatism, which, unlike corporativism, aims to strengthen its relationship with private business and government, not to weaken and depoliticize them.
 R.A. Dahl in his "Polyarchy. In the book "Participation and Opposition" he presents the existing connection between politics and society-economy, noting that they are interconnected, and the existence of one 341 POLITICS determines the existence of the other.
  He attributes the existence of a polyarchic state to the existence of a competitive policy, a pluralistic society and a decentralized economy, moreover, in such states a competitive policy can be implemented only in the presence of a pluralistic society, and the existence of the latter is conditioned by a decentralized economy.
  Therefore, in order to build a liberal and democratic country, the actions aimed at establishing a tripartite system must first be based on axiometric approaches {2, ะก 70-74ึ, where the correlation between the political system and the level of socio-economic development is very important.
  Considering this system in the PR and GR domains, it should be noted that the existence of a competitive political regime in the country is conditioned by the extent to which the society and the economy are guided by the "competitive policy-plural society system-decentralized economy" model. 1. Demonstrate literacy, education and communication skills; 2. Create a pluralistic society system instead of a centrally governed non-social system; 3. Prevent the emergence of extreme forms of inequality in the most politically significant part of society.
 Considering the tripartite system in the EU in the context of "democratic transition - consolidation", it should be noted that a number of circumstances have contributed to the establishment of such relations [3, P.6-10].
  In this regard, in Armenia, as in many other countries, which are in the domain of democratic transition, the preconditions for the development of social dialogue were created by the gravitational development of social partners in the context of general development, on the other hand, the successful experience of developed European countries in the field of social dialogue. ILO membership, as well as financial and organizational support from a number of international financial institutions to ensure macroeconomic stability and reform.
 In the Republic of Armenia, the vectors of the three-vector dialogue are the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs of the Republic of Armenia in the public sector, the General Union of Employers of Armenia in the field of employers, and the Confederation of Trade Unions of Armenia in the sector of workers.
  The foundation of this system was laid in the early 1990s, but the system is still in its infancy.
  It is true that the above-mentioned vectors perform certain functions within their competence, ensuring the interests of any of the separate vectors of the three-vector unity, but their activity, of course, cannot be comprehensively understood.
  Here we can cite the experience of a number of international countries, where there is a complex body representing the interests of individual vectors of a three-vector system.
  Such a complex body, for example, operates in Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and includes independent experts, headed by a person appointed by the Government, in Italy, where the Economic and Labor Council includes a wide range of different interest groups. France, whose Economic and Social Council combines representatives of interest and social groups representing economic, social and cultural interests into a single body.
  In other words, we can state that in Armenia it is necessary to address the problem with a systemic approach, emphasizing complex development, and not the development of isolated wings.
 The signing of national social pacts has also been a precondition for the establishment of a tripartite system in European countries in the last decade.
  These pacts are concluded between employers and trade unions, where the government also ensures its presence in various 343 POLITICAL WAYS.
  It is aimed at reducing unemployment, modernizing monetary policy, reforming the social security sector and redefining and modernizing a prosperous country in general.
 Thus, such pacts are also applicable to ensure the development of the system and may also be a prototype for concluding pacts in the Armenian reality.
  The development of a structure (trade union) that represents the interests of workers, which is a separate vector in the formation of tripartism, is also important.
  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, trade unions in the post-Soviet countries declined, failing to perform their primary function of protecting workers' interests and providing social guarantees due to the country's unstable financial situation and obsession with getting rid of former ideological unions.
  The problem is mainly that an ideological struggle is starting between the old and the new trade unions, because if in the past the interests of the trade union coincided with the interests of the state, in the current political system they should be based on the interests of the workers.
  In most Eastern European countries, the problem was solved within the framework of trade union cooperation, and in some cases their activities were weakened due to their subordination to the ruling oligarchic authorities.
  As a result, the terms "worker", "trade union", "social justice" and the like were considered backward, while the right to work, as a right enshrined in the human rights and constitutions of those countries, became almost an apparent right in the face of mass unemployment.
  This situation has not changed significantly, in many countries the unions are still underdeveloped, ceasing to be the main place of discharge of social energy.
  In the case of the Republic of Armenia, it is connected with a legislative omission, where, according to the RA Law on Trade Unions [4], financial resources are provided on the basis of a collective agreement, ie in this case the state does not define a specific amount of funds by law. They continue to be financially dependent on employers to continue.
 The convergence of political and business elites is also an obstacle to the establishment of a tripartite system in the countries in transition countries. that is, political processes begin to grow into political business, and in such a conflict of interest zone, a three-vector dialogue transforms into a two-vector one, reflecting a mirror image of a three-vector.
  Business elites try to represent their interests not in a delegated, but in person in a representative body, which begins to become an obstacle for the development of small and medium-sized businesses, not inclined to represent the interests of employees in this body.
  The next hub of the establishment of the system can be considered the existence of a monopoly and shadow economy in the country.
  In this case, the establishment of the system leads to the creation of a competitive field, and consequently to the creation of favorable conditions for workers, the economy is transformed into a "gray economy", and the workers into "black workers" {5, ะก. 134}, that is, a number of norms defined by the RA Labor Code are violated, which leads to the growth of social dissatisfaction among the people.
 It follows from the above-mentioned problems that the establishment of a tripartite system based on European experience in the Republic of Armenia is greatly hindered by the problems of the establishment of the information society, which are first of all conditioned by informational and social-psychological peculiarities. They hinder the effective use of GR (Government Relations) technologies in the three-vector state-business-society unity.
  This gap can be filled through PR technologies, by informing the public about the regular consultation process between trade unions and business organizations, ie, within the framework of system modernization, in addition to the problems of using GR technologies, PR problems are also identified, moreover, proper use of PR technologies and society necessary. The provision of information will also lead to the development of GR processes.
 Based on the above circumstances, we can state that the shortcomings in the establishment of the tripartite system in the Republic of Armenia have no legal basis, but are largely socio-psychological (lack of competition, lack of awareness of legal acts, etc.) and are due to institutional shortcomings, and the political elite in turn does not show sufficient will to undertake the necessary reforms and to observe the constitutionality and legal norms.
 Thus, studying the prospects and challenges of modernization of public institutions in Armenia, comparing and analyzing them within the framework of European experience, and judging by the above circumstances, we can state that the establishment of a tripartite system in Armenia is a "business-society-state". It is a form of three-vector cooperation aimed at representing the interests of entrepreneurship and society in state bodies and strengthening the most important factor on the path to European integration.
  Finally, with regard to the effective operation of the tripartite system in the Republic of Armenia, the fact that the collective subjects of responsibility must be carried out in a purposeful institutionalized consolidation is important.
 The tripartite system is seen as a powerful resource for nation-building through democratic consolidation, the introduction of which in Armenia, based on the multifaceted value of European experience, is likely to lead to the establishment and modernization of public institutions in Armenia. In turn, the path of Armenia's European integration will be an important impetus and a fundamental value-oriented direction in the context of effective overcoming of strategic issues.
