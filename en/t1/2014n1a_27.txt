 In line with the issues of organizational stabilization, we are also looking for dependencies in the context of a changing economy that allow us to describe economic manifestations more accurately.
 In this regard, it should be noted that one of the basic principles of valuing organizations is the assertion that market value directly depends on the amount of net income.
  In this case, the capitalization rate is determined by the following formula: KN = ZGE / KSA, (1), where: KN - capitalization norm, ZGE - is the net operating income, KSH - is the market value of the organization.
Assigning the value of the capitalization rate through the net income multiplier M = 1 / KN, we will get the following formula: KSHA = M x ZGE, (2).
As follows from Equation (2), in the partial case, if the net income is equal to zero, the market value of the entity will also be zero.
 If the real estate of the organization does not bring income, the liquidation value of the property in certain cases is equal to zero, but usually it has a positive value, because even in case of complete liquidation of the organization, the materials can be used in case of dismantling of buildings.
 Therefore, it cannot be argued that a malicious organization has no value.
In the framework of the above methodological approach, based on the problem of stabilization of organizations, using the method of determining the point of safety, let's identify the factors that affect the amount of net operating income.
 Make the appropriate appointments in the table below.

ZGE = Shminch և taxation - Shminch և taxation x SHD + A = Shminch և taxation x (1 - SHD) + A, (3).
  From formula (3) we can determine the market value of the organization. KSHA = M x ZGE = M x [Shmincև taxation x (1 - SHD) + A], (4).
In case of critical sales volume, the profit at the point of non-profit before taxation will be equal to zero: Shminch taxation = 0.
 In this case, the market value of the unprofitable organization will be determined in the following way: MSW = MxA, (5).
Consider a case where the value of a harmless entity is equal to its liquid value (CR), which, paradoxically, is equal to the capitalized amount of annual depreciation allocations: LA = M x A, (6).
If we take into account that our assumption is within the allowable limits, it allows us to apply new approaches for rapid assessments.
 In this case, the market value of the organization can be represented as the sum of the capitalized value of the liquidation value (value of the harmless organization) և net operating income. KSA = LA + M x ZGE, (7).
In case of harmless activity of the organization, its value will be equal to the following: ZGE = 0, KSA = LA.
If the organization operates at full capacity of the production program, we will have the following: ZGE = maximum, MSMA = maximum + LA + M x ZGE max = SA.
In case of a decrease in sales due to the influence of external unfavorable factors, we will have the following: ZGE = ZGEpastatsi, KSA actual = LA + M x ZGEPastatsi.
Based on the above, we can make the following conclusions: • The market value of the organization can be equal to zero only in case of unprofitable activity.
• Excluding goodwill, the entity's maximum value will be equal to its initial cost, which allows it to use the full potential of the entity to obtain the maximum possible net operating income.
• The market value of an entity receiving net operating income in the amount of ZGEPast will be calculated as follows: actual KSA = LA + [(SA - LA) / (ZGE Maxim-ZGEcritical) x (ZGEPastasi-ZGEcritical)], (8).
• The total wear and tear probability can be determined as follows: UM = SA-KSHA, (9).
Considering that the market value of the organization is determined by the best possible potential values ​​in accordance with the most effective principles, and not by actual values, the following approach can be applied.
Actual sales in value terms: IH, on the one hand, is equal to the quantity of products sold, IJ և unit price of the product - MG, to the product, and on the other hand, is equal to conditional fixed production costs - NAP, total variable production costs - PPP; taxation, on the amount: IH = MG x IJ = EPATS + HATS + Shmincև taxation = MG x IJ + HATS + Shminch և taxation (10).
(10) Subtract the following formula from the calculation of profit before tax: Shminch taxation = IZ x (MG - MAPATS) - BREAD, (11).
     Placing this expression in formula (4), we get the following: KSHA = M x ZGE = M x [Shminch և taxation x (1 - SHD) + A] = M x Ծ [Ծ x (MG - MAPAGH) - HAJ] x (1 - SHD) + A}, (12).
Considering that the programmatic, maximum net operating income will be equal to the following: in ZGEmaxim = [in Maximax x (MG - MAPAGE) - BREAD] x (1 - SHD) + A, and the program cost of new construction - KSA = SA.
 Therefore, the net programmatic animator will be equal to: M = SA / {[Maximum x (MG - MAPAGE) - BREAD] x (1 - SD) + A}, (13).
Putting expression (13) in expression (11), we will get one of the alternative formulas for calculating the market value of the organization: KSHA = SA x {[IX x (MG - MAPAGH) - HAGH] x (1 - SD) + A / [Maximum x (MG - ՄԱՊԱԾ) - ՀԱԾ] x (1 - ՇԴ) + Ա}, (14).
The resulting formula combines revenue and expenditure approaches.
 From the user's point of view, the availability of its perception is considered a positive factor in terms of applying this approach.
         At the same time, we use the approach of calculating the market value of the organization, which is proportional to the volume of product sales.
  The calculation formula is as follows. (SA - LA) / (Maximum - Critical) = (KSA - LA) / (Actual - Critical) KSA = LA + (SA - LA) x (Maximum - Critical) / (Maximum - Critical), (15).
