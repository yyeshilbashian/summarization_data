1. Introduction.
 The solution of a number of mathematical, physical, technical problems of other nature requires the calculation of the values ​​of elementary functions for different values ​​of the variable.
  For this reason, tables of values ​​of trigonometric functions were created in the Middle Ages, as well as formulas for calculating the approximate values ​​of some functions.
  Later, the calculation of the values ​​of elementary functions as well as the creation of similar tables were a stimulus for the development of mathematics and its applications.
  For this purpose, the theory of series, chain fractions, orthogonal polynomials, etc., through which the elementary functions were presented, their values ​​were determined, were widely used.
 Prior to the development of the latest technologies, various algorithms were written for calculating the values ​​of elementary functions, block diagrams in BASIC, PASCAL, FORTRAN, C և other programming languages, which enabled the computer "Strela", BSM-6, M-2, M3, Ural. M-220, EC, as well as Nairi, Hrazdan type calculators to calculate these values ​​very quickly.
 In recent years, computer mathematics kits have been developed by relevant specialists, which are a powerful tool for solving various mathematical problems, in particular, for calculating the values ​​of elementary functions.
 These computer kits are available for both professionals and anyone with computer skills.
 Similar packages are MAPLE, MATHEMATICA, MATLAB, MACSYMA այլ other computer packages.
  In particular, the MAPLE package is a powerful and flexible tool for solving various mathematical problems.
 The more than 2000 commands of the package make it possible to solve problems in algebra, mathematical analysis, differential equations, and a number of other areas, in particular, to calculate the values ​​of elementary functions for different values ​​of a variable.
  The work with the MAPLE package is that the user enters mathematical expressions into the computer միջոցով commands through operators, and the package instantly executes those commands ք output the answer.
  The work with the package is done through dialogue.
  Entered expressions Commands are stored in a single document, allowing the user to see the progress of actions.
    The interface of the MAPLE package is similar to the interface of any editorial system, which allows programmers by profession to take advantage of the package [3,4].
 In addition to all this, it also contains modern high-level programming languages.
The first part of this work presents one of the main methods for calculating whole multiplicity values, the wells scheme, and the second part presents information related to the MAPLE computer package, which can be used to calculate the values ​​of the whole multiplicity, interpolation, construct graphs of functions, etc.
2. Calculate the value of the whole polynomial using the well scheme.
Consider the whole polynomial with real coefficients to the first degree [1,2]. Suppose it is necessary to calculate (1) the value of the whole polynomial for - (2) To calculate the value, proceed as follows: Let (2) be represented as follows: By calculating the quantities in sequence, we will find, that is, the value of (1) the polynomial
in.
In practice, the operations described above are performed using the following scheme called the Horn Scheme.
 Using the Wells scheme, calculate Thus the value of a polynomial in.

1232P Note that the quantities are the coefficients of the quadratic that divides the polynomial into bisectors [1].
 Indeed, let's put where we will have for the remainder of the division, according to Bezuhiteorem.
Putting (6) in (5) և opening the brackets, we will have. Comparing (1) և (8) the relations և equalizing the coefficients in front of the members, we will get: we will have the same from (9) to և (4). which և had to be proved.
 Thus, the wells scheme allows him to determine the coefficient ուց the remainder of dividing the whole polynomial by dividing it without dividing.
For example.

Thus.
It should be noted that in terms of the speed of calculating the values ​​of the whole polynomial, the well scheme is the most rational of all the other methods.
 3. Calculation of the value of the whole polynomial through the computer MAPLE package.
Any function in the MAPLE computer package, in particular the whole polynomial, can be represented in several ways [3,4].
          Season 1.
 The whole polynomial can be represented.
=) through the operator, as a result of which that polynomial is assigned a name.
 In the next step, by giving specific values ​​to the variable, the value of the polynomial for the variable value will be instantly determined by the same operator.
For example.
  Calculation in.
  2nd method of polynomial.
  A multiple member can be represented by a so-called functional operator.
 In this case it is used again (.
=) the operator, after which, unlike the previous case, the variable is indicated in round brackets, as shown below.

 Calculation in.
    3rd method of polynomial.
 The polynomial can also be represented by the command unapply (expr, x1, x2,…), where the polynomial is represented instead of expr, and the variables are represented instead of x1, x2,։.
For example.
 Calculation in.
    In each example discussed in the polynomial, the answer is output within a second.
Note that the MAPLE computer package has the ability to instantly construct an exact polynomial given by the command plot (p (x), x = a..b), where p (x) is the polynomial in question and a..b is the range is where the schedule should be built.
For example.
 Construction chart in between. polynomial The graph of a polynomial can be constructed in the given range by interpolation, when several values ​​of the polynomial are known at points in that range.
  According to those key points, the values ​​obtained by the polynomial in those points, two lists are created. first the X list for node points, then the Y list for the values ​​obtained by the polynomial at those node points.
 The next interp (X, Y, x) command performs the interpolation, where x is the interpolation variable.
And the resulting interpolated polynomial graph can already be constructed using the above plot (p (x), x = a..b) command.
Comparing the graph constructed in this way with the exact graph constructed above, we make sure that they are quite different from each other (graph 1 shows the exact graph of the function, and graph 2 represents the interpolated polynomial graph).
In order to reduce this difference, it is necessary to increase the number of nodes և and then perform interpolation.
Constructing the graph of an interpolated polynomial in this way ևcomparing it to its exact graph դեպքում in the case of the interpolated polynomial in the previous case, we already have the following image schedule) .4. Conclusion Thus, this methodological work briefly presents the main method of calculating the value of the whole polynomial, Hornerskhema, կոնկրետ concrete examples are considered.
 Then, from the point of view of calculating the values ​​of all polynomials, the possibilities of the computer MAPLE package are presented, their application when considering specifics.
 The high efficiency of the package is shown in terms of simplicity of commands ժամանակ time spent on calculations.
 If necessary, the construction of both the exact and the approximated graph of the given polynomial is within the possibilities of the package, when the specific values ​​of the polynomial are determined at different points of the observed range, interpolation is performed by the formulas included in the package.
It is also planned to present similar methodological works in connection with the calculation of the values ​​of non-algebraic basic elementary functions.
