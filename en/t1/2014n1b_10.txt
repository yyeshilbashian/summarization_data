Political communication is based on the ongoing dialogue between the "political institutions" of the society, which turns into an ongoing dialogue between different governments, states and peoples.
 The bearer of the constructive or destructive consequences of the latter is the people.
  In this respect, the hypersensitivity of today's politicized society to political processes is remarkable, as well as the awareness of verbal influence and the growing interest in the news that exposes it.
 The urgency of this topic is substantiated by the fact of the politicization of the modern society, the high level of awareness, the critical perception of information.
 For the first time an attempt is made to reveal և a comprehensive case study of the typology of typification by US President B. In Obama's speeches.
The study of political texts reveals patterns of speech construction, a certain frequency of the use of means of influence on the audience within the framework of individual language-style features.
 This allows us to talk about the tricks of verbal influence as pre-existing phenomena, "which are constantly referred to by the representatives of this or that national-linguistic-cultural community in their speech, with which acquaintance in the given community is considered mandatory.
  Such predispositions include special names, references, etc. ”(Krasnykh, 1998).
52).
 The precedent is a fact with a verbal arrangement, which was pre-operated in the verbal activity of the members of a certain linguistic and cultural community; it serves as an example for the following similar facts (Alefirenko, 2002).
10).
Central to the communication system is the verbal strategy, followed by the verbal trick.
  The latter refers to the strategy as the private to the general (see ерернявская, 2006) և acts as a concrete communication step in the implementation of the strategy.
  Each strategy assumes a multiplicity of tricks, united under a common strategic goal.
"Verbal dexterity is a functional unit of sequence of actions that facilitates localized or global problem-solving under the control of strategy" (see T. vanDeyek, 1989).
  V. Chernyavskaya identifies verbal-communication trick և verbal tactics (technique) (Chernyavskaya, 2006.
45) distinguishing between "linguistic" and "non-linguistic" expressions of speech technique.
The study of political discourse allows for a variety of verbal tricks, the most important of which is standardization.
The ability to standardize events և facilitates the stereotyping of events, events և individuals, while ignoring the features, features և features.
The art of typification is practically realized by condensing similar elements into a whole class of one character or a single character.
The purpose of turning an image or reality into a stereotype becomes apparent in various speeches.
 To illustrate the point, consider the following examples: This long excerpt from a speech in North Carolina on May 6, 2008, includes four paragraphs, four statements, each of which illustrates the various issues that concern the public.
  In this part of the speech we see the use of a quadruple of the standardization technique.
Each of the sayings begins with the mention of individuals, with the joint introduction of a certain article և noun (the woman / the collegestudent / the mother / the man).
 Here the speaker uses induction, referring to private problems, in fact indirectly implying self-awareness of the problems of different social strata, giving them a new sound.
  At first glance, it seems that the speaker fixes indisputable facts and realities, but the listener's attention is not focused on the problems of an individual, but on the one hand, people dissatisfied with such problems are generalized, on the other hand, the politician's awareness is removed.
 He does not hesitate to respond accordingly, expressing a willingness to solve problems, which is manifested by a voice at the end of each of the tricks (That's why I'm running for President).
 At the same time, the formulation of thought through syntactic parallelism becomes a powerful trick, because "the habituation of the speaker, whatever he calls, through its repetition, often ends with the substantiation of the obviousness of that fact" (Shelestak, 2006).
157).
  The epiphora at the end of each of the tricks complements and conveys the thought being conveyed.
It is noteworthy that the same examples were found in the other speech, which testifies to the predisposition of the possible typification. The structural similarities of the examined sayings are evident. Repeated use in the same context; third, the rhyme of each possible message, through the repetition of which the necessary idea of ​​the speaker is introduced or rooted in the listener's consciousness.
Maybe with duplicity և if (if) with a secondary sentence inserted conditionally (anaphora) B. Obama makes serious accusations against his political opponent, hinting at the fact that the latter is unaware of the problems of the people, indirectly advising him to get acquainted with them first, and then to seek solutions.
In this case, the trick is concluded according to the neurolinguistic programming, the confirmation of the relationship (report) between the listeners' stated realities (And it was about all of you), followed by the connection (attachment) 's Grinder, Bandler, 1993.
18-19 med. according to Shelestak, 2006.
153), which is manifested by the following formulation: You understand these stories because you or someone you love lived them.
 In many works devoted to the analysis of political discourse, the pronouns I և we, which have been recognized as "politicized" linguistic units, have been examined many times (see Vander Zanden, 1977).
280, cit. according to Baghdasaryan, 2011.
103).
  But no less valuable և practically effective means is the launch of the pronoun you.
  Thus, in the quoted example (You understand these stories because you or someone you lovelived them) it becomes obvious that the pronoun you in this context neutralizes the orator's opinion. it becomes the “inner voice” of the listener, awakening in him the recollection of his personal life experience.
 At the same time, the use of you relieves the speaker of the need to prove what is being said, emphasizing the speaker's awareness, citing the speaker's own experience.
  The knowledge of the speaker becomes "persuasive" means in the "hand" of the speaker.
  This reduces the "distance" between the speaker's opinion and the speaker's knowledge, in fact identifying them.
  We find similar uses of the pronoun You in his speech at Grand Park on November 4. The typification trick is available in B. In Obama's speech, in the narration of his own biography. In this case, the emphasis is on the president's African-American descent (Primary Night Texas and Ohio San Antonio, TX, March 4, 2008).
In this program, Barack Obama subconsciously inspires his audience to think that he is the embodiment of the American dream.
 Let's take into account that the concept of the American dream is an example of standardization and stereotyping of the way of life.
In fact, the speaker uses the technique of anchoring, which is one of the basic tools of neurolinguistic programming.
 According to J. O'Connor J. Seymour. "Anchors are all that can cause emotional distress, they are so obvious and widespread that we do not notice them" (O'Connor, Seymour, 2011- http.
//www.psycho.all.ru).
 There are two ways of anchoring. The first is repetition, which strengthens the association in the consciousness of the communicator, and the second is the right action at the right time, which frees it from the need for repetition.
  The use of anchoring in the studied tricks is appropriately justified, and the repetition is manifested through the playing of the same characters in different speeches.
The trick under consideration stands out with the unique realization of linguistic tricks.
 In this invention, concurrency is a combination of parallels, syntactic parallelism, rhetorical question և addition (pleonasm) (get the chance / find opportunity / have the chance).
Addition is a semantic translation, which is interpreted as a duplication of a semantic element (duplication), the existence of several linguistic forms, which express the same meaning within the end of the speech or the final part of the text.
 The linguistic expression ևs is considered an addition if it contains a duplicate.
 The appendix helps the recipient to adequately և fully understand the message.
The use of standardization during the election campaign contributes to the formation of the image of the candidate, he makes him close to the people, as the listener is always willing to listen to his own problems, which becomes possible by addressing the current issues by the example of an individual.
