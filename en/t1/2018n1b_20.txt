Grigor TatatsiEach period has its own characteristics and goals, from which derive certain nominations to the educational system.requirements.
 However, it should be noted that schooling is notև Experience has shown that every innovation must be re-anchored և years (in the case of the Armenian people, centuries) of expertise.on the educational culture they have overcome.
 Thus, for example, as T. mentions.Juharyan, we have had one used in the Armenian school since the 5th centuryA number of effective verbal methods: narrative, interpretive, descriptive, interrogative, lecture, etc. [7].
 School և educationAlong with the development, the verbal methods are also improved,[Practical] methods are developed, making verbal methods more effective and productive [7].
Global developments, educational space reviews, the demand for development education և new challenges ourThe education system poses some serious problems that require a more flexible schooling policy, combining an acceptable new one to integrate into the world.The best known tradition with undeniable efficiency.
Everyone knows the effectiveness of teachingThe role of a teacher is incomparable. His personal charm, his love of the learner's subject matter are a precondition, but the method he has chosen may be the methodical tricks derived from it.
 This wayThe teaching of Old Armenian, the role and significance of which is not an exceptionboth for the study of Armenian and Armenian history, as welland it is incomparable for the presentation and perception of the church ritual.
  That is why they study in Greek like in universitiesin historiography departments, high school humanities stream,both in the sanctuaries and the seminaries, of courseProfessional orientation of each ները Teaching goals.
In this article we will try to present some methodologiestricks that we think are effective in teaching Grabartime.
Let us mention the role of the teacher again, addressing our caring fathers. "If:
Teachers stingily teach students what they know,They will be condemned even more than the stingy.
 Because the stingy are afraidSpend money on my head or give something to the needy, knowing that the more they give to others, the less they have of their property, butteachers are not so afraid, because they are like a lamp of light,from which no matter how many lamps are lit, its light will not diminish.
 Especially since they know from experience that their knowledge increases, not decreases with the classification:according to the proverb. "He who teaches, learns himself" [3].
Teacher dedication is first and foremost professionalwith progress. Continuous work, methodological-experimental research create opportunities for effective teaching.
Of course, a solid presentation of the grammatical material should be used.
 It is not by chance that since the early medieval period "grammar" was deposited in monastic schools and monasteries as a prelude to the study of all other key subjects.for "[7].
  According to Arakel Syunetsi, grammar as the subject of study is the parts of speech, and the goal is the language.regulation and improvement [7].
Guided by the above, when teaching GrabarWe want to separate the verb related to the verb from the grammatical materialHere are some key pointers in moving forward with the topic.
  It should be noted that since the 8th century, Stepanos Syunetsi, based on the role they played in classifying parts of speech, singled out the verb, considering it the center of the sentence.core [7].
In teaching the verb, it is very important to pay attention to the rhetoric. we know that in the Old Armenian there were four adjectives: a, e, i,
and, in modern Armenian, two: a, e.
Especially in the case of timelines based on the presentThere are no big complications in case of injuries. We think that in this case, especially the comparative comparison is enough, especially at the stage of class consideration.
 Moreover, the comparison can be presentedboth by writing the example of bowing on the board and presenting itAn example of a pre-compiled comparison chart using a poster.
Grabara bow / -al / playe bow / -el / askin humility / -il / meditation and bow / -ul / wake up Modern Armeniana bow / -al / playe bow / -el / ask                                   to think                                   wake upIt is possible to present the grammatically relevant materialThen bring a comparison table with modern Armenian 9, emphasizing the commonalities.
  Let us bring the borderline imperfect present to the bowcomparative example.   GrabarE bowModern ArmenianE bowA bowA bowI play:Play:Play:Game:Games:Game:I'm runningare you runningis runningwe are runningare you runningthey runI playyou are playingplays:we are playingare you playingthey are playingI will runRunRunLet's runRun!RunIn this case, one can bring the example of modern Armenian'sfrom the sound commonalities of the weather (Grabar's imperfect present's sound coincides with the modern Armenian's dream), asby turning the grammar material into a mechanical template, moreto make the utterance visible and perceptible, as I am running +, that is,to remove whose imperfect ending.
We can use the Wen diagram, the use of which helps to see and understand grammatical contemporaneous realities together, distinguishing similarities and differences.
 Thought:The use of this technique is quite effective, especially in dealing with difficult-to-understand grammatical materials, such as the perfect past tense, which has some difficulties such asin terms of the types of conjugation (intransitive, passive և mixed), as well as in terms of verb bases.
 The issue of education complicates it even morein the sense that according to the school curriculum, reference is not made to verbs.
 That is why we offer to make practical training by video comparison. that is, to present Grabaryan և
9 Note that the use of tables also dates back to the Middle AgesIt was applicable in the Armenian reality.
  For example, Isaiah mentioned "GrammarAttached to the work "Analysis" is the teaching of the verb conjugation table moreto make it efficient and easy.

Example A. Introductory bow

 Of course, it is desirable that in the original copiesThe perfect perfect past tense should first be similar to modern Armenian, then we should refer to the different ones, moreover, we have brought them formed on a radical-linguistic basis.
Identical Grabarian և Modern Armenian versionsThey told the high priest everything that had happened.
 They sealed it togetherthe military.

Horses different from modern Armenian As the Father has sent me, and I will send you.
 And he healed them.

 Lord, when did you see yourself hungry and fed or thirsty and drunk?
Modern Armenian similar to eggs, but different in meaningWhen did you see yourself as a stranger and you gathered or naked and clothed yourself?
  When did you see yourself?sick or in prison, you came to you.
  Lord, did you not prophesy in your name and in your name?Take out your devil and do many things for my sake.
 Why didn't you do it?take him out.
By the way, it is not accidental to use the original copies,because it was an accepted form of traditional teaching. Language և:
Joint original teaching of literature is highly effectiveto provide.
 In this respect, it is not accidental that, for example, Grigor MagistrosGrammar views literature as the origin of grammarconnecting with literature [7,15].
  And Vardan Archeltsi is a grammarianto make the material more substantial as original examplesHe brought folk fables, proverbs, sayings, mythsetc. [7, 19].
As for the content of the original copies, we think it is desirable that the original for the gift և lyceumsThe material will be selected from the well-known literature or church rites, and in the history courses, from historiography;from source science.
  This is how you can ensure "interdisciplinary"substantiate the connection with the knowledge gained from related subjects.
